{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'jaozyco3x7mbglwa', reading a specific variable from a module and defining package dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading the '__init__.py' file in 'closeio_api' directory and extracting a specific string value using regex.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or execute untrusted data; it mainly reads files and sets up package metadata.",
  "flows": "The regex extraction reads a value from the file, which is then assigned to a setup parameter. No untrusted data flows into sensitive functions or network calls.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are obfuscated (e.g., 'maEJnpfeCHXkSIqSKyYfldCLFUsIOfKe', 'jcdJMIqctBWHLKBtBTPjqIGusRUhRuVz'), which could indicate an attempt to conceal purpose. The regex extraction could be used to hide malicious configuration, but on its own, it appears benign.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries and uses regex to extract a string from a specific file. The setup call defines package metadata and dependencies, with no evidence of malicious activity. The obfuscated variable names are unusual but not inherently malicious. No network, file write, or execution of untrusted code is present. Overall, the code appears to be a standard setup script with some obfuscation possibly intended to hide the source of configuration data.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a typical setup script for a Python package with obfuscated variable names and regex extraction, but no malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. It does not perform any harmful actions or suspicious data flows.",
