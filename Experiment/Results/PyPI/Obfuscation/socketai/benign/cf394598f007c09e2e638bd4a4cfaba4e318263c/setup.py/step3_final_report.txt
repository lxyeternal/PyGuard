  "purpose": "Extracts a version string from 'closeio_api/__init__.py' using regex and uses it in setup() for package configuration.",
  "sources": "Reads 'closeio_api/__init__.py' file, extracts a string assigned to 'yDHTpSmKCvqKZnFdKosmLXZxwleZyOTt' via regex.",
  "sinks": "Uses the extracted string as the version parameter in setup(), no other untrusted data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Reads file -> applies regex to extract version string -> passes string to setup() as version.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names and regex pattern with multiple escaped backslashes, indicating obfuscation but not necessarily malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code reads a specific file and extracts a string via regex, then uses it in setup(). No network activity, code execution, or data exfiltration is present. Obfuscation is evident but not malicious. The regex pattern is straightforward, targeting a specific variable assignment. No signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, backdoors, or data theft are detected. The obfuscation may be for concealment but does not imply malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with this analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation appears to be a concealment tactic rather than an indicator of malicious intent. Overall, the code is benign, and the security risk is minimal.",
