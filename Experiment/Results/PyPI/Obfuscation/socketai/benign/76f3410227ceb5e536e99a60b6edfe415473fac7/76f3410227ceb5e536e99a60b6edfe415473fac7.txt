      "conclusion": "The script is a benign package configuration file with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not constitute malicious intent based on this code. The malware score is set to 0, and the security risk is very low (~0.15)."

      "conclusion": "The code does not contain active malware or malicious payloads but is heavily obfuscated and has security weaknesses related to data handling and token management. It appears to be a complex, custom authentication system with potential for misuse if compromised, but no evidence of malicious sabotage or malware."
