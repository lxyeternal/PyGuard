{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for packaging a Python project named 'MkAuth'. It reads a README.md file for the long description and calls setuptools.setup() with static metadata, including an obfuscated variable name for the description and email.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file, static strings for package metadata, and uses setuptools.find_packages() for package discovery.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no network calls, data leaks, or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "flows": "Static data flows from file read and hardcoded strings into the setup() function; no external or untrusted data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated variable names for strings (e.g., description, email), redundant variable overwriting, but no malicious code or dynamic behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script with obfuscated variable names. No malicious behavior such as network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration is present. The obfuscation appears stylistic or for concealment but does not indicate malicious intent. The static email address seems legitimate. The overall structure is benign, with no security vulnerabilities or malicious signals detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign package configuration file with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not constitute malicious intent based on this code. The malware score is set to 0, and the security risk is very low (~0.15).",
