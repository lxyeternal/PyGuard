  "purpose": "Setuptools configuration for packaging the MkAuth Python project.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file; hardcoded package metadata such as name, version, author, description, URL, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no data is being sent or written to external systems or untrusted locations.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md content; setting package metadata in setup() function.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names (e.g., 'kgJRijwzjkWFobzcFYlQMddIORqQsIgw', 'zmmJxXvTzfJqoqkjEzDBHegrNqYifVUv'), which may suggest obfuscation or attempts to hide intent; the variable for 'long_description' is overwritten unnecessarily. No evidence of malicious code such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code reads a Markdown file to include as a long description, which is standard. It defines package metadata with seemingly random variable names, which is unusual but not malicious. The setup() call uses find_packages() to discover packages and specifies classifiers. There is no dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious logic. The variable names could be a form of obfuscation or just arbitrary naming, but no malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with obfuscated variable names. There is no malicious or maliciously intended behavior detected. The obfuscation may raise some suspicion but does not constitute malicious activity based on the provided code.",
