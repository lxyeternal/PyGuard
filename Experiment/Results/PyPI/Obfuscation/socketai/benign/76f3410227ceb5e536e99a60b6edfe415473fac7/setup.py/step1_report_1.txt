{
  "purpose": "Configure and set up the Python package 'MkAuth' for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description, static strings for package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leak points identified.",
  "flows": "Data from the 'README.md' file is assigned to a variable, but not used in a malicious way; package metadata is static.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names (e.g., 'kgJRijwzjkWFobzcFYlQMddIORqQsIgw') that appear obfuscated or randomly generated; the variable holding the email address is also obfuscated.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily imports setuptools, reads a README file, and calls setuptools.setup() with static arguments. The variable names are obfuscated or nonsensical, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. The email address is stored in an obfuscated variable, but it is assigned a static string ('mark@mknxgn.com') that appears to be a legitimate email. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or data leaks are present. The purpose is straightforward package setup, with no suspicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names but no evidence of malicious intent or malicious code. The obfuscation appears to be for concealment or style rather than malicious purposes.",
