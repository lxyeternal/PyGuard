{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package named 'MkAuth' with metadata and dependencies, using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads content from 'README.md' file for long description; contains hardcoded package metadata such as author email and package information.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or executed. No dynamic code execution or network connections within the code.",
  "flows": "Reads the README file content and then passes static data into setuptools.setup() for package configuration. No external data flow or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variable names (e.g., 'kgJRijwzjkWFobzcFYlQMddIORqQsIgw', 'zmmJxXvTzfJqoqkjEzDBHegrNqYifVUv', 'rUVpPOeeMLyTsWTnPRQEIUucLdZHwFNq') which are unusual and do not conform to standard naming conventions; these appear to be random strings, possibly obfuscated.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package, with the only notable anomaly being the use of obfuscated variable names. The content reads a README file and passes static metadata to setuptools.setup(), which is standard. No dynamic execution, network activity, or suspicious logic is present. The obfuscated variable names may be intended to hide code intent but do not directly indicate malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard package setup script with obfuscated variable names, which could be suspicious but on its own does not indicate malicious intent. The script appears benign, but the obfuscation warrants caution or further review of the context in which this code is used.",
