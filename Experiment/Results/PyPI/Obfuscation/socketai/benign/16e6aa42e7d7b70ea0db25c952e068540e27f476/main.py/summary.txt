  "conclusion": "The script functions as a schema reflection and ORM model generator with significant obfuscation and dynamic import patterns. While these features could be exploited maliciously, there is no direct evidence of malware or malicious payloads. The main concern is the potential for obfuscation to hide malicious modules, especially if the code is sourced from untrusted origins. It should be handled with caution, and static analysis or sandbox testing is recommended before deployment."
