{
  "purpose": "Evaluate the supply chain security of the open source dependency by analyzing provided code reports for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code reading environment variables, input functions, network/file operations, and potential data flows.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks through environment variables, inputs, or network/file outputs.",
  "flows": "Sources to sinks include reading environment variables or inputs, possibly leading to data exfiltration or malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, suspicious API calls, or malicious patterns detected; code is minimal or absent.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate either no code or minimal benign code, with no suspicious patterns or anomalies. Malware scores are consistently zero, aligning with the absence of malicious indicators. Risk scores are low (~0.2), justified by the limited or no code content. Confidence levels vary but are appropriate given the evidence. The assessments are consistent and conservative, reflecting the minimal activity and benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low risk and malware scores are appropriate, and the overall security posture is considered safe based on the provided reports.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
