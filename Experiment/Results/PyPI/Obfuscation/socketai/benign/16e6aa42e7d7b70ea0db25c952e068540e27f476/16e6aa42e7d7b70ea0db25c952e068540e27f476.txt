      "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated ORM and schema generation framework that, while complex and potentially exploitable via injection if inputs are untrusted, shows no direct signs of malware or malicious payloads. The primary risk stems from dynamic code assembly and reflection, which require careful input validation. The overall security risk is moderate, and the malware likelihood is low."

      "obfuscated": 0.7,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The script functions as a schema reflection and ORM model generator with significant obfuscation and dynamic import patterns. While these features could be exploited maliciously, there is no direct evidence of malware or malicious payloads. The main concern is the potential for obfuscation to hide malicious modules, especially if the code is sourced from untrusted origins. It should be handled with caution, and static analysis or sandbox testing is recommended before deployment."
