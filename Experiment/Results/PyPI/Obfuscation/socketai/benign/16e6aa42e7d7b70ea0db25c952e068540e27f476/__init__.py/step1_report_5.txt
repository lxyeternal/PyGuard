  "flows": "Not applicable (simple assignment)",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable name 'nzHxovazNxjOWgzzTbdDswNtiATCygbj' which appears randomly generated or obfuscated; no meaningful variable naming",
  "analysis": "The code assigns the string '2.0.0' to two variables: a highly obfuscated variable 'nzHxovazNxjOWgzzTbdDswNtiATCygbj' and the special attribute '__version__'. The presence of a nonsensical variable name suggests obfuscation, but there is no active malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or malicious logic. The code simply sets version metadata, which is common in Python modules. No external input or untrusted data sources are involved. The obfuscated variable name could be an attempt to hide or confuse, but it does not in itself indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version assignment with an obfuscated variable name. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation appears superficial, likely intended to hide the variable name, but it does not constitute malicious activity.",
