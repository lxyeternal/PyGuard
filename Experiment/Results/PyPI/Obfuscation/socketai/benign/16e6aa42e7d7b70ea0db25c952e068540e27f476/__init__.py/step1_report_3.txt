{
  "purpose": "Assigns version information to a variable, likely for package versioning.",
  "sources": "Assignment statement, setting variables __version__ and nzHxovazNxjOWgzzTbdDswNtiATCygbj.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input, no data leakage or external communication.",
  "flows": "None, as it's a straightforward variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable name 'nzHxovazNxjOWgzzTbdDswNtiATCygbj', which appears obfuscated or randomly generated.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a string '2.0.0' to two variables: __version__ and a seemingly random variable name. There is no evidence of data input, external communication, or malicious constructs. The variable name's obfuscated nature might suggest concealment, but without further code, it does not indicate malicious behavior. The assignment itself is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code simply assigns a version string to variables, with an unusual variable name that could suggest obfuscation but is not inherently malicious. No malware or security risks are apparent from this snippet.",
