  "purpose": "Define a version string for a Python package/module",
  "sources": "Assignment to variables `nzHxovazNxjOWgzzTbdDswNtiATCygbj` and `__version__`",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform security-sensitive actions",
  "flows": "Assignment of a string value to variables; no data flow from external sources",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable name, but no malicious behavior or suspicious activity detected",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string '2.0.0' to two variables: one obfuscated variable name and the common `__version__`. This is a typical practice in Python packaging to specify version info. No input sources, data flows, or security-sensitive operations are present. The obfuscated variable name might suggest attempts at concealment, but it does not in itself indicate malicious intent. There are no sinks, external data handling, or code execution. The code appears straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code simply sets version variables, a common and harmless pattern in Python packages. No malicious activity or security risks are present.",
