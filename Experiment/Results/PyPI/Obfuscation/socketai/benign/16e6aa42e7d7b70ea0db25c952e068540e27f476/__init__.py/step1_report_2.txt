  "purpose": "Assignment of version string '2.0.0' to a variable and __version__ attribute, likely for package versioning.",
  "sources": "Literal string '2.0.0' assigned to __version__ and nzHxovazNxjOWgzzTbdDswNtiATCygbj",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows involving untrusted data, user input, or external data sources",
  "flows": "Direct assignment from string to variables, no data flow involving external sources",
  "anomalies": "Variable name nzHxovazNxjOWgzzTbdDswNtiATCygbj appears obfuscated or randomly generated, which is unusual but not inherently malicious; no other anomalies detected",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static version string to two variables, one of which is the conventional __version__ attribute. The variable name 'nzHxovazNxjOWgzzTbdDswNtiATCygbj' is unusual and appears obfuscated or randomly generated, possibly to hide purpose. There are no signs of malicious code, data leakage, or suspicious behavior. The code is minimal and straightforward, serving likely as part of a versioning scheme.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and does not contain malicious behavior. The obfuscated variable name is unusual but does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, this appears to be a benign version assignment with no security concerns.",
