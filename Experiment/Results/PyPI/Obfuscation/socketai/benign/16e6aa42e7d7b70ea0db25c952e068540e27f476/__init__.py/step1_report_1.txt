{
  "purpose": "Assigns a version string to the variable 'nzHxovazNxjOWgzzTbdDswNtiATCygbj' and the special variable '__version__' for the package.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths; the code only contains variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Use of an obfuscated variable name that appears to be randomly generated; no other unusual code behavior or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code only consists of a variable assignment where a variable with a non-descriptive, seemingly random name is set equal to '__version__' which is assigned a string '2.0.0'. This pattern is common in package version declarations. There are no inputs, no sinks, no data flows, and no signs of malicious or obfuscated behavior beyond the naming choice. The presence of the random variable name could be an attempt at obfuscation, but in isolation, it is not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple version assignment with a obfuscated variable name, which is not malicious but could be a sign of minimal obfuscation. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
