{
  "purpose": "Assigns version '2.0.0' to a variable with an obfuscated name and __version__.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; only internal variable assignment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources; no external communication or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "The source is the assignment statement; no external or untrusted data flows involved.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable name 'nzHxovazNxjOWgzzTbdDswNtiATCygbj' appears randomly generated, but no malicious activity is present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward version assignment with an obfuscated variable name. No inputs, outputs, or external interactions are present. The obfuscated name does not perform any malicious behavior or security-sensitive operation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated around 0.2-0.8, security risk near 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No evidence of malicious intent, data leakage, or security vulnerabilities is detected. The obfuscation appears superficial and stylistic rather than malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign version declaration with superficial obfuscation. There is no malicious activity or security risk. The current scoring is appropriate; no adjustments needed.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.4,
