  "conclusion": "The code snippet shows obfuscated import statements from a legitimate package ('consul') with no direct malicious activity. Obfuscation alone warrants caution but does not confirm malicious intent. The overall security risk is moderate, with low malware suspicion. Further investigation into the actual modules and surrounding code is recommended to confirm legitimacy."
