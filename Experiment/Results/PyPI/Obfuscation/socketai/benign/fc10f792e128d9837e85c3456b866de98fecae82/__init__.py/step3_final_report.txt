  "purpose": "Assessment of obfuscated import statements from the 'consul' package with minimal code context.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'consul.base' and 'consul.std' with obfuscated identifiers, and a version string assignment.",
  "sinks": "No data flows, network activity, or data handling observed; potential concern is obfuscated identifiers which could conceal malicious code.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; only import statements and a version string are present, with no further execution or data flow shown.",
  "anomalies": "Use of non-descriptive, obfuscated identifiers in import statements; absence of functional code; only a version string assigned.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only import statements with obfuscated identifiers and a version string, with no evidence of malicious activity or data flow. The obfuscation raises suspicion but is not conclusive. The scores across reports are consistent with moderate suspicion due to obfuscation, with low malware likelihood. The absence of network activity or malicious payloads suggests the risk is moderate at worst. The scores are justified, though slightly conservative adjustments could be made, but current levels appropriately reflect the cautious stance warranted by obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet shows obfuscated import statements from a legitimate package ('consul') with no direct malicious activity. Obfuscation alone warrants caution but does not confirm malicious intent. The overall security risk is moderate, with low malware suspicion. Further investigation into the actual modules and surrounding code is recommended to confirm legitimacy.",
