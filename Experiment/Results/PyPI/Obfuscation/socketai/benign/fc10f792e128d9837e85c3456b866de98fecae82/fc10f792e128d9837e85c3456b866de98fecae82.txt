      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code snippet shows obfuscated import statements from a legitimate package ('consul') with no direct malicious activity. Obfuscation alone warrants caution but does not confirm malicious intent. The overall security risk is moderate, with low malware suspicion. Further investigation into the actual modules and surrounding code is recommended to confirm legitimacy."

      "obfuscated": 0.9,
      "confidence": 0.85,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits significant obfuscation and suspicious network communication patterns, strongly indicating malicious or stealthy behavior. The non-standard 'requests' method 'dvOFWrlufXpRZMpduYpKawAztUARHLmK()' is a key red flag, suggesting obfuscation or malicious tampering. The pattern of callback-based network requests and obfuscated class/method names are typical of malware attempting to evade detection. Given these indicators, the package should be considered highly suspicious or malicious, warranting further investigation or removal."

      "obfuscated": 0.8,
      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated, complex HTTP client wrapper that, in the provided fragment, shows no evidence of malicious activity. The primary concern is the obfuscation, which could conceal malicious intent, but no concrete malicious payloads or behaviors are detected. The overall security risk is moderate due to obfuscation, but the code appears benign based on current analysis."

      "obfuscated": 0.75,
      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated and performs dynamic HTTP operations, which raises suspicion but does not provide concrete evidence of malicious activity. The low malware score is appropriate, with the high obfuscation and moderate risk scores justified by the potential for concealment and misuse. Further investigation in the broader context is recommended, but based solely on this snippet, it appears to be a complex, obfuscated wrapper with no explicit malicious intent."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, albeit obfuscated, async HTTP client for interacting with a Consul service. There is no evidence of malware or malicious activity. The high obfuscation warrants cautious monitoring, but overall, the supply chain security risk is low."
