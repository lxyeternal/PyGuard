{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class that inherits from Exception, with a constructor accepting a code, message, and optional data.",
  "sources": "The class constructor uses input parameters 'code', 'message', and 'data'. The 'data' parameter defaults to the imported 'lbphgpWWnNGxkgHrLResqnEnmEMBogvK'.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks that process untrusted data or perform malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are assigned to object attributes; no data flow from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks is observed.",
  "anomalies": "The imported 'lbphgpWWnNGxkgHrLResqnEnmEMBogvK' appears to be an obfuscated or random string, potentially indicating obfuscation or malicious intent, but there's no active malicious behavior or suspicious code functionality.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of Exception with a constructor that assigns provided arguments to instance variables. The default value for 'data' is an imported symbol with an obfuscated name, which could suggest hiding malicious intent or simply obfuscation. There are no active data flows, network operations, or other malicious behaviors present. The code is minimal and does not perform any suspicious actions on its own.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward custom exception class definition. The use of an obfuscated import name warrants cautious review of the imported module, but based solely on this snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
