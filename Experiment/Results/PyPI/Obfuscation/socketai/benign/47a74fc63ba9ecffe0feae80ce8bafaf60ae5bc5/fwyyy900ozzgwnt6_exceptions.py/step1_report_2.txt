{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class with an optional data attribute.",
  "sources": "The class constructor reads input parameters: code, message, and data (defaulting to an imported value).",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or external communication are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are assigned to object attributes; no further data flow or processing is evident.",
  "anomalies": "Use of an imported value as a default parameter; the import name appears obfuscated, which might be suspicious but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of Exception with a constructor that initializes attributes. The 'data' parameter defaults to a value imported from a module with an obfuscated name, which could be an attempt at hiding intent. No input/output or network operations are present. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious activity. The code appears to be a straightforward exception class definition, possibly using obfuscated naming to evade detection or for obscure code practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, non-malicious class definition with obfuscated naming but no evidence of malicious intent or behavior. The use of an imported value as a default parameter is unusual but not harmful per se.",
