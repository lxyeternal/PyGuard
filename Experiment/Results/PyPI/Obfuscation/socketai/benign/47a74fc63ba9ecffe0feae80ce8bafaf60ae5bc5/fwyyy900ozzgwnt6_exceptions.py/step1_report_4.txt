  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class that includes a code, message, and optional data.",
  "sources": "Input parameters in the __init__ method: code, message, data",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data directly, but the data parameter could potentially be misused if the class is instantiated with untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (code, message, data) flow into the exception object during instantiation.",
  "anomalies": "The data parameter defaults to an imported value lbphgpWWnNGxkgHrLResqnEnmEMBogvK, which appears to be an obfuscated or nonsensical identifier; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class inheriting from Exception. It imports a potentially obfuscated symbol 'lbphgpWWnNGxkgHrLResqnEnmEMBogvK' from a module. The class __init__ method assigns provided parameters to instance variables. There are no evident malicious behaviors such as code execution, network activity, or data leaks. The use of an obfuscated default value might be suspicious but does not indicate malicious intent by itself.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard custom exception class with a suspiciously obfuscated default data value. There are no clear signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
