{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class with an optional data payload.",
  "sources": "The class constructor reads parameters: code, message, data; the default value for data is imported from another module.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no untrusted data processing or output to external systems.",
  "flows": "Initialization of the exception with potentially untrusted parameters, but no data flows to external systems or sinks within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The default value for 'data' is imported from a module 'sentinels', which could be an obfuscated or external source, but no malicious activity is evident from this snippet alone. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are present. The code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of Exception with a constructor that assigns three attributes. The default value for 'data' is obtained from an import, which could be a sentinel value for other logic. There are no suspicious behaviors such as dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated code. The structure is minimal and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple custom exception class with an imported default value. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are evident within this snippet. The use of an imported sentinel could hint at more complex logic elsewhere, but this code alone is safe.",
