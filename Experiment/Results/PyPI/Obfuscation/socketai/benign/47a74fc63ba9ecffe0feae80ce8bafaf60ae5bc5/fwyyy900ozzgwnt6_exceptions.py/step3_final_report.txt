  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class with an optional data parameter defaulting to an imported sentinel value.",
  "sources": "Import from .sentinels module, specifically lbphgpWWnNGxkgHrLResqnEnmEMBogvK",
  "sinks": "None; no data leaks, network activity, or untrusted data processing present",
  "flows": "Instantiation of the exception with code, message, and optional data from sentinel import",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated import name, which could be an attempt at concealment but not inherently malicious",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, defining a custom exception with a default data value imported from an obfuscated module. No malicious code, network activity, or data exfiltration is evident. The obfuscated import name raises some suspicion but does not indicate malicious intent. The low malware and risk scores across reports are consistent with the benign nature of this snippet. The primary concern is the imported sentinel, which warrants further review to ensure it is not malicious. Overall, the code appears safe, with obfuscation being the only point of caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign custom exception class with an obfuscated import name. No malicious activity or supply chain compromise is evident from this snippet. The obfuscation warrants cautious review of the imported module, but the overall security risk remains low.",
