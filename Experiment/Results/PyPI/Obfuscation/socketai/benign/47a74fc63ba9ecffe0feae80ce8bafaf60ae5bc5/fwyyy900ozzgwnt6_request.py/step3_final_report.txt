{
  "purpose": "Defines a data structure with obfuscated class and attribute names, likely for data modeling or concealment.",
  "sources": "Class definition and attribute declarations within the code.",
  "sinks": "No data input/output, external calls, or data flows are present.",
  "flows": "None; the code only declares a data container without operational logic.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated class and attribute names; no operational code or external interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a NamedTuple with obfuscated identifiers, indicating possible code concealment but no malicious activity. No data sources, sinks, or flows are present. The obfuscation appears intentional but benign, serving as a structural data container. Scores of malware at 0 and low security risk are appropriate, with high obfuscation scores reflecting naming complexity. No evidence suggests malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated data structure with no malicious intent or operational logic. The current scores are justified and appropriate, reflecting high obfuscation but no security risks.",
