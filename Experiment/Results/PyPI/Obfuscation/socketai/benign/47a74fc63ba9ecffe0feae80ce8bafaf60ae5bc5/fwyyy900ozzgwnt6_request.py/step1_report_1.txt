{
  "purpose": "Defines a NamedTuple class with specified fields, likely for data modeling or structure definition.",
  "sources": "No data input sources or external data reads are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data could be processed or leaked are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is established in this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Contains highly obfuscated class name and attribute names which appear intentionally nonsensical; no meaningful logic or external interactions are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a NamedTuple with complex, nonsensical naming conventions, which can be an indicator of obfuscation. There are no data sources, sinks, or execution logic that could suggest malicious activity. The use of Union and Dict types is standard for flexible data structures. Overall, the code appears to be a simple, obfuscated data structure definition without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward class definition with obfuscated naming. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident. The obfuscation might be intentional to hide the code’s purpose, but it does not indicate malicious activity.",
