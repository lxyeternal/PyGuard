{
  "purpose": "Define a strongly-typed NamedTuple class with generic fields, likely for structured data storage.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; code is defining a class structure only.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data leaks; no untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only declares a class.",
  "anomalies": "The class name and attribute names appear obfuscated or randomly generated; no meaningful identifiers or comments to clarify intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a NamedTuple class with unusual, seemingly random names for the class and attributes. It uses Union types for flexibility. No functions, data processing, input handling, or output mechanisms are present. The absence of any data handling logic minimizes risk. The naming may suggest obfuscation, but no malicious behavior or malicious code execution is evident. The structure is straightforward and does not perform any operations or system interactions.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment solely defines a data structure with obfuscated identifiers and no operational logic. There is no indication of malicious intent or security risks. The unusual naming might suggest obfuscation, but it does not appear malicious or suspicious.",
