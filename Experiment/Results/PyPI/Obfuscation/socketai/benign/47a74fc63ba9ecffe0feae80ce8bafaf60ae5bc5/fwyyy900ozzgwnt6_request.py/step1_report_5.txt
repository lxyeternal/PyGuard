  "purpose": "Definition of a NamedTuple class with specified fields for structured data storage.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources; the code only defines a class structure.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points present.",
  "flows": "No data flow observed as the code only defines a class.",
  "anomalies": "Class name and attribute names are nonsensical, obscure, and do not follow conventional naming. Usage of Union and Any types without validation or context. No actual executable logic or data handling present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports typing modules and defines a NamedTuple with three fields. The class name and field names appear random and meaningless, possibly obfuscated or placeholder identifiers. No data input, output, or processing occurs. No malicious functions, network calls, or data leaks are evident. The code is purely structural without any behavior or side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward class definition with obfuscated naming but contains no malicious logic, data handling, or security concerns. It appears to serve as a data structure placeholder or part of a larger, non-visible codebase.",
