  "purpose": "Module for organizing and re-exporting functions and constants related to JSON-RPC handling, server, and result processing.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules with heavily obfuscated alias names.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or external interactions; purely import and export statements.",
  "flows": "Import aliases (sources) are assigned to module functions/classes, then re-exported via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of import aliases and module names, which is unusual and suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with non-descriptive, obfuscated aliases, and a __all__ list exposing these. No executable logic, data processing, or network activity is present. The obfuscation could be an attempt to conceal malicious behavior or proprietary code, but it could also be auto-generated or internal naming conventions. The lack of runtime behavior or external interactions limits the ability to assess malicious intent directly. The high obfuscation score (~0.8) is justified, while the malware score (~0.2) reflects suspicion but no concrete evidence of malicious activity. The overall risk (~0.3) is moderate, primarily due to obfuscation concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign in function but exhibits suspicious obfuscation. Without further context or analysis of the imported modules' contents, there is no definitive evidence of malicious behavior. The current scores are appropriate: low malware likelihood, high obfuscation suspicion, and moderate overall risk. Further investigation into the imported modules and runtime behavior is recommended before making definitive security judgments.",
