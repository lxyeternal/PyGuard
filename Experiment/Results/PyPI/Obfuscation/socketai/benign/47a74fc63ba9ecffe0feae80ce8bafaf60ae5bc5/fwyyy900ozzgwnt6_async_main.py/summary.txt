  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated wrapper functions around an external core function, with no explicit malicious activity evident. The high obfuscation warrants caution, but current evidence does not confirm malicious intent. Scores are set to reflect suspicion due to obfuscation and indirect data flow, with malware likelihood at approximately 0.3, obfuscation at 0.8, and overall security risk at 0.4. Further runtime and static analysis is advised before deployment in security-sensitive contexts."
