{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define a decorator for registering functions in a dictionary, possibly for later invocation or management.",
  "sources": "The code reads optional function input parameters and the function's __name__ attribute.",
  "sinks": "The code writes functions into a global dictionary 'spsDExymFbmnQpWsXacqLjvFXjyNRbDx'.",
  "flows": "Input function or decorator application -> registration into global dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; variable and function names are obfuscated, but this alone is not suspicious. The code performs standard decorator registration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports type hints and a specific result class, then defines a type for callables returning that class. It initializes a dictionary to store functions. The decorator function 'FvfOYIXZnzhgqZQiEfwwYOqJbatKnSDS' can be used with or without parameters, registering functions into the dictionary by name. The code structure is consistent with a registration decorator. No suspicious activity, obfuscated malicious logic, or data leakage patterns are evident. It functions as a typical registration decorator with obfuscated variable names.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a function registration decorator with obfuscated identifiers. It performs standard registration in a dictionary without any malicious behavior or security risks.",
