{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package, used to configure package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "File reading from 'README.md' (line 2). No other data input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified that process untrusted data or perform potentially harmful actions. No network, file, or environment variable interactions are evident.",
  "flows": "Read from 'README.md' file (source) to variable. No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variable names (e.g., gvDNKjxLffqMYYjXvSUNyFuyfpfCZPvz, DENYkdEZbLzNtEBchVMIaZHCfzLXHxfJ, IkbwcDOvuKrHLCLQBLvmAiqlROVKDNMS). These appear to be random strings rather than meaningful variable names. Additionally, the use of hardcoded strings that resemble base64 or encoded data (e.g., 'IkbwcDOvuKrHLCLQBLvmAiqlROVKDNMS=') suggests obfuscation or concealment.",
  "analysis": "The script loads a README file into a variable with an obscure name, then calls setup() with package metadata and configuration parameters. The presence of obfuscated variable names and seemingly random strings suggests intentional concealment or obfuscation, but there is no evidence of malicious code such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The script conforms to a typical setup configuration pattern with unusual naming but no malicious actions observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names and strings, possibly to conceal details. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation may be for proprietary reasons or to avoid casual inspection, but it does not inherently suggest malicious intent.",
