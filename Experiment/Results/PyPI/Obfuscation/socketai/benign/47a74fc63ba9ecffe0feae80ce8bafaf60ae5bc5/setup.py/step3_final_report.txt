  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package, reading README.md and defining package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file; static variables in setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or file write operations.",
  "flows": "Reading file into variable -> passing parameters to setup()",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; non-standard, suspicious keys in setup(); use of encoded strings like 'IkbwcDOvuKrHLCLQBLvmAiqlROVKDNMS=' and 'text/markdown'.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names and unusual keys, which could be an attempt to conceal malicious intent or proprietary code. No evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection is present. The obfuscation is consistent across reports and raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious activity. The malware score should be zero, as no malicious actions are observed. The obfuscation score is high (~0.7), reflecting the obfuscated variable names and keys. The security risk score should be low (~0.2), indicating caution but no active threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign setup script with obfuscation that warrants caution. There is no evidence of malware or malicious behavior, but the obfuscation suggests further review of the entire package is advisable before deployment.",
