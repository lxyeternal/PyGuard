  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, reading README.md and configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file; hardcoded strings assigned to variables; package metadata assignments.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or untrusted data outputs observed.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' -> storing content in variable; package setup configuration from hardcoded variables.",
  "anomalies": "Use of non-descriptive variable names; unusual variable assignments like 'IkbwcDOvuKrHLCLQBLvmAiqlROVKDNMS=' with a value that appears base64-like or obfuscated; unusual key names such as 'DENYkdEZbLzNtEBchVMIaZHCfzLXHxfJ'. No actual code injection or malicious network activity; however, obfuscated variables and inconsistent naming could suggest an attempt to hide intent.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a standard setup process for a Python package, reading a README file and defining package metadata. The variable names are non-descriptive and some contain seemingly random strings, which may indicate obfuscation. No external data is fetched or sent, and no suspicious code constructs are present. The use of unusual variable names and key-like strings could be benign obfuscation or an attempt to hide malicious intent. Overall, the code does not perform any malicious actions but exhibits signs of obfuscation that warrant cautious review.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names. There are no clear indicators of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks, but the obfuscation raises some suspicion. No malicious actions are evident from this fragment alone.",
