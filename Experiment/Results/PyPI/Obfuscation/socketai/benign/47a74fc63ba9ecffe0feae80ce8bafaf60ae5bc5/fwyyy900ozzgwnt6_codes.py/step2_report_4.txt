  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports describe the code as a set of constant integer definitions for JSON-RPC error codes. The original code provided matches these descriptions exactly. Since these are static constant assignments, there is no indication of issues like code injection, data leaks, or malicious behavior. Therefore, **no issues are present** in the code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their description: they correctly identify the code as standard, harmless constant definitions for error codes. They do not contain logical flaws or inaccuracies. No errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \nAll reports assign:\n- confidence: 1 (high confidence)\n- obfuscated: 0 (not obfuscated)\n- malware: 0 (no malware)\n- securityRisk: 0 (no security risk)\n\nThese scores seem reasonable given the code content. Since the code is just constant definitions, no change in scores is necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nAll reports assign a securityRisk of 0, which is appropriate. The code shows no signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities. Therefore, no justification for higher risk scores is needed.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \nAll reports assign malware: 0, which aligns with the code's nature. No malicious behavior is detected or suggested.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nThe reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as standard constants. No claims about vulnerabilities are based on unsupported assumptions.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores**  \nThe scores are consistent with the code's nature: static, harmless constant definitions.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected or implied)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risks or vulnerabilities)\n\n### Additional Comments:\nGiven the simplicity and standard nature of this code, it does not warrant any higher scores. The reports are accurate and thorough, correctly classifying the code as benign.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a typical, harmless set of constant definitions for JSON-RPC error codes. All scores are appropriate, and no further action or adjustment is necessary.",
