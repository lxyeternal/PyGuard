{
  "purpose": "Defines standard JSON-RPC error codes for handling various error scenarios in a JSON-RPC server or client implementation.",
  "sources": "No input or external data sources; all data are constant definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing occurs; no untrusted data flows are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; all definitions are static constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code consists solely of constant assignments with standard error codes.",
  "analysis": "The code declares a set of integer constants representing JSON-RPC error codes. These are standard error codes used in JSON-RPC protocols to indicate specific error conditions such as parse errors, invalid requests, method not found, invalid parameters, internal errors, and server errors. The constants are correctly assigned negative integer values as per the JSON-RPC specification. There are no dynamic code, user inputs, or external data interactions. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code simply defines a set of standard error codes for a JSON-RPC implementation. It does not contain any malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. It appears to be a normal, harmless part of a larger system's protocol handling.",
