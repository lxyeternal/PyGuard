  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code consists solely of constant integer definitions for standard JSON-RPC error codes.\n   - There are no functions, data flows, external interactions, or dynamic code.\n   - The constants match the JSON-RPC specification, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues:**\n   - None of the reports identify any actual issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior.\n   - The code appears to be a straightforward constants module, commonly used in JSON-RPC implementations.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:**\n   - No logical errors or flaws are evident.\n   - The assignments are correct and follow the standard.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate since the code is straightforward and human-readable.\n   - **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given the absence of any malicious activity or suspicious patterns.\n   - **Security Risk:** All reports assign 0, which is reasonable because the code is purely defining constants without any security implications.\n\n5. **Potential for Higher Risk Scores:**\n   - Since the code is static, well-known, and standard, there's no reason to assign higher scores for malware or obfuscation.\n   - The risk score is correctly set to 0 across all reports.\n\n6. **Any Claims Based on Assumptions?**\n   - No, all reports base their conclusions on the static and standard nature of the code.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the content and nature of the code.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected or implied)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (code is straightforward constants)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk associated with defining constants)\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard, benign set of JSON-RPC error code constants with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scoring is appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\n- Keep all scores at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n- No further action needed.\n\n**Note:** Always remain vigilant if this code is dynamically generated or integrated into larger systems, but based solely on the provided snippets and reports, it is safe.",
