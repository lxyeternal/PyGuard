  "purpose": "Defines constant error codes likely used for JSON-RPC or API error handling.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; only constant variable assignments.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external effects observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; purely constant definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists solely of integer constant assignments.",
  "analysis": "The code declares a set of integer constants representing error codes commonly used in JSON-RPC or API protocols. These are standard and well-known error codes for request parsing, invalid requests, method not found, invalid parameters, internal errors, and server errors. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data leaks, network communication, code injection, or backdoors. The code appears to be a typical constants module for error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of error code definitions with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply establishes constants for error codes used elsewhere.",
