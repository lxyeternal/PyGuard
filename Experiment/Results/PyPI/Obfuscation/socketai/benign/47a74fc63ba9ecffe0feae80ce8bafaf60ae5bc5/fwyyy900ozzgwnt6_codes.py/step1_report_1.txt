{
  "purpose": "Define standard JSON-RPC error codes for a communication protocol or API.",
  "sources": "These are constant assignments, likely used as error codes in the application.",
  "sinks": "No data flow to external systems; only constant definitions.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data or input processing involved.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns; straightforward constant assignments.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of integer constant definitions representing error codes, which are common in JSON-RPC implementations. There are no functions, data handling, or external interactions present. The structure and content are typical and do not suggest obfuscation or malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of error code constants used for API or protocol error handling. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
