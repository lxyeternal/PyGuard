  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as defining constants for JSON-RPC error codes.\n- The code is static, with no data flow, input handling, or external interactions.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- All reports assign a confidence of 1, and all scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are 0.\n\n**Step-by-step review:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code is straightforward constant definitions, matching the standard JSON-RPC error codes.\n   - No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are present.\n   - **Confirmed:** No issues or malicious code are present.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their descriptions.\n   - They correctly identify the code as standard, benign, and non-malicious.\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The risk scores are all 0, reflecting no security concern.\n   - These scores are reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n4. **Justification for higher risk scores:**\n   - Since all code is just constant definitions with no dynamic or malicious behavior, raising the risk score would be unjustified.\n   - Malware score of 0 is correct; no malicious activity is detected or implied.\n   - The obfuscated score of 0 is appropriate; no obfuscation detected.\n   - Security risk remains at 0, as the code does not pose any threat.\n\n5. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as standard error code constants.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n6. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature across all reports.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\nGiven the detailed analysis, I concur with the existing scores. The code is a benign, standard set of constant definitions for JSON-RPC error handling.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Score | Justification                                                      |\n|------------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0       | No malicious activity or code behavior present.                     |\n| Obfuscated       | 0       | Code is straightforward constant definitions, no obfuscation.     |\n| Security Risk    | 0       | No vulnerabilities, data leaks, or external threats detected.     |\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. The code poses no security risk, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated.",
