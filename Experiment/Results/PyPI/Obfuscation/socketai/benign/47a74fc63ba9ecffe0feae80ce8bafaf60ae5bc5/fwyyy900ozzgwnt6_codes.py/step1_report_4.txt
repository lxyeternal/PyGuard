  "purpose": "Defines standard JSON-RPC error codes for an API or service.",
  "sources": "No input sources; static constant assignments.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flows; only constant definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward constant assignments for error codes, typical in JSON-RPC implementations. No dynamic code, user input, or external data handling present. No obfuscation, malicious instructions, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard, non-malicious, and part of an API error code mapping. It poses no security risk.",
