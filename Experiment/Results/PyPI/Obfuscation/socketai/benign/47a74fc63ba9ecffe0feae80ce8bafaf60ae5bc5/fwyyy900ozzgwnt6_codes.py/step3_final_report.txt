  "purpose": "Define standard JSON-RPC error codes as constants for error handling.",
  "sources": "Static constant definitions for error codes; no data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; code does not process untrusted input or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; constants are used as static references.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of constant integer definitions aligning with JSON-RPC specifications. No dynamic behavior, external interactions, or data processing are present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the static, standard nature of the code. No issues or anomalies are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of error code constants used in JSON-RPC implementations. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The current assessment and scores are appropriate and justified.",
