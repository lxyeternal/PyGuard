  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as a set of constant integer definitions for JSON-RPC error codes.\n- The code is static, with no data processing, external interactions, or dynamic behavior.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious indicators are detected in any report.\n- The scores assigned to malware and security risk are all zero, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Evaluations:\n\n**1. Presence of issues in the code:**\n\n- The code contains only constant definitions; no issues or vulnerabilities are present.\n- No data flow, no external data, no dynamic code, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues are present.\n\n**2. Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their reasoning.\n- They correctly identify the code as standard, benign, and typical for JSON-RPC error handling.\n- No logical flaws or mistakes detected.\n\n**3. Scores given to each issue:**\n\n- All reports assign `malware: 0` and `securityRisk: 0`.\n- These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**4. Justification for higher risk scores:**\n\n- Since the code is only constant definitions with no dynamic or malicious behavior, a risk score higher than 0.5 would be unjustified.\n- The assigned scores are appropriate.\n\n**5. Malware score considerations:**\n\n- No malicious activity, such as code injection, backdoors, or data leaks, is indicated.\n- Scores of 0 are justified.\n\n**6. Claims based on assumptions:**\n\n- The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as standard constants.\n- No false positives or unwarranted concerns.\n\n**7. Consistency of scores with the reports:**\n\n- The scores are consistent and justified based on the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Code correctness:** No issues or vulnerabilities.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese are appropriate given the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:** The code is a straightforward, standard set of error code constants used in JSON-RPC implementations. It poses no security risks or malicious concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** All reports are accurate and reasonable. No changes or escalations are necessary.",
