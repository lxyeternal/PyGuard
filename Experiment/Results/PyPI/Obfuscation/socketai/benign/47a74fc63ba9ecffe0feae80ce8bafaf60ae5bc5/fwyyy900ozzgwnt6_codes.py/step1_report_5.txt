  "purpose": "Define standard JSON-RPC error codes for handling different types of errors in a JSON-RPC server implementation.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading; error code definitions are static constants.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing or output affecting external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data paths present.",
  "anomalies": "Code consists solely of constant error code definitions with no dynamic or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code declares a set of constant error codes used in JSON-RPC communication, representing various error conditions. There are no input handling, data processing, or external interactions. No logic, control flow, or potentially malicious constructs are present. The code appears to be standard, static definitions without obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely defines error code constants for JSON-RPC protocol, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is standard and benign.",
