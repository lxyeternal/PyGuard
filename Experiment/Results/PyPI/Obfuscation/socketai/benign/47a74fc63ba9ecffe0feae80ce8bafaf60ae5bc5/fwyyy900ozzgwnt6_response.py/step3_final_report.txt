  "purpose": "Utility functions for creating JSON-RPC response objects, including error and success responses, with obfuscated variable names and sentinel value usage.",
  "sources": "Input data passed into functions, including error data, response data, and identifiers.",
  "sinks": "Generated response dictionaries intended for network transmission or API responses.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through functions that format responses, utilizing sentinel objects and type checks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and class names, use of a sentinel object `lbphgpWWnNGxkgHrLResqnEnmEMBogvK` for optional data, no network or system activity, no secrets or code injection.",
  "analysis": "The code defines response formatting functions for JSON-RPC, with obfuscation likely for concealment or minimization. No malicious activity such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code injection is present. The sentinel object is used to conditionally include data in error responses. Obfuscation raises suspicion but does not indicate malicious intent. The malware score is appropriately zero; the obfuscation score is moderate; the risk score is low, reflecting utility nature without active vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for JSON-RPC response handling, with obfuscation that warrants caution but does not constitute malicious behavior. No evidence of supply chain sabotage or malicious payloads is found.",
