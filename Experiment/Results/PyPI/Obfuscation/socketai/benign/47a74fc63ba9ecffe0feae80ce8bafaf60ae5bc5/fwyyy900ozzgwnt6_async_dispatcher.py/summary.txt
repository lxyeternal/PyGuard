  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated and complex, which could be used to conceal malicious behavior, but static analysis shows no evidence of malicious payloads or supply chain sabotage. The low malware score (~0.2) and moderate risk (~0.3) are appropriate. Continuous runtime monitoring and dynamic analysis are recommended to confirm benign intent."
