  "security_risk": 0.4,
  "obfuscated": 0.8,
  "confidence": 0.75,
  "conclusion": "The code itself appears benign but is suspicious due to obfuscation and reliance on an unknown external function. No direct malicious activity is present, but the potential for malicious behavior exists if the external function is malicious. Scores are appropriately cautious, emphasizing the need for further investigation into the external dependency."
