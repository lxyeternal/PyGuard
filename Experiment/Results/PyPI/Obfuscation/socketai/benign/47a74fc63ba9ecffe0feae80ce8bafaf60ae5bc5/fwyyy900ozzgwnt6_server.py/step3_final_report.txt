  "purpose": "A minimal HTTP server that reads request data, passes it to an external obfuscated function, and returns the function's output.",

  "flows": "Request data -> external function -> HTTP response",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and function names, no input validation, external dependency with unknown behavior",
  "analysis": "The code implements a straightforward server that reads request data based on Content-Length, decodes it, and passes it to an external, obfuscated function, then responds with its output. The obfuscation and lack of validation are suspicious but not inherently malicious. The external function's behavior is unknown, representing a significant risk factor. No direct malicious actions are evident within this snippet. The high obfuscation score reflects concealment intent, and the moderate malware and risk scores are justified given the uncertainty.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself appears benign but is suspicious due to obfuscation and reliance on an unknown external function. No direct malicious activity is present, but the potential for malicious behavior exists if the external function is malicious. Scores are appropriately cautious, emphasizing the need for further investigation into the external dependency.",
