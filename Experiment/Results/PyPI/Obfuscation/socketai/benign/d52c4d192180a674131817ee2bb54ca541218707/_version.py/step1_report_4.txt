  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Use of non-descriptive variable names; no clear malicious intent or suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two variable assignments: one assigning a version string '0.2.0' and another assigning a tuple (0, 2, 0). There are no functions, no external input, no data processing, and no suspicious behavior. The variables could represent version info or metadata, which is common and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be simple metadata definitions with no malicious or security-threatening behavior. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
