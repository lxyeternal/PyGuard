{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define version information or configuration parameters, possibly for a package or module.",
  "sources": "The code reads or assigns static string and tuple values assigned to variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, external inputs, or sensitive sinks are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; variables are assigned static values only.",
  "anomalies": "The variables are named with seemingly random or non-descriptive identifiers; no clear purpose is evident. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a string '0.2.0' to a variable with a non-descriptive name and a tuple (0, 2, 0) to another similarly non-descriptive variable. No functions, external data reads, or malicious constructs are present. The code appears to be configuration or version info with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code consists of straightforward variable assignments with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears benign, likely used for versioning or configuration purposes.",
