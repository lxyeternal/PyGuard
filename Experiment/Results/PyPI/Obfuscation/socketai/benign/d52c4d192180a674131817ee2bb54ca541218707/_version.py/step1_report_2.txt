{
  "purpose": "Assign version string and version tuple variables, likely for package versioning.",
  "sources": "Variable assignments at the beginning of the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flow leading to external effects.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flows or source-to-sink paths are evident.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated-looking variable names that appear random and do not convey meaningful context; no other suspicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a version string to one variable and a version tuple to another. Both variables are hardcoded with static values. There are no inputs, no data processing, no external communications, and no dynamic code execution. The variable names are non-descriptive, which could be considered an anomaly, but do not imply malicious intent. No malicious behaviors, backdoors, or security risks are apparent from these lines.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be harmless, serving only to define version information with obfuscated variable names. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks.",
