  "purpose": "Assignment of version information to variables, likely for package metadata.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string and tuple assignments",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data outputs observed",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names that resemble encoded or obfuscated data, but no active obfuscation or malicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to one variable and a tuple with version components to another. There are no functions, no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior. Variable names appear arbitrary but do not indicate malicious intent. No use of external inputs, secrets, or dangerous functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be simple metadata assignments with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
