  "purpose": "Define version information for a package or module.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of version string and version tuple to variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, no data leaks, no external effects.",
  "flows": "Direct assignment from static values to variables; no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "Obscure variable names, but no malicious or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns static version information to variables with non-descriptive names. There are no external inputs, dynamic code, or data flows. The variable names are obscure but do not indicate malicious intent. No evidence of obfuscation beyond naming, nor any malicious activity such as network communication, data theft, or code injection. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0, obfuscated 0.2-0.8, security risk 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The overall assessment is that this is a simple, static version assignment with minimal obfuscation, posing no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a version info assignment with obfuscated variable names. There is no malicious behavior or security risk present. The scores and reasoning in the reports are justified and consistent with the code's simplicity.",
