  "purpose": "Define version information using variables, possibly for a package or module.",

  "sinks": "No untrusted input or data flows identified.",
  "flows": "Variable assignments without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of non-descriptive variable names; no immediate anomalies observed. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string and a tuple representing version components to variables with obscure names. There are no external inputs, no data leaks, or suspicious behaviors. The code appears to be a simple version definition snippet, typical in Python projects. No evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The variable names do not suggest malicious intent but are non-standard and obscure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign snippet defining version information with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a straightforward assignment with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
