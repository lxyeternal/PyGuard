  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated plugin/hook management utility with no evidence of malware or malicious activity. The primary concern is the obfuscation and dynamic attribute handling, which could be exploited if misused. Scores reflect low malware risk (0), high obfuscation (0.8), and low to moderate security risk (0.2-0.3). Overall, it appears benign but warrants cautious validation if integrated into larger systems."
