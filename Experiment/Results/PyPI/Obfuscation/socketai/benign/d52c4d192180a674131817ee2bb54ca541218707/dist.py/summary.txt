  "conclusion": "The code is a package metadata inspection utility with superficial obfuscation. No signs of malicious activity or supply chain attack are present. The current low malware and risk scores are appropriate, but the obfuscation suggests a need for cautious review if used in security-sensitive contexts. Overall, it appears benign and safe for use."
