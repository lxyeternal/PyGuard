  "conclusion": "The code is a complex, obfuscated plugin management utility with no direct evidence of malicious activity. It poses low malware risk but has moderate obfuscation and potential for info leakage through exception details. No active threats are evident, but obfuscation and dynamic invocation should be monitored in deployment."
