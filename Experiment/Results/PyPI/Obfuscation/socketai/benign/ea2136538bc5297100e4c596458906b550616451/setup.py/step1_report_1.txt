  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, specifying metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file; defining setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks identified; no network or data leak operations.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md -> setting up package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variable names (e.g., BeHqNyduoikwziecIuSUFYxmTNPywYot, JNxoOLXAAylyxrEwefpQXYriEntiyYex, EsdItNMzNFzXsMmAFDXZccevkDddLeyS). Usage of string comparisons like '>=3.6' with variable assignment appears inconsistent. No actual code execution or network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names and inconsistent parameter assignments. The obfuscation suggests an attempt to hide intent or simply poor coding style. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network calls, data exfiltration, or code injection. The version check 'EsdItNMzNFzXsMmAFDXZccevkDddLeyS' appears malformed, but without execution, it doesn't pose an immediate threat. Overall, the script appears to be a benign setup configuration with obfuscation possibly aimed at hiding the true nature of variable assignments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with obfuscated variable names and no evidence of malicious activity. The obfuscation alone does not imply malicious intent but warrants caution due to unclear variable purpose. Overall, low risk but slightly suspicious due to obfuscation.",
