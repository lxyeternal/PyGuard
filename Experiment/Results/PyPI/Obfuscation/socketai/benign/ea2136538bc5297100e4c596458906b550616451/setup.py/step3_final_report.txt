{
  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script using setuptools with obfuscated variable names and a malformed version requirement.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' into a variable; assigning package metadata and dependencies; obfuscated variable assignments.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network calls, code execution, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Reading file -> assigning to obfuscated variable -> passing variables to setup()",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; malformed 'python_requires' string (' >=3.6'); potential setup failure due to syntax error.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with obfuscated variable names, which could be an attempt to conceal malicious intent or poor coding style. No network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration is evident. The malformed version string (' >=3.6') is a syntax issue that could cause setup errors but is not malicious. The dependencies are standard packages. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not directly indicate malicious behavior. The malware scores are appropriately low (0 or 0.1), reflecting no evidence of malicious activity. The obfuscation score is high (~0.7), consistent with the variable naming. The overall security risk is low (~0.3), but the obfuscation warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with high obfuscation and a syntax flaw in the version requirement. No malicious activity is detected. The obfuscation suggests potential concealment but does not confirm malicious intent. The primary concern is the malformed version string, which should be corrected to prevent setup failures. Overall, the code poses low security risk but should be reviewed further if part of a larger package with suspicious behavior.",
