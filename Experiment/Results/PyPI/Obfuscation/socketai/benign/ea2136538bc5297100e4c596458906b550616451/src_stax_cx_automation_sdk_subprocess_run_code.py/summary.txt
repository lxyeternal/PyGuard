  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential due to dynamic code execution, untrusted data deserialization via pickle, and environment manipulation. It can be exploited for remote code execution, data exfiltration, or installing malicious dependencies. The scores assigned in the reports are justified; considering the overall risk, a slight upward adjustment of the malware score to 0.8 and risk score to 0.85 is appropriate."
