  "purpose": "The code appears to implement a basic utility or module, but without further context or comments, the specific purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly evident; no user input, environment variables, or file reads are directly visible in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include network connections, file writes, or subprocess calls if present, but none are clearly visible in this code.",
  "flows": "No clear data flow from input sources to sensitive sinks is observable in the provided code.",
  "anomalies": "There are no obvious anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs in this code fragment. The code uses standard Python syntax and library functions.",
  "analysis": "A thorough review shows the code lacks any complex logic, external input handling, or suspicious operations. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are evident. The absence of network activity, file access, or command execution reduces suspicion. The code's structure appears straightforward, with no obfuscation or unusual language features. Overall, the code looks benign but provides limited context for a complete security assessment.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears safe, with no suspicious activities or security flaws evident.",
