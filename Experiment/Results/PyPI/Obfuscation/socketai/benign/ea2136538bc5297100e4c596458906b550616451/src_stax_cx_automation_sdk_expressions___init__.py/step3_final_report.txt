  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "No explicit input sources identified; code reads environment variables, configs, user input, or strings.",
  "sinks": "Potential network connections, file operations, logs, or command executions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (environment, input) to sinks (network, files, commands).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected; missing or minimal code in some reports limits analysis.",
  "analysis": "All reports consistently indicate no evidence of malicious activity, with malware scores at 0 and obfuscation scores at 0. The security risk scores are low (0.1–0.2), justified by the benign descriptions and lack of suspicious patterns. Confidence levels vary based on code completeness, but overall assessments are reasonable. Missing code snippets in some reports lead to cautious low-confidence scores, but do not suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk scores are appropriate, and the malware scores of 0 are justified. No adjustments are necessary; the assessments are consistent with the evidence.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0,
