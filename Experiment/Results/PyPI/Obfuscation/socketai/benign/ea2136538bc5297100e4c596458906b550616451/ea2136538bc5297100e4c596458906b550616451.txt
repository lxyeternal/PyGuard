      "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with high obfuscation and a syntax flaw in the version requirement. No malicious activity is detected. The obfuscation suggests potential concealment but does not confirm malicious intent. The primary concern is the malformed version string, which should be corrected to prevent setup failures. Overall, the code poses low security risk but should be reviewed further if part of a larger package with suspicious behavior."

      "conclusion": "The code does not currently contain active malicious payloads but exhibits red flags such as obfuscation, dynamic header modification, and incomplete context. These traits could be exploited for malicious purposes if misused. The overall security risk is moderate, and the malware likelihood remains low. The obfuscation and flexible configuration justify cautious handling and further review of the complete code context."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate cloud event-driven task handler with obfuscated variable names. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration are evident. The main concern is the obfuscation level and reliance on external API functions, which should be audited. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is moderate (around 0.6), and the security risk is low (0.2). Continued review of external dependencies and message validation is recommended, but no immediate threat is identified."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential due to dynamic code execution, untrusted data deserialization via pickle, and environment manipulation. It can be exploited for remote code execution, data exfiltration, or installing malicious dependencies. The scores assigned in the reports are justified; considering the overall risk, a slight upward adjustment of the malware score to 0.8 and risk score to 0.85 is appropriate."
