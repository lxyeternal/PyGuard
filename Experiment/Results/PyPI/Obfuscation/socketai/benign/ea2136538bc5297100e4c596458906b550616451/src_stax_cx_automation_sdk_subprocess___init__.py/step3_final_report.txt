{
  "purpose": "The code performs basic data processing and system interactions such as reading environment variables, command-line arguments, and network operations, with no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, command-line arguments, network responses, and possibly dynamic imports.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data via print statements, network sockets, or file writes; no untrusted data flows leading to data leaks or system compromise.",
  "flows": "Sources (environment variables, args, network data) to sinks (output functions, network connections), but no malicious or suspicious data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic imports and network activity in some snippets could be suspicious but are not definitive indicators of malicious behavior; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets across all reports are straightforward, with no signs of malicious payloads, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. Dynamic imports and network activity in Report 2 are noted but do not constitute malicious behavior without further evidence. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign analysis. Confidence levels are high, given the simplicity and clarity of the code. Overall, the code is deemed safe with minimal security concern.",
  "conclusion": "All reports accurately assess the code as benign, with no malware or obfuscation detected. The low security risk scores are justified, and no further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.2,
