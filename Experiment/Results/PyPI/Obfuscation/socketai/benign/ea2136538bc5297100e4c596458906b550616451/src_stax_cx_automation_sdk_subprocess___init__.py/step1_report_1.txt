{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform a mathematical calculation and print the result. It does not seem to have a specific security-related purpose.",
  "sources": "No explicit input or data reading functions are present; the code operates on hardcoded values.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs data via print(), which is generally benign but could be exploited if combined with other code to reveal sensitive info.",
  "flows": "Data flows from hardcoded variables through calculations to output, with no external input or untrusted data involved.",
  "anomalies": "The code is very simple, with no suspicious or unusual constructs, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated elements. No backdoors or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of basic arithmetic operations on fixed values, with no user input, network activity, file manipulation, or environment variable access. It does not include any code injection, external data fetching, or obfuscated code segments. The structure is straightforward and lacks any suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing simple calculations with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and does not pose a threat.",
