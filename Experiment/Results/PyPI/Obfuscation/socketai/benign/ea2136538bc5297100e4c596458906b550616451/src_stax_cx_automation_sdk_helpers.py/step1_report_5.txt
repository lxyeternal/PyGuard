{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to search and manipulate a list of dictionaries based on key-value pairs, likely for processing structured data such as form fields or JSON objects.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the 'fields' list of dictionaries; no external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "Data is returned directly; no external outputs or untrusted data sinks are evident. No network or file I/O present.",
  "flows": "Input 'fields' are iterated over; matching conditions lead to return values or modifications within functions, with no complex flow or external effects.",
  "anomalies": "The functions are straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious backdoors. The code appears standard and clean.",
  "analysis": "All functions perform simple searches within a list of dictionaries based on provided keys and values. They do not execute untrusted code, connect to external services, or manipulate data in insecure ways. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are present. The functions' naming is obscure but does not indicate malicious intent; it may be auto-generated or intentionally obfuscated in naming. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with low likelihood of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of benign data processing utility functions with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is straightforward, with no suspicious or malicious patterns.",
