  "purpose": "Utility functions for processing a list of dictionaries to retrieve values, entire dicts, or indices based on key-value matching, with minor Unicode normalization.",
  "sources": "Reading input data from a list of dicts; accessing 'key' and 'value' fields within each dict.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; functions only perform data lookups and return results.",
  "flows": "Input list of dicts (source) -> search/filter operations -> return value/dict/list/index (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Function names are obscure and auto-generated-looking; no malicious patterns or obfuscation beyond naming.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward data filtering operations without side effects, network activity, or code execution. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The functions are simple and safe, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior. The obscure naming does not imply malicious obfuscation but may be auto-generated. Overall, the code is benign utility code with minimal security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of benign, straightforward utility functions for data extraction and filtering. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0.1-0.2, securityRisk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
