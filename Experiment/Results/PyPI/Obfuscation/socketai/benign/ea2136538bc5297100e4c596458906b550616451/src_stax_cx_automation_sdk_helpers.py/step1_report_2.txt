{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be utility functions for processing lists of dictionaries, likely for configuration or data parsing purposes.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'fields' (list of dicts), 'key', and 'value' strings. These are data inputs for the functions.",
  "sinks": "Return statements providing specific data from the inputs. No direct data sinks like network or file output are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through conditional logic and iteration, resulting in filtered or specific data extraction.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data handling observed. All functions perform standard data filtering and retrieval.",
  "analysis": "The functions implement straightforward search and filter logic over lists of dictionaries, matching keys and values, with no indication of malicious intent. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, such as network access, file manipulation, or obfuscated code, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard utility code for data processing with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. It appears safe and legitimate.",
