  "purpose": "Establish a connection to a MongoDB database using environment variables for URI and database name.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'DB_URI' and 'DB_NAME' accessed via getenv.",
  "sinks": "MongoClient constructor which creates a database connection using the provided URI.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read, then their values are used to instantiate MongoClient and access the database.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials; code uses environment variables, which is standard practice. The variable name 'UXehkHDMBtJralMRxxsxrCZWCdJOfZfI' is unusual and obfuscated, but not malicious. No suspicious or malicious code patterns identified.",
  "analysis": "The code imports MongoClient and getenv, then creates a database connection using environment variables for configuration. The variable name is non-descriptive and appears obfuscated, which may raise suspicion but does not necessarily indicate malicious intent. The code performs standard database connection setup without any suspicious behavior or malicious actions. No data leaks, backdoors, or malicious payloads are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code simply establishes a MongoDB connection using environment variables, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The obfuscated variable name does not indicate malicious behavior but might suggest deliberate concealment or non-standard coding style.",
