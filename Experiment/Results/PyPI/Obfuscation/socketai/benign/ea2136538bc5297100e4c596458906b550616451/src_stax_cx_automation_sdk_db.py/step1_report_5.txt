  "purpose": "Connects to a MongoDB database using credentials and configuration from environment variables.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables 'DB_URI' and 'DB_NAME' to obtain database connection details.",
  "sinks": "Uses the retrieved environment variables to establish a database connection via pymongo.MongoClient.",
  "flows": "Environment variables 'DB_URI' and 'DB_NAME' are sourced and directly used to connect to the database; no further data processing is shown.",
  "anomalies": "Variable name 'UXehkHDMBtJralMRxxsxrCZWCdJOfZfI' is obfuscated, but it is simply used as a database handle; no suspicious or unusual code constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports MongoClient and getenv, then creates a database connection using environment variables. The variable name is obfuscated but does not affect functionality. No hardcoded credentials or sensitive data are present. The code's behavior is straightforward and standard for database connection setup. There are no signs of malicious actions such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical database connection setup using environment variables, with no evidence of malicious intent or security issues. The obfuscated variable name does not indicate malicious behavior. Overall, this is a standard, safe implementation for connecting to a MongoDB database.",
