  "sinks": "MongoClient connection establishment, database retrieval",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> getenv() -> MongoClient() -> get_database()",
  "anomalies": "Use of an obfuscated variable name for the database connection object",
  "analysis": "The code imports MongoClient and getenv, then creates a database connection using environment variables. The variable name is obfuscated but does not affect functionality. No hardcoded credentials, data leaks, or malicious code are present. The code is standard for database connection setup, with no signs of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities. The obfuscated variable name is suspicious but not malicious. Scores reflect benign intent, with malware score at 0, low security risk, and moderate obfuscation suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign database connection snippet with obfuscated variable naming. No evidence of malicious activity or security issues. The obfuscation is minor and does not imply malicious intent.",
