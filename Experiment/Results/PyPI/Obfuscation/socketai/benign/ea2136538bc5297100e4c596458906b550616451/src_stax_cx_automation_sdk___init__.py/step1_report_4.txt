{
  "purpose": "Import statements for modules and functions, likely part of a larger package or module.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.wrapper and .api), specifically importing functions and classes with obfuscated names.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling present in these import statements.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink within these import statements; no executable code or data processing shown.",
  "anomalies": "The imported identifiers are highly obfuscated, consisting of random-looking strings, which is suspicious and could be an attempt to hide malicious intent. No documentation or comments are provided.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only import statements from local modules with obfuscated names, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. The lack of context or additional code prevents definitive conclusions. Obfuscated identifiers could be benign or could be used to hide malicious code or backdoors. No code execution, data handling, or network activity is present within these snippets.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists solely of obfuscated import statements, which on its own does not indicate malicious behavior but warrants caution. Without further context or additional code, it is difficult to determine malicious intent conclusively.",
