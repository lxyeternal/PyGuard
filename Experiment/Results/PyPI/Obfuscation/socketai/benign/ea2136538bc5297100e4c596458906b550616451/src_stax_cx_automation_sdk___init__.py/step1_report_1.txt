  "purpose": "The code imports specific functions and classes from local modules 'wrapper' and 'api'.",
  "sources": "Imports from .wrapper and .api modules.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network, file, or system calls are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow identifiable within this fragment.",
  "anomalies": "Imported names appear as random strings, which could be an obfuscation attempt. No obvious malicious behavior or hardcoded secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules, with no execution or data processing shown. The imported identifiers are non-descriptive, which is suspicious but not inherently malicious. No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious data handling within this snippet. The lack of context makes a comprehensive assessment impossible, but based on this fragment alone, there are no malicious behaviors or security issues detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be standard import statements with obfuscated function/class names. No malicious activity or security risks are evident from this limited fragment.",
