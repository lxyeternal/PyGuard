  "conclusion": "The code does not currently contain active malicious payloads but exhibits red flags such as obfuscation, dynamic header modification, and incomplete context. These traits could be exploited for malicious purposes if misused. The overall security risk is moderate, and the malware likelihood remains low. The obfuscation and flexible configuration justify cautious handling and further review of the complete code context."
