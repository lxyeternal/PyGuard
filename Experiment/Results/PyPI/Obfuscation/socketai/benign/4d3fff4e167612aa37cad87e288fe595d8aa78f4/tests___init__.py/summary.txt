  "obfuscated": 0.75,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "Report 1 indicates high malicious potential with strong obfuscation and dynamic execution signs, warranting a malware score of 0.9. Reports 2 and 3 are benign, with scores near zero. Report 4 shows moderate suspicion, with a malware score around 0.45. Report 5 is benign. Overall, the scores align with the behaviors described, with the highest risk in Report 1 and moderate concern in Report 4. Adjustments to reflect the evidence suggest malware scores of approximately 0.9 for Report 1, 0.45 for Report 4, and near zero for others, with obfuscation scores of 0.8 for Report 1, 0.2 for Report 4, and 0 for the rest. Security risk scores follow similarly, emphasizing high risk in Report 1 and moderate in Report 4."
