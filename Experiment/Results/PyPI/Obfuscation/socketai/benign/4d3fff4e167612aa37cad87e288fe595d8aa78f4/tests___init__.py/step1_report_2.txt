  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a Python script or module intended for some form of data processing, system interaction, or utility function. Specific details are unclear without the actual code content.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are not explicitly visible; common sources in Python scripts include user input functions (input()), file reads, environment variables, network requests, or command-line arguments. Without code, unable to identify precise sources.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include network connections, file writes, subprocess calls, eval or exec statements, or system commands, which could lead to data leaks or code execution vulnerabilities. No specific sinks can be identified without code content.",
  "flows": "Source-to-sink flows typically involve untrusted data flowing from input sources to dangerous functions or network calls. Due to lack of code, specific flows cannot be determined.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscation, or unusual code constructs are identifiable without the actual code. The prompt lacks visible code to analyze.",
  "analysis": "Insufficient code provided to perform a detailed analysis. Normally, this step would involve examining input points, data transformations, and sensitive operations to identify malicious patterns or vulnerabilities. No such data is present.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of provided code, no definitive conclusion about malicious behavior or security risks can be made. The analysis cannot proceed without code content.",
