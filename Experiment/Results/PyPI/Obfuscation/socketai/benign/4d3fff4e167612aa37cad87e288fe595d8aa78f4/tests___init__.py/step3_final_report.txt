  "purpose": "Analyze open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code injection, data leakage, insecure practices, and obfuscation.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, file reads, network connections, dynamic code execution (eval, exec), input functions.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission, system commands, file writes, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or untrusted inputs flow into dynamic execution or network activity, potentially leading to data exfiltration or system compromise.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated imports, decoding routines, use of eval/exec, hardcoded URLs or suspicious modules, inconsistent or incomplete code, unusual variable naming.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits behaviors such as obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and network activity, which are typical indicators of malicious intent. Hardcoded URLs or suspicious modules further raise concern. Lack of code or benign patterns suggest low risk. Suspicious patterns are proportionate to the potential threat, with high confidence in malicious indicators in Report 1, moderate suspicion in Report 4, and benign assessments in Reports 2, 3, and 5. Scores are consistent with these observations, with slight adjustments recommended for clarity and accuracy.",
  "conclusion": "Report 1 indicates high malicious potential with strong obfuscation and dynamic execution signs, warranting a malware score of 0.9. Reports 2 and 3 are benign, with scores near zero. Report 4 shows moderate suspicion, with a malware score around 0.45. Report 5 is benign. Overall, the scores align with the behaviors described, with the highest risk in Report 1 and moderate concern in Report 4. Adjustments to reflect the evidence suggest malware scores of approximately 0.9 for Report 1, 0.45 for Report 4, and near zero for others, with obfuscation scores of 0.8 for Report 1, 0.2 for Report 4, and 0 for the rest. Security risk scores follow similarly, emphasizing high risk in Report 1 and moderate in Report 4.",
