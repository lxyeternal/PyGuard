{
  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the pyzerproc Python module, configuring dependencies, metadata, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading README file, importing modules from pyzerproc, defining dependencies and setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; the script primarily configures package metadata.",
  "flows": "Imports from pyzerproc (obfuscated) potentially lead to side effects during module import; no other data flows observed.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated import statements and variable names; imported modules are not used elsewhere, which is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py with obfuscated import statements from pyzerproc, which could be used to hide malicious modules or behavior. No malicious actions are directly visible; the obfuscation raises suspicion. The scores assigned in reports (malware ~0.2, obfuscated ~0.8, risk ~0.3-0.4) are consistent with the evidence. Further inspection of the actual pyzerproc modules is recommended to confirm safety.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script appears benign but employs obfuscation techniques that warrant caution. No direct malicious activity is evident, but the obfuscated imports should be reviewed to rule out hidden malicious code.",
