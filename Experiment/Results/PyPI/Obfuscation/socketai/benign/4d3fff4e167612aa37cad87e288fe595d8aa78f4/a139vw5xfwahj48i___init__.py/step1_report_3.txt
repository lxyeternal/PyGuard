{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that imports specific functions and exceptions from other modules and defines some string variables, possibly for configuration or identification.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.discovery, .light, .exceptions) and variable assignments of strings containing personal and version information.",
  "sinks": "Variables assigned with personal email and a version number; no sinks involving data transmission, database access, or external system interaction are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; import statements do not involve data flow, and variable assignments are hardcoded.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials (besides a public email), suspicious imports, or obfuscated code are present. The email and version string are static and not used dynamically.",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions and exceptions from other modules, which is standard practice. The variables contain hardcoded strings: a name, an email address, and a version number, which are typical for configuration or metadata. There are no suspicious behaviors like network connections, data exfiltration, or malicious logic. No obfuscation, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It mainly performs imports and assigns static data, with no active or suspicious behavior.",
