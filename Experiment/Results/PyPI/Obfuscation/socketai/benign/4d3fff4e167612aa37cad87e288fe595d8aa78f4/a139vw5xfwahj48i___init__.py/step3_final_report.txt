{
  "purpose": "Static import statements and metadata variables, likely configuration or informational data.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.discovery, .light, .exceptions); static string variables for name, email, and version.",
  "sinks": "No data flows or untrusted input handling; no sinks identified.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow; static variables are assigned but not used in a way that leads to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names and static contact info; no suspicious code or behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and static variable definitions containing contact info and versioning. No dynamic code, network activity, or input processing is present. Variable names are obscure but do not execute malicious behavior. The absence of code execution, network activity, or data manipulation indicates a benign purpose. The obfuscated-looking variable names could be for concealment but do not constitute malicious intent. The static data and imports are typical in configuration or metadata files, with no signs of malicious payloads or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as configuration or metadata with no malicious or security risks. The static variables and imports do not exhibit malicious behavior, and no suspicious activity is detected. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation is minimal, and overall security risk is negligible.",
