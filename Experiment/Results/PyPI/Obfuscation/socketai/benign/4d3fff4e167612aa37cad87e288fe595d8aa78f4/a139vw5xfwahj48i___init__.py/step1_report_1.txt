{
  "purpose": "The code appears to import specific functions or variables from local modules and defines some string variables, likely related to contact information and versioning.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.discovery, .light, .exceptions); string variables assigned within the file.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks such as network connections, file writes, or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow evident; variables are statically assigned, and imports do not process untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials are benign contact info, no obfuscated code or suspicious constructs. Import statements are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements from local modules and static variable definitions. No external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution present. The variables appear to store contact info and version number, which are common in project metadata. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious payloads identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It mainly handles module imports and static data assignments. No suspicious activity detected.",
