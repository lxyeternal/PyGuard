  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scoring rationale.\n\n**Code Overview:**\n- Imports from local modules (.discovery, .light, .exceptions)\n- Static variable definitions: a name, email, and version string\n- No dynamic code, network activity, or input processing\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n**Summary:**\n- No suspicious activity; straightforward imports and static data\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Malware: 0\n- Risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The reasoning is sound; the code is benign.\n- Scores are appropriate; no malware or obfuscation detected.\n- **No changes needed.**\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n**Summary:**\n- Slightly obfuscated variable names\n- No malicious activity observed\n- Confidence: 0.6\n- Obfuscated: 0.7\n- Malware: 0\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Obfuscation is minimal; variable names are non-descriptive but not malicious.\n- The report suggests a cautious approach but correctly identifies benign behavior.\n- The malware score remains 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Scores are reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n**Summary:**\n- Similar to previous; static imports and variables\n- Contains contact info and version\n- No suspicious activity\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Malware: 0\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The reasoning is consistent.\n- The data appears to be configuration or metadata.\n- No issues with the scoring.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n**Summary:**\n- Obfuscated-like variable names\n- No malicious activity\n- Static data\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Obfuscated: 0.2\n- Malware: 0\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The obfuscation score is slightly higher, but no malicious activity is indicated.\n- The analysis correctly notes the benign nature.\n- Scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n**Summary:**\n- Obfuscated variable names\n- Static import and variable assignment\n- No suspicious activity\n- Confidence: 0.8\n- Obfuscated: 0.6\n- Malware: 0\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The obfuscation score is higher, but no malicious behavior is evident.\n- The reasoning is consistent.\n- Malware score remains 0, which is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which aligns with the static, benign nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** Slightly variable but generally low to moderate, reflecting the non-descriptive variable names.\n- **Risk scores:** All are very low or zero, consistent with the absence of active malicious behavior.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores across all reports are reasonable given the code context.\n- No evidence suggests the need to increase malware or risk scores.\n- The obfuscation scores are acceptable, considering variable naming conventions.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 across the board, as no malicious activity or payloads are present.\n- **Obfuscated:** Around 0.2–0.3, considering the variable names are non-descriptive but not heavily obfuscated.\n- **Risk:** Very low, around 0.1–0.2, reflecting the benign static data and imports.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports' assessments are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary. The code appears to be simple configuration or metadata code with no malicious intent.",
