{
  "purpose": "Import specific functions and classes from local modules and define some string variables, likely for configuration or metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading from the local modules '.discovery', '.light', and '.exceptions'; assigning string literals to variables.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that could lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted data; no network or file operations observed.",
  "flows": "Imported functions/classes may be used elsewhere, but within this code, there are no flows from input sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variable names that do not clearly indicate their purpose; the email string is hardcoded, which could be benign or malicious depending on context. No dynamic code execution, no suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of import statements and three variable assignments. The variable names are obscure and do not provide clarity, but there is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or code injection. The email and version string are hardcoded, which is common in configuration files. No suspicious modules or functions are invoked. Overall, the code appears benign and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard imports and defines some metadata variables without any suspicious or malicious behavior. There are no indicators of malware, supply chain attacks, or security risks based on this fragment.",
