  "purpose": "BLE device controller managing connection, notifications, and device commands (power, color).",
  "sources": "Device address, notification data, command UUIDs.",
  "sinks": "Notification callback, BLE characteristic writes.",
  "flows": "Connection -> Notification setup -> Device control commands -> Notification handling.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and class names; import inside constructor; no hardcoded secrets or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code manages BLE connections, handles notifications, and controls device features using standard practices. Obfuscation appears in variable and class names but lacks malicious techniques like code injection or network exfiltration. Exception handling and logging are standard. No signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data leaks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical BLE device management library with obfuscated naming but no malicious or security-threatening behavior. Obfuscation is moderate and not indicative of malicious intent. Overall, the code is benign.",
