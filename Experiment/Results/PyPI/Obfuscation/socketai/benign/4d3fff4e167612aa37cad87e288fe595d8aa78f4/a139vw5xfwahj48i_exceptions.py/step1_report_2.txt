  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths due to lack of executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "The class name appears obfuscated and does not indicate a clear purpose; no additional code or logic provided.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a class definition for a custom exception with an obfuscated name. There are no other code elements, input handling, or external interactions. The class inherits from Exception but does not contain any methods or attributes. The obfuscated name could be an attempt to conceal purpose, but as it stands, it's simply a class declaration with no malicious behavior or evidence of sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, harmless class definition with an obfuscated name. No malicious activity, security risks, or anomalies are evident from this snippet.",
