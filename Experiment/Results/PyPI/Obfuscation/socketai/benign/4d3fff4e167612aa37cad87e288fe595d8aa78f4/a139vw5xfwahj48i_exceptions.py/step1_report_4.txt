  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class named zrxhzpBrLtDMDaeeXqSHuCySsPMMVgrC.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations present.",
  "sinks": "No data outputs or sensitive sink operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flow, input, or output operations are present.",
  "anomalies": "The class name appears obfuscated or intentionally obscure; no other anomalies observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a class definition that inherits from Exception with a deliberately obfuscated name. There are no data sources, sinks, or flows. The obfuscated class name suggests possible concealment, but functionally it is just a custom exception class without any embedded malicious code or behavior. No suspicious activity, data leaks, or malicious patterns are detectable within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple custom exception class with an obfuscated name. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks based solely on this code fragment.",
