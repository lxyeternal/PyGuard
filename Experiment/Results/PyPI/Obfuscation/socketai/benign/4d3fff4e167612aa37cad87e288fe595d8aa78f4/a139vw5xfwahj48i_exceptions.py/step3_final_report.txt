{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class with an obfuscated name, likely used for specialized error handling.",
  "sources": "Class name assignment, inheriting from Exception",
  "sinks": "No data input/output, external interactions, or data leaks present",
  "flows": "Class instantiation and raising, if used elsewhere, but not shown in this snippet",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class name, no methods or logic, minimal code structure",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward class definition for a custom exception with an obfuscated name. It contains no methods, data handling, or external interactions. The obfuscated name could be intended to hide the class's purpose but does not, in itself, indicate malicious activity. Malware and security risk scores are appropriately low; the obfuscation score is high due to the nonsensical name. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident within this isolated snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a custom exception class with an obfuscated name. While the obfuscation raises suspicion, there is no evidence of malicious intent or activity. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with this assessment, with malware score at 0, obfuscation around 0.8, and security risk near 0.1.",
