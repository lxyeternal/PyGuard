  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class named zrxhzpBrLtDMDaeeXqSHuCySsPMMVgrC",
  "sources": "No external data sources; class definition is static",
  "sinks": "No sinks; class is only a simple exception subclass",
  "flows": "No data flow; no input/output or data processing",
  "anomalies": "Class name appears obfuscated and nonsensical, which could be suspicious; no other code to analyze",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single custom exception class with a seemingly random, obfuscated name. There are no methods, data processing, or external interactions. The class inherits from Exception, which is standard in Python. The code does not perform any malicious activity by itself. The obfuscated class name could be used to hide malicious intent in larger code, but alone, it is not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple class definition for a custom exception with an obfuscated name. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident in this isolated snippet.",
