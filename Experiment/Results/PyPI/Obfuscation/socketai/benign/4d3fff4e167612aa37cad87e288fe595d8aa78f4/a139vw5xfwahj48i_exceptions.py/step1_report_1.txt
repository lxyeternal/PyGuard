  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or external data.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write data or perform any actions that could lead to data leaks or malicious activity.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only class definition present.",
  "anomalies": "Class name appears to be a randomly generated or obfuscated string; no meaningful or descriptive naming.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of Exception with an arbitrary, obfuscated class name. There are no methods, no input/output operations, and no suspicious behaviors. The class serves as a custom exception but its obfuscated name may be indicative of obfuscation or malicious intent. However, in isolation, it does not perform any malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely consists of a class definition for a custom exception with an obfuscated name. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks within this snippet. The obfuscated name may suggest an attempt at hiding intent, but without additional context, it is benign.",
