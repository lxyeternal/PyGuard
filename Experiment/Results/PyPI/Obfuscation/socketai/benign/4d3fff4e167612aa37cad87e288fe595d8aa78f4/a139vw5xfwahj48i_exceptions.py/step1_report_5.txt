  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class named zrxhzpBrLtDMDaeeXqSHuCySsPMMVgrC.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data transmission points are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or source-to-sink paths in this code.",
  "anomalies": "The class name appears to be a nonsensical, obfuscated, or randomly generated string, which could indicate obfuscation or malicious intent. The code itself is minimal and does not contain any functionality beyond class definition.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single custom exception class inheriting from Exception. The class name is unusual and appears intentionally obfuscated, which can be a tactic to hide malicious intent or make analysis harder. There are no inputs, data processing, or external interactions. The minimalistic nature limits the potential for malicious behavior but the obfuscated class name raises suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "This code does not perform any malicious actions by itself. However, the obfuscated class name suggests potential concealment or obfuscation, warranting caution if found in a broader context. It appears to serve as a placeholder or intentionally obscure component without inherent malicious activity.",
