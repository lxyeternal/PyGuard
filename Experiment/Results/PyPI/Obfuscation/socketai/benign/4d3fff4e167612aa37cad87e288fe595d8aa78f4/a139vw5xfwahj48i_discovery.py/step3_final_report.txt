  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names; import from relative modules with nonsensical names",
  "analysis": "The code performs asynchronous Bluetooth scanning using bleak, filters devices based on a predefined UUID list, and creates device info objects for matching devices. The variable and function names are intentionally obfuscated, which could be an attempt to conceal purpose but does not indicate malicious activity. No network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications are evident. Exception handling is standard. The obfuscation level is moderate to high, raising suspicion but not proof of malicious intent. The malware score is justified as 0 due to lack of malicious behavior. The obfuscation score is high (~0.7), and the security risk score is low (~0.2), reflecting caution due to obfuscation but no active threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Bluetooth device scanner with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malware or malicious activity. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not constitute a security threat based on this snippet.",
