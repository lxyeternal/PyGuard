  "purpose": "Assess the supply chain security and malicious potential of the provided Python code snippet.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include environment variables, user inputs, network calls, and utility functions within the code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks involve system commands, network transmissions, file operations, or data leaks resulting from untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or user inputs to sinks like system commands or network endpoints, potentially leading to security issues if untrusted data is mishandled.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are detected; code appears straightforward and benign.",
  "analysis": "All reports consistently describe minimal, standard code with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The malware scores are uniformly zero, indicating no malicious intent. Security risk scores are low (0.2), reflecting cautious but low concern given incomplete context. Confidence levels are moderate to high, aligning with the limited code snippets. The assessments are justified, and the scoring is appropriate based on the provided descriptions.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets are benign, with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score is justified, and the assessments are consistent and well-founded. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
