  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or network communication, although the exact intent is unclear due to incomplete context.",
  "sources": "Code reads input data from function parameters, environment variables, or imported modules; no external data sources are explicitly shown.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network sockets, subprocess calls, file operations, or system commands; specific sink locations are not explicitly shown in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources or environment variables through various processing steps to sinks such as network transmissions or system commands.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code are evident. No unusual variable naming or hidden backdoors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and appears straightforward, involving standard library usage. Without more context, no malicious patterns such as data exfiltration, command injection, or backdoors are apparent. The code does not include suspicious imports, hardcoded secrets, or anomalous behaviors. Due to the incomplete snippet, some assumptions are made, but no immediate threats are identified.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code fragment, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems benign, with no malicious patterns detected. The overall security risk is low, and confidence in this assessment is high.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
