  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Reads from environment variables, files, network connections, use of eval/exec, hardcoded URLs, and system file modifications.",
  "sinks": "Network communication to suspicious domains, writing to system files like '/etc/passwd', executing untrusted code via 'exec', data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Input sources (env vars, files) flow into network sockets, file writes, and code execution points; untrusted data flows into sinks via 'exec' and network connections.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded malicious URLs, use of 'exec' with unvalidated data, obfuscation hints, writing to sensitive system files, complex code structures suggesting obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits multiple malicious indicators: network connections to known malicious domains, system file modifications, dynamic code execution on untrusted data, and obfuscation. The scores assigned (malware=0.8, obfuscated=0.6, risk=0.85) are justified by these indicators. Absence of code in some reports limits analysis but the summaries are cautious and appropriate. The suspicion levels are consistent with the described behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains high likelihood of malicious behavior, including potential data exfiltration, system compromise, and code injection. The scores reflect these risks accurately. The overall security risk is high, and the malware suspicion is justified. Some reports lack code, limiting definitive conclusions, but the evidence in the available reports warrants caution.",
