{
  "purpose": "Dynamically imports a session engine module and returns a session store instance.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'settings.SESSION_ENGINE' attribute to determine which session backend module to import.",
  "sinks": "The import_module function loads the session backend module based on external configuration; the function then returns the SessionStore class from that module.",
  "flows": "Code reads 'settings.SESSION_ENGINE' -> import_module imports the specified module -> function returns the SessionStore class from the imported module.",
  "anomalies": "The import statement for 'settings' is missing; the variable 'settings' is undefined within this scope, which would cause a runtime error. The import of 'vJQcsGgeScCwuJGobEpqomayydcNSNGw' appears to be unused and irrelevant. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code aims to import a session backend dynamically based on configuration. However, it references 'settings.SESSION_ENGINE' without importing or defining 'settings', leading to a NameError at runtime. The import of 'django.conf' with a nonsensical variable name suggests obfuscation or an error, but it's unused. Overall, no malicious behavior or malware is evident; the main issue is incomplete implementation or obfuscation that prevents proper execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is intended to dynamically load a session backend but is incomplete or improperly implemented due to missing 'settings' context. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected, but the code as provided would not run correctly. The suspicious import of a nonsensical variable and missing 'settings' indicates potential obfuscation or errors, but no malware or security risks are evident.",
