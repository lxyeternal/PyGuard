  "flows": "Importing module based on configuration -> returning its SessionStore class",
  "anomalies": "The 'django.conf' import includes an obfuscated variable 'vJQcsGgeScCwuJGobEpqomayydcNSNGw', which is unused and appears suspicious; no direct usage or assignment to a variable, possibly obfuscation or code noise",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'import_module' for dynamic module import, then imports an obfuscated variable from 'django.conf', which is unused. The function dynamically imports a session engine module specified in 'settings.SESSION_ENGINE' and returns its 'SessionStore' class. The obfuscated variable suggests possible code hiding or obfuscation, but it is not used, thus unlikely malicious. The main operation is standard for dynamic session engine loading. No evident malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or hidden actions.\n\nThe obfuscation might be an attempt to evade static analysis, but since it is unused, it does not impact runtime behavior or security.\n\nOverall, the code appears to perform a typical dynamic import based on configuration with some obfuscation noise.",
  "conclusion": "The code dynamically loads a session store class based on configuration, with obfuscation in variable naming that appears to serve as noise rather than malicious intent. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident from this snippet.",
