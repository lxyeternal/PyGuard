  "purpose": "Import a session store class dynamically using Django's import_module.",
  "sources": "import_module function call, reference to settings.SESSION_ENGINE",
  "sinks": "import_module dynamically loads module based on untrusted input; return statement accesses SessionStore",
  "flows": "import_module reads SESSION_ENGINE; the returned SessionStore could be used to handle session data",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious import from django.conf with a variable name that appears obfuscated or nonsensical; no direct usage of untrusted input, but the variable name 'vJQcsGgeScCwuJGobEpqomayydcNSNGw' is unusual",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'import_module' from importlib, then attempts to import a module specified by 'settings.SESSION_ENGINE'. The variable 'vJQcsGgeScCwuJGobEpqomayydcNSNGw' is declared but not used, suggesting obfuscation or renaming. The function returns the SessionStore class from the dynamically imported session engine. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or obfuscated code are evident beyond the variable naming. The use of import_module with a potentially configurable module path ('settings.SESSION_ENGINE') is standard in Django for session management, but if 'settings.SESSION_ENGINE' is tampered with, it could lead to importing malicious modules. However, no malicious behavior is directly visible here.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard pattern for dynamically importing a session engine in Django, with an unusual variable name that could suggest obfuscation. No active malicious activity or backdoors are apparent. The code's security depends on the integrity of 'settings.SESSION_ENGINE'.",
