{
  "purpose": "Import and return a Django session store class based on the SESSION_ENGINE setting.",
  "sources": "The code reads the SESSION_ENGINE setting from the imported settings module.",
  "markets": "The code imports the import_module function and attempts to dynamically load the session store class from the specified SESSION_ENGINE.",
  "flows": "The setting 'settings.SESSION_ENGINE' is used as input to import_module, which loads the session store module; then the SessionStore class is returned.",
  "anomalies": "The import statement for 'django.conf' uses a nonsensical attribute 'vJQcsGgeScCwuJGobEpqomayydcNSNGw' instead of the standard 'settings'. This indicates possible obfuscation or code corruption. The function name is also nonsensical.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to dynamically import a session store class based on the Django settings. However, the import statement for 'django.conf' is corrupted or obfuscated, which prevents proper execution and suggests suspicious intent or code obfuscation. The overall structure resembles legitimate code, but the malformed import indicates potential malicious obfuscation or corruption. There are no signs of malicious behavior like data exfiltration, network connections, or backdoors, but the obfuscated import raises concerns about code integrity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be obfuscated or corrupted, which might be intentional to hide malicious intent or simply a mistake. There is no direct evidence of malicious behavior, but the malformed import statement warrants suspicion and further review. Overall security risk is moderate due to obfuscation.",
