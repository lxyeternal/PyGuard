  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the context, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code is importing from Django modules with obfuscated or nonsensical names.\n- It defines template tags that expose version and environment info via static attributes.\n- No direct malicious activity (network, data exfiltration, code injection) is observed.\n- The attributes accessed are seemingly benign, related to versioning and environment info.\n- The obfuscation could be an attempt to hide malicious intent or simply to obscure implementation details.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose:** Render version and environment info.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity; the code exposes version info for display.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, security risk = 0.2, obfuscated = 0.6, confidence = 0.7.\n\n**Verdict:** The low malware score is justified; obfuscation is noted but not malicious. Security risk is minimal.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose:** Define template tags for version/environment info.\n- **Analysis:** Obfuscated module name raises suspicion, but no malicious activity.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0.8, risk = 0.3, confidence = 0.6.\n\n**Verdict:** The high obfuscation score is justified. No malware detected. Slightly higher security risk due to obfuscation, but overall benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar to above.\n- **Analysis:** Same pattern—obfuscated names, no malicious code.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0.8, risk = 0.3, confidence = 0.6.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent with previous assessments. Obfuscation is a concern but not proof of maliciousness.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose:** Expose version/env info.\n- **Analysis:** Obfuscated names, but straightforward data retrieval.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0.7, risk = 0.2, confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** The high confidence score aligns with the straightforward, benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose:** Utility for injecting version/env info.\n- **Analysis:** Same pattern—obfuscated but benign.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0.7, risk = 0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent with previous reports.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** High, due to the nonsensical import and variable names, which could be used to hide malicious intent.\n- **Risk score:** Very low, as the code is primarily exposing static info without sensitive data or operations.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- The obfuscation warrants caution. The code should be reviewed in the broader context—what is inside the imported module? Is it from a trusted source?\n- The scores are reasonable; no adjustments needed.\n- The malware score should remain at 0 unless further evidence emerges.\n- The obfuscated score could be slightly higher if the obfuscation is suspected to conceal malicious code, but 0.7-0.8 seems appropriate here.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.7 (consistent with reports)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (low, benign purpose)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears to be a benign utility for exposing version and environment info, with obfuscation as the main concern. No malicious activity is evident, but further review of the imported module is recommended to confirm its integrity.",
