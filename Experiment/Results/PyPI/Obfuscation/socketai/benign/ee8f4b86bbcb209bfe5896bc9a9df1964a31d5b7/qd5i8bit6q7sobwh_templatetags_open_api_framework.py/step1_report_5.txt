{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom Django template tags to include version and environment information in templates, likely for display purposes.",
  "sources": "Data is read from the module 'vJQcsGgeScCwuJGobEpqomayydcNSNGw' via getattr() calls for attributes 'RELEASE', 'GIT_SHA', and 'ENVIRONMENT'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; the code only retrieves data for template rendering. No untrusted input is processed or output directly.",
  "flows": "The code reads attributes from a module and supplies them to templates; there are no data flows from external sources to insecure sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The module and attribute names are obfuscated, which may indicate an attempt to conceal purpose, but the code itself performs straightforward data retrieval for display.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module with an obfuscated name and a class from the Django framework with an obfuscated name. It creates a class instance and defines two template tags that fetch static attribute data from the module for inclusion in templates. No input validation, no external data processing, and no security-sensitive operations are observed. The use of obfuscated names alone does not indicate malicious intent but warrants caution. There is no evidence of malware or malicious behavior. The code appears to be standard for injecting version/environment info into templates.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for injecting version and environment information into Django templates. No malicious or security-threatening behavior is detected. The obfuscation might be for hiding implementation details but does not inherently indicate malicious intent.",
