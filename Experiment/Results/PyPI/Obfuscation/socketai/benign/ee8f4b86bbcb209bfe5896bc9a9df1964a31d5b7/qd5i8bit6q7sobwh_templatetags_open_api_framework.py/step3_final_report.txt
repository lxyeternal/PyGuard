  "purpose": "Expose version and environment information via Django template tags for display or diagnostic purposes.",
  "sources": "Imports from obfuscated Django modules and attribute access via getattr() on an imported object/module.",
  "sinks": "Template rendering exposing version and environment info; no direct data leaks or external data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Imported module/object attributes ('RELEASE', 'GIT_SHA', 'ENVIRONMENT') are accessed via getattr() and passed into templates.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated import names and variable identifiers; no malicious code or network activity detected in the snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code's primary function is to expose static environment and version info through Django templates. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not inherently indicate malicious intent. No evidence of malicious activity, such as network calls, data exfiltration, or code injection, is present. The use of getattr() on an imported module/object to retrieve versioning and environment data is standard for diagnostic purposes. The obfuscated naming could be a tactic to hide malicious code, but based solely on this snippet, the code appears benign. The security risk is low, but the obfuscation warrants further review of the actual imported module's content to ensure it is trustworthy.",
  "conclusion": "The code is likely a benign utility for exposing environment and version info in Django templates. The obfuscation is suspicious but not evidence of malicious activity. No malware detected. The overall security risk is low, but further investigation of the imported module is recommended to confirm its integrity.",
