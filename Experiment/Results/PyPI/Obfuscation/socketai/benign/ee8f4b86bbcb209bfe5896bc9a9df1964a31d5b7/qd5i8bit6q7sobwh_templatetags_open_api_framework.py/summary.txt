  "confidence": 0.8,
  "conclusion": "The code is likely a benign utility for exposing environment and version info in Django templates. The obfuscation is suspicious but not evidence of malicious activity. No malware detected. The overall security risk is low, but further investigation of the imported module is recommended to confirm its integrity."
