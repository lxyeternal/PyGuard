  "purpose": "Render version and environment information for Django template components.",
  "sources": "Imports from Django modules, access to attributes of vJQcsGgeScCwuJGobEpqomayydcNSNGw",

  "flows": "Attributes from vJQcsGgeScCwuJGobEpqomayydcNSNGw to template context variables",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated or nonsensical import names, dynamic attribute access via getattr, no visible malicious activity",
  "analysis": "The code imports potentially obfuscated Django modules, creates template tags that return static attributes from an imported module or object. These attributes seem to relate to versioning and environment info, typically used for display purposes. No hardcoded secrets, malicious network activity, or data exfiltration observed. The obfuscated naming might be a concern, but it does not inherently indicate malicious intent. The code simply exposes environment and version info, which is common in diagnostic or admin contexts.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be designed for benign purposes, exposing version and environment details for templates. No malicious behavior detected. The obfuscated import and attribute names may be suspicious but are not proof of malicious intent. Overall, the code is likely safe but should be reviewed in the broader context for potential misuse.",
