  "purpose": "Define Django template tags to include version and environment information in templates",
  "sources": "Imports from django modules, access to attributes 'RELEASE', 'GIT_SHA', 'ENVIRONMENT' from a settings module-like object",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks of untrusted data or data leaks; reads configuration attributes",
  "flows": "Imports → attribute access from configuration object → returned data for template rendering",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated or nonsensical import names and variable names; no clear indication of malicious intent; no hardcoded secrets or network activity",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django modules with obfuscated names, accesses configuration attributes, and defines template tags to insert version and environment info into templates. The import names and variable names appear intentionally obscure, but no malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or code injection is evident. The code simply exposes configuration data for templating purposes. The structure and logic are consistent with standard Django practices, albeit with obfuscated identifiers, which could suggest an attempt to conceal intent, but not necessarily maliciousness.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign implementation of Django template tags that expose versioning and environment info. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The obfuscated naming does not directly imply malicious intent but warrants cautious review in context. Overall, the code is safe based on the provided snippet.",
