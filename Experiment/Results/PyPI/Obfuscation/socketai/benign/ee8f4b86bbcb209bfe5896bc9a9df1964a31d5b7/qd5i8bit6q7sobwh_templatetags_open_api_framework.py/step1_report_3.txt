{
  "purpose": "Define Django template tags for displaying version and environment information.",
  "sources": "Imports from Django modules, access to attributes of vJQcsGgeScCwuJGobEpqomayydcNSNGw object.",
  "sinks": "getattr calls that access attributes of vJQcsGgeScCwuJGobEpqomayydcNSNGw, potentially exposing sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Imports -> attribute access -> template context dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated module and attribute names, which could be intentional to hide malicious intent; no explicit malicious code or network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django modules and a suspiciously named module, then creates template tags to expose version and environment data via context variables. The obfuscated names could be an attempt to conceal malicious intent or sensitive data access, but no direct malicious activity such as network communication, data exfiltration, or system modification is evident. The use of getattr to access attributes may potentially expose sensitive information if vJQcsGgeScCwuJGobEpqomayydcNSNGw contains secrets. Overall, the code appears to be benign in functionality but intentionally obfuscated, which warrants cautious review.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily designed to expose version and environment information through Django template tags. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not directly indicate malicious behavior. No malicious code or malware is evident based on the provided snippet. The main concern is the obfuscated naming, which could be used to hide malicious intent or sensitive data access, so it should be reviewed in the context of the larger project.",
