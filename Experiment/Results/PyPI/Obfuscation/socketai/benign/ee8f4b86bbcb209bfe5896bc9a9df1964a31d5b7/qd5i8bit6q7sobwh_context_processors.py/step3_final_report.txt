  "purpose": "Retrieve environment and version information from an obfuscated module, likely for debugging or display purposes.",
  "sources": "Attributes accessed via getattr on the imported obfuscated module, such as ENVIRONMENT_SHOWN_IN_ADMIN, GIT_SHA, RELEASE, ENVIRONMENT.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only reads data and returns it in a dictionary without external communication or data modification.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the imported module attributes to the returned dictionary; no external sinks or data leaks are present.",
  "anomalies": "Use of an obfuscated module name which is unusual and suspicious; no malicious code detected but obfuscation warrants caution.",
  "analysis": "The code imports an obfuscated module and accesses environment/version info attributes, returning them in a dictionary. No external sinks or malicious behaviors are evident. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not imply malicious intent. The code is straightforward and safe, with the main concern being the obscured module name. Scores assigned by previous reports are consistent with this analysis, with malware scores at zero and obfuscation scores reflecting suspicion. No evidence of malicious activity or data leaks is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as an environment info retriever. The obfuscation is suspicious but not malicious. Further investigation into the source of the module is recommended, but based on this snippet, there is no malicious behavior.",
