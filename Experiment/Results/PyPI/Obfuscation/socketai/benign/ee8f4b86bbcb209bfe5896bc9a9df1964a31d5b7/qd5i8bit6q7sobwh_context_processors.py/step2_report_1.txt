  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the scores.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Imports an obfuscated module `vJQcsGgeScCwuJGobEpqomayydcNSNGw` from `django.conf`.\n- Defines a function that:\n  - Checks if the user is staff (`request.user.is_staff`).\n  - Retrieves environment and version info via `getattr` on the imported module.\n  - Returns a dictionary with these details.\n\n**Key points:**\n- The import is obfuscated, which is suspicious.\n- No external or untrusted input influences the environment data.\n- No data is sent externally or written to disk/network.\n- The function appears to be for environment info retrieval, likely for admin/debug purposes.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Retrieve environment/version info, probably for display.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity detected; obfuscated import is suspicious but not malicious.\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct, no malware detected)\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 (low, mainly due to obfuscation)\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.8\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** Similar, with suspicion over obfuscation, but no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (low)\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.7\n\n**Verdict:** Correct. No malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Same purpose.\n- **Analysis:** Obfuscated module name; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 (low)\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.7\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Same.\n- **Analysis:** Obfuscated module, but no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Security risk:** 0.3 (still low)\n- **Confidence:** 0.7\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.8\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Same.\n- **Analysis:** Straightforward environment info retrieval, obfuscation present but no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (very low)\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.2\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Consistency:\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, with suspicion over obfuscation.\n- Malware scores are all zero, which aligns with the code analysis.\n- Security risks are low, reflecting the benign nature.\n- Confidence levels are high, indicating the reviewers are confident in their assessments.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code itself is not malicious.\n- The obfuscated import raises suspicion but is not inherently malicious.\n- No evidence of malware, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior.\n- The scores are consistent and reasonable across reports.\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.7 — obfuscation is significant and warrants caution.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — low, mainly due to obfuscation.\n\n**Summary:** The code appears to be a benign environment info retriever, with obfuscation as the only concern. No malicious activity is evident from the snippet.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** While the code is not malicious, the obfuscation could hide malicious intent elsewhere. Further investigation into the source of the module is recommended before deploying in production.",
