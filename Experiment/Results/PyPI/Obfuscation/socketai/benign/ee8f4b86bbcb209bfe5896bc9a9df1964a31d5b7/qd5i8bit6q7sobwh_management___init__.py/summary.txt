  "conclusion": "All reports indicate benign code with no confirmed malicious activity. The primary concern is the mention of eval()/exec(), which warrants a higher risk score if such functions are used insecurely. Adjusting the overall security risk for Report 1 to 0.5 reflects this potential. Malware and obfuscation scores remain at 0, consistent with the evidence. Overall, the dependency appears safe, but vigilance is advised if dynamic code execution practices are confirmed."
