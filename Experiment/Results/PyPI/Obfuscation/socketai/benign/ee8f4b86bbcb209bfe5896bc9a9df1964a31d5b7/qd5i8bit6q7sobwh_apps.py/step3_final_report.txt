{
  "purpose": "Static Django AppConfig subclass with obfuscated class name and attribute, no malicious behavior detected.",
  "sources": "Class definition, class name, class attribute assignment",
  "sinks": "None, as code is static and does not process untrusted input or perform external actions",
  "flows": "None, no data flow or external communication present",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class name and attribute, but no suspicious logic or behavior",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static Django AppConfig subclass with obfuscated identifiers. No dynamic code, external calls, or data processing are present. Obfuscation alone does not imply malicious intent; the code appears benign. No evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, or external communication. The obfuscation scores are high, reflecting naming patterns, but do not indicate malicious activity. Malware score remains at 0, as no malicious behavior is observed. Risk score is low, consistent with the static, benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with obfuscation that warrants cautious review but does not constitute malicious activity. Scores are appropriate; no changes necessary.",
