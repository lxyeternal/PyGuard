  "purpose": "Define a Django application configuration class with an obfuscated class name and a class attribute.",
  "sources": "The class definition and the attribute assignment.",
  "sinks": "No apparent data sinks or output points; no external data handling or untrusted data usage.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code is only a class declaration with a string attribute.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual class name and attribute name, both obfuscated, which can be suspicious but are not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports AppConfig from django.apps and defines a class with an obfuscated name that inherits from AppConfig. Inside, it sets an attribute with a string value. The obfuscation may be for concealment but does not indicate malicious intent. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears to be a standard Django configuration class, albeit intentionally obfuscated.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not demonstrate malicious behavior. The obfuscation may be for concealment or stylistic reasons but poses no security risk or malware indication based on this snippet alone.",
