  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate build configuration for a Windows extension module, with obfuscated identifiers that could be for concealment. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or data exfiltration. The current scores are consistent with this assessment, with high obfuscation but no malicious activity detected."
