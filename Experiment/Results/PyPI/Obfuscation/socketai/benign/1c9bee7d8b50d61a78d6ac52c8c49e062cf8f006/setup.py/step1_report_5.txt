  "purpose": "This code is intended to define package setup configuration using setuptools for Python packaging.",
  "sources": "The only source of data is the import statement 'from setuptools import setup'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows involving untrusted input are present; the code does not process or execute untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink; the code simply imports and calls setup().",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard; there are no unusual or suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setup' from 'setuptools' and immediately calls setup() with no arguments. This is a common pattern in Python packaging scripts. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues. The code is straightforward and uses standard library functions for package setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical minimal setup script for a Python package, containing no malicious behavior or security risks.",
