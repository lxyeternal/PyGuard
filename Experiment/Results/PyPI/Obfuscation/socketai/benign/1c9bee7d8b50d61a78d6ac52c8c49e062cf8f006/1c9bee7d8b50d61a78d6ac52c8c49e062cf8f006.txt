      "conclusion": "The snippet appears to be obfuscated and potentially incomplete, raising suspicion but showing no concrete evidence of malicious activity. The high obfuscation scores are justified, but malware and risk scores should remain low. Further investigation into the actual content of the imported object and the full package is recommended."

      "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated translation utility with complex token generation routines. While it does not contain evidence of malicious payloads or backdoors, its obfuscation warrants cautious handling. It could potentially be used to conceal malicious activity or API abuse, but based on the provided code and reports, no direct malicious behavior is present."
