{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be defining module exports and importing a specific class or object from a local module named 'google'.",
  "sources": "Import statement: 'from .google import TnBmvdRxnOIHAQFbuHRObKksPvPmOSxA' and the assignment of a version string to 'rpufINktNxAfzllggoSbzKKPsgjAeFbB'.",
  "sinks": "Potential sink is the import of 'TnBmvdRxnOIHAQFbuHRObKksPvPmOSxA', which could be malicious if it performs harmful actions internally. The version string assignment is benign.",
  "flows": "Import source flows into the module's namespace. No further data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable name 'TnBmvdRxnOIHAQFbuHRObKksPvPmOSxA', which suggests possible obfuscation or hidden intent. The import from a relative module with a seemingly random name indicates potential concealment.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific component from a local module using an obfuscated identifier, which could be a tactic to hide malicious code. The variable 'rpufINktNxAfzllggoSbzKKPsgjAeFbB' storing a version number is harmless. No other suspicious behavior or data leaks are visible. However, the obfuscated import raises concern about hiding malicious functionality within 'TnBmvdRxnOIHAQFbuHRObKksPvPmOSxA'.",
  "conclusion": "While the visible code is minimal and appears to set up module exports, the use of obfuscated identifiers and a potentially concealed import source warrants caution. The code could be part of a larger, potentially malicious package aiming to hide malicious behavior in imported components.",
