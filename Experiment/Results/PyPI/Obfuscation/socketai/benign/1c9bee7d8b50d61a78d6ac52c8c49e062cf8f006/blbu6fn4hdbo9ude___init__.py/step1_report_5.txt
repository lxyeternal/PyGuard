{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a module that imports a specific attribute or class from a local 'google' module and defines an export list and a version string.",
  "sources": "Reading the local 'google' module for 'TnBmvdRxnOIHAQFbuHRObKksPvPmOSxA' and the version string assignment.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data sinks or external calls are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code simply imports and defines variables.",
  "anomalies": "The imported attribute has a seemingly random or obfuscated name, and the version variable is a non-descriptive string, possibly indicating obfuscation or concealed intent. No actual malicious behavior is apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific symbol from a local module, which could be part of normal operation or obfuscation. The presence of a randomly named variable and the minimal structure suggests obfuscation or concealment but does not inherently indicate malicious intent. No suspicious data flows, network activity, or malicious actions are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal and does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks by itself. The obfuscated variable names might suggest intentional concealment, but there is no evidence of malicious activity based on this snippet.",
