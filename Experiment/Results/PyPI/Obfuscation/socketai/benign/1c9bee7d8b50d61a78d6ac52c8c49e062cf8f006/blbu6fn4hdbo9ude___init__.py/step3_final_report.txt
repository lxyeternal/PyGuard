{
  "purpose": "The code imports an obfuscated attribute from a local module and sets an export list and version string, likely as part of a larger package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module (.google), reading the attribute TnBmvdRxnOIHAQFbuHRObKksPvPmOSxA",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or data leaks; no external communication or data processing observed",
  "flows": "Import source flows into the module namespace; no further data flow evident in this snippet",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated attribute and variable names, __all__ referencing an undefined symbol 'GoogleTranslate', incomplete code context",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, with obfuscated identifiers suggesting concealment but no direct malicious activity. The import could be benign or malicious internally, but without further context, no malicious behavior can be confirmed. The __all__ list references 'GoogleTranslate' which is not defined here, indicating incomplete or obfuscated code. The version string is harmless. The high obfuscation scores across reports are justified, but the malware scores should remain low due to lack of evidence. The overall security risk is low but warrants caution due to obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet appears to be obfuscated and potentially incomplete, raising suspicion but showing no concrete evidence of malicious activity. The high obfuscation scores are justified, but malware and risk scores should remain low. Further investigation into the actual content of the imported object and the full package is recommended.",
