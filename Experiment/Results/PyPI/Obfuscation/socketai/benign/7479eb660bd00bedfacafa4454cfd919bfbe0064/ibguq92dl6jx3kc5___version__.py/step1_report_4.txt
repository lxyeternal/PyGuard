  "purpose": "Assigns a version string '1.5.2' to a variable.",
  "sources": "Assignment statement where the variable 'OSMlVSZFZkTDvLHwcVhjWxwyoRsaPspL' is assigned a string value.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks identified; no external data or untrusted sources used.",
  "flows": "Assignment of a static string to a variable; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The variable name appears obfuscated or nonsensical, which could be an attempt to hide intent. No other unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a string '1.5.2' to a variable with an obfuscated name. There are no imports, no function calls, no external data reads, no network activity, and no malicious logic. The variable name's obscurity could be suspicious, but the code itself is benign and minimal.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward variable assignment with an obfuscated variable name. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this fragment.",
