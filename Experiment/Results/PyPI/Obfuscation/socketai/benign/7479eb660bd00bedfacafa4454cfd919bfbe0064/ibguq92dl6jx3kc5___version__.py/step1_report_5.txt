  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources; no user input or external data used",
  "flows": "None, as the code only assigns a string to a variable",
  "anomalies": "Variable name appears obfuscated, but no malicious activity is apparent; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a variable assignment with an obfuscated variable name and a version string. There are no data flows, no input/output operations, and no other code segments. The variable name does not match common patterns, but that alone does not indicate malicious intent. The assigned value is a version number string. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple variable assignment of a version string with an obfuscated variable name. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are present. The code appears benign.",
