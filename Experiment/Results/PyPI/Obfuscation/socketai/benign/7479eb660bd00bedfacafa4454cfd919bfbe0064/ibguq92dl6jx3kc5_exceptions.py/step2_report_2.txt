  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All code snippets define a custom exception class inheriting from Exception.\n- The class names are consistently obfuscated or nonsensical strings, which could suggest obfuscation or code concealment.\n- There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, code injection, or use of secrets.\n- The code is minimal and straightforward, primarily serving as a data container for error handling.\n- The reports assign a malware score of 0 across all instances, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- The obfuscation scores are high (mostly 0.7–0.8), indicating suspicion about the naming, but not necessarily malicious intent.\n- Security risk scores are low (mostly 0.2 or 0), reflecting minimal security concern based on the provided code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Potential Issues:\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify the code as a class definition with no data flow, input, or output.\n- **Malicious activity:** No evidence of malicious behavior is present in any of the snippets.\n- **Obfuscation:** The class names are obfuscated, which could be used to hide malicious intent but also could be just obfuscation for other reasons.\n\n### Logical flaws or reasoning issues:\n- The reports are consistent and cautious, correctly noting that obfuscated names alone do not imply malicious intent.\n- The high obfuscation scores are justified, but the malware scores should remain at 0 unless additional malicious indicators are found.\n\n### Score suggestions:\n- The malware scores are currently 0, which is appropriate given the analysis.\n- The security risk scores are low, consistent with the benign nature.\n- The obfuscation scores are high, justified by the class names.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is benign, with obfuscated naming possibly for concealment but no malicious behavior.\n- The scores across reports are reasonable and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.8 (consistent with obfuscated class names)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (minimal security risk, standard exception class)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code snippets are benign custom exception classes with obfuscated names. No evidence suggests malicious intent or security risks. The high obfuscation scores are justified, but malware remains at zero. The overall security posture based on these snippets is low risk.\n\nPlease let me know if further analysis of additional code or context is needed.",
