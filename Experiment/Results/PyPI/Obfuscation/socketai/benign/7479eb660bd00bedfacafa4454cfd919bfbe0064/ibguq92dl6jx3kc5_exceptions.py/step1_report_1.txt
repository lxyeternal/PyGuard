{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class for handling specific error scenarios with an optional original exception reference.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; class declaration and constructor initialization.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from input to output or across different parts of the code.",
  "anomalies": "The class name appears intentionally obfuscated or nonsensical, which could be suspicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class inheriting from Exception, with a constructor accepting a message and an original exception. The class name appears deliberately obfuscated or nonsensical, which could be a sign of intent to hide purpose. There are no data leaks, external calls, or suspicious behaviors within this snippet. It is a minimal, standard exception class with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, standard custom exception class with obfuscated naming, which alone does not indicate malicious behavior. No malware or security risks are evident.",
