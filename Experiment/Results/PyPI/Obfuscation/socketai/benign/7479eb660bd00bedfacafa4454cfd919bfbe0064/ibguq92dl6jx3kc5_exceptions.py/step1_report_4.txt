  "anomalies": "The class name 'DERPOprnwICroDMbtXHmLCDPWzENkHVb' appears to be a random string or obfuscated, which could indicate obfuscation or malicious intent, but it could also be an intentionally obscure name.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of Exception with an initializer that takes a message and an original_exception, passing the message to the base class and storing the original exception. The class structure is standard for custom exceptions. The class name is unusual and looks like a random or obfuscated string, which could be suspicious if intended to hide purpose, but on its own, it is not inherently malicious. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity, data theft, or system manipulation.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard custom exception class with an unusual name that may suggest obfuscation but does not demonstrate malicious behavior or security risks on its own.",
