  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for error handling with an embedded original exception reference",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources used",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external communications present",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; class simply initializes an exception object",
  "anomalies": "Class name appears to be a random string, not a meaningful identifier; no use of secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class inheriting from Exception, intended for custom error handling. The constructor calls the superclass initializer with a message and stores an original exception for debugging or chaining. No input reading, data transmission, or external interactions are present. The class name is unusual and appears to be a random string, but this alone is not suspicious or malicious. Overall, the code is a straightforward exception class with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign custom exception class with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The unusual class name does not indicate malicious intent but could be a placeholder or obfuscation. No security concerns are identified.",
