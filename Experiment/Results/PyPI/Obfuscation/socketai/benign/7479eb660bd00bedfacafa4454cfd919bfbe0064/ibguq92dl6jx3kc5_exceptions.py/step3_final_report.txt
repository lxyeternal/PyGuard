{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class inheriting from Exception, with a constructor accepting a message and an original exception.",
  "sources": "The class constructor reads the message and original_exception parameters; no external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed or output; no sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (message, original_exception) flow into the class constructor; no external or network flows are involved.",
  "anomalies": "The class name appears obfuscated or randomly generated, which is unusual but not inherently malicious; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward custom exception class with a constructor that stores an original exception. The class name's obfuscation is suspicious but not indicative of malicious behavior. No data flows, external calls, or malicious patterns are present. The high obfuscation score is justified given the class name, but malware and security risk scores remain at zero, consistent with the benign analysis. The code's simplicity and lack of malicious indicators suggest it is safe, though obfuscation warrants caution in larger contexts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated custom exception class with no malicious behavior or security risks. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware and security risk scores are appropriately low. No further action is necessary based on this snippet.",
