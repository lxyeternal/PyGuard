{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for error handling with an additional attribute for original exception details.",
  "sources": "Code reads the class definition, constructor parameters 'message' and 'original_exception'.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or output untrusted data directly.",
  "flows": "N/A; the class is a simple data container without active data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "The class name 'DERPOprnwICroDMbtXHmLCDPWzENkHVb' appears obfuscated or randomly generated, which could be suspicious, but no malicious activity is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of Exception with a constructor that initializes the message and stores an original exception object. There are no network operations, file operations, or code execution. The class name is unusual and likely obfuscated, which can be a red flag in malicious contexts, but alone does not confirm malicious intent. No other suspicious patterns or behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply defines a custom exception class with an obfuscated name. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscated class name is unusual but not inherently malicious. No security concerns detected.",
