  "purpose": "Re-exporting specific classes or functions from a local module named '_client' for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the local module '_client' that provide obfuscated identifiers.",
  "sinks": "The import statement could potentially load malicious or hidden code if '_client' contains malicious content; the use of __all__ is standard for defining public API.",
  "flows": "Code imports obfuscated names from '_client' and exposes certain names via __all__, without executing or processing data.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated names in the import statement; no direct indication of malicious behavior. The obfuscation may be legitimate or malicious; however, without the '_client' code, it’s suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports three entities with obfuscated names from a relative module '_client'. The use of such nonsensical identifiers is unusual and may be an attempt to hide malicious code or functionality. The code then defines __all__ with clear public API names. There is no direct evidence of malicious behavior in this snippet alone, but the obfuscated import names are suspicious and warrant further inspection of the '_client' module. No input sources or sinks are present beyond imports, and the code is minimal.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward re-export of components from a local module, but the use of obfuscated identifiers raises suspicion. Without examining the '_client' module, the potential for malicious behavior cannot be ruled out. Overall, this pattern alone is not definitively malicious but warrants caution.",
