  "purpose": "Re-exporting specific classes or functions from a local module '_client' for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing obfuscated names from the local module '_client'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; no external data flow is evident.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; import only static symbols.",
  "anomalies": "Imported symbols are obfuscated names that do not reveal their purpose. The code does not specify what these symbols do, raising suspicion about obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports three symbols with obfuscated names from a local module '_client' and exposes three publicly accessible class or function names. The presence of obfuscated identifiers suggests potential concealment of malicious code or simply internal implementation details. The code itself is minimal, performing a straightforward re-export. There are no apparent data flows, user inputs, or external data sources. The use of obfuscated names without accompanying documentation makes it difficult to assess the intent definitively. Given the lack of context and the obfuscated symbols, there is a moderate concern about potential concealment, but nothing conclusive is observable within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code primarily re-exports obfuscated symbols from a local module, which could indicate intentional concealment or simply internal naming conventions. No malicious activity is explicitly evident, but the obfuscation warrants caution and further review of the '_client' module for hidden behaviors.",
