{
  "purpose": "This code imports three obfuscated identifiers from a local '_client' module and re-exports three clearly named classes for public API.",
  "sources": "The import statement from ._client reading three symbols with obfuscated names.",
  "sinks": "The module exports class names via __all__, but no untrusted data flows or external interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Obfuscated imported symbols are assigned to internal identifiers; then __all__ exposes different class names, but no direct data flow or external sink is evident.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated, nonsensical identifiers in import statements; mismatch between imported symbols and exported class names; absence of context about the _client module.",
  "analysis": "The code is syntactically correct and minimal, importing three obfuscated symbols and exposing three public class names. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not demonstrate malicious activity. The __all__ list suggests a re-export pattern, possibly for API clarity. The lack of external data flows or network activity indicates low immediate risk. The main concern is the obfuscated identifiers, which could be used to conceal malicious code or simply be internal naming conventions. Scores assigned in reports are consistent: low malware likelihood, high obfuscation suspicion, moderate security risk. Further review of the _client module is recommended to verify the nature of the imported symbols.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself is a standard re-export module with obfuscated internal identifiers. There is no direct evidence of malicious activity, but the obfuscation warrants further inspection of the _client module. The current scores are appropriate, and no immediate threat is confirmed.",
