{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific classes or functions from a local module and defines an export list for the module.",
  "sources": "The code reads from a local module file named '_client'.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data could leak or cause harm; the code only performs import and export statements.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code solely imports obfuscated identifiers and declares exports.",
  "anomalies": "The imported identifiers are named with random or obfuscated-looking strings, which is unusual for typical code readability but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports three identifiers with seemingly random names from a relative module '_client'. It then sets the module's __all__ attribute to expose three class or function names: 'ScraperAPIClient', 'ScraperAPIAsyncClient', and 'ScraperAPIException'. The imported identifiers are not used elsewhere in this snippet. The use of obfuscated import names could indicate attempts to hide functionality or could be auto-generated code. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. This appears to be a standard import/export pattern with obfuscated internal identifiers.\n\nHowever, the obfuscation itself warrants noting, though it does not necessarily imply malicious intent. The actual security risk depends on what these obfuscated identifiers represent, but based solely on this snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard import and export operations with obfuscated internal identifiers. There is no apparent malicious activity or security risk in this snippet. The obfuscation could be accidental or for internal reasons but does not suggest malicious intent based on the available code.",
