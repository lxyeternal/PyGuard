  "purpose": "Re-exporting specific classes or variables from a local module '_client' for use in the package's public API.",
  "sources": "Import statement from ._client module, which may contain definitions of classes or variables.",
  "sinks": "No evident untrusted data sinks; no external data handling or output present.",
  "flows": "Import statements import internal symbols; no flow of untrusted data from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Imported symbols have obfuscated or nonsensical names, which is unusual for standard class or variable names. No definitions are provided here, raising suspicion of hiding or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports three symbols with seemingly random or obfuscated names from a local module '_client'. It then sets the __all__ variable to expose three well-known client classes. The obfuscated names suggest potential hiding or intentional concealment. However, without additional context or code from '_client', it's impossible to determine if these are malicious. The pattern could be benign if the actual classes are properly implemented elsewhere, or malicious if the obfuscated names mask malicious classes. No data flows or suspicious behavior are explicitly present in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to re-export specific classes, but the use of obfuscated names for imported symbols is suspicious. It warrants further inspection of the '_client' module to ensure these symbols are legitimate and not maliciously hidden. Based solely on this snippet, the maliciousness is uncertain but the obfuscation raises a security concern.",
