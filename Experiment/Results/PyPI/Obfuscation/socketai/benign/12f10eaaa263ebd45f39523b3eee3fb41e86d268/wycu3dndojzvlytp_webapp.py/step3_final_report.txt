  "purpose": "Manage PythonAnywhere web applications via API, including creation, deletion, reloading, SSL setup, static/media mappings, and log retrieval.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'API_TOKEN', user input for username, API responses from web requests, external API endpoints.",
  "sinks": "API endpoints for web app management, environment variables for credentials, API responses that may contain status or error messages.",
  "flows": "Source (API_TOKEN, environment variables) → API request functions → API responses → conditional logic and exception handling.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names, minimal error handling, dynamic URL construction, reliance on environment variables without explicit validation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard web app management tasks through API calls, using obfuscated identifiers which could be for concealment but are not inherently malicious. It fetches credentials from environment variables, which is common but should be secured. No hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads are present. Error handling is minimal and sometimes incomplete. The API interactions are typical for deployment automation. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or sabotage are evident. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate deployment and management utility for web applications, with obfuscation likely used for concealment but no evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. The low malware score is justified, and the overall security risk is low. Obfuscation should be monitored, but the code's purpose is consistent with standard web app management tasks.",
