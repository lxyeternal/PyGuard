  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate deployment and management utility for web applications, with obfuscation likely used for concealment but no evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. The low malware score is justified, and the overall security risk is low. Obfuscation should be monitored, but the code's purpose is consistent with standard web app management tasks."
