{
  "purpose": "Assigns a version string '0.2.4' to a variable with an obfuscated name, likely for internal or versioning purposes.",
  "sources": "The variable assignment itself; no external inputs or data sources involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows; the code does not process untrusted data or interact externally.",
  "flows": "Single source (variable assignment) with no data flow to other parts of code.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable name; no other anomalies or suspicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to an obfuscated variable name. No inputs, outputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present. The obfuscation appears intentional but does not indicate malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning a malware score of 0, high obfuscation score (~0.8), and very low security risk (~0.1). The absence of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities is consistent across analyses. The obfuscation is notable but not suspicious in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated variable assignment with no evidence of malicious activity or security threats. The high obfuscation score is justified, but overall, the snippet poses no security concern.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.8,
