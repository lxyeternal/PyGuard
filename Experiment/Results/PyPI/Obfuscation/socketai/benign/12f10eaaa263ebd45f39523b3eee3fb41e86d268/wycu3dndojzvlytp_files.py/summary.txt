  "conclusion": "The code functions as a remote file API client with significant obfuscation and some irregularities. While these raise suspicion, there is no concrete evidence of malicious intent or payloads. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware score remains low due to lack of explicit malicious activity. Overall security risk is moderate, primarily due to obfuscation and potential concealment, but no active threats are confirmed."
