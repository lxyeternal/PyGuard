  "purpose": "Python code interacts with an external API to list and delete student data, using obfuscated functions and current system username for user-specific requests.",
  "sources": "getpass.getuser() for username; external function pKOujZWScjSBphVzVDJxYIcFhPfbKFrj for API calls; response objects GgWjaNajWpTGRfKvUECNcfITULZOVyTt.",
  "sinks": "Response content included in exception messages; potential data leaks; network requests to external endpoints.",
  "flows": "Input from getpass.getuser() and student_username flows into URL construction and API calls; response objects flow into response handling and exception raising.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated function and variable names; references to undefined variables 'result' and 'detail' in exception messages; inconsistent variable usage; lack of input validation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs API interactions for listing and deleting students, relying on obfuscated external functions and system username. Exception messages include response content, risking data leakage. The code contains obfuscation and inconsistent variable references, indicating poor code quality or intentional concealment. No direct malicious activity (e.g., data exfiltration, backdoors) is evident. The obfuscation and potential info leaks are security concerns, but malware presence is not confirmed.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows high obfuscation and potential privacy leaks but lacks evidence of malicious payloads or malware. The security risk is moderate due to obfuscation and data leakage potential. Malware score is low, consistent with the absence of malicious activity. The overall risk score could be slightly increased to reflect privacy concerns, but current scores are appropriate.",
