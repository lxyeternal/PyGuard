  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for use in larger Python applications or modules.",
  "sources": "Class definitions that inherit from the built-in Exception class, with no input or data reading mechanisms.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output mechanisms; only class inheritance is used.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; classes are only definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Class names are obfuscated and do not reveal their purpose; no documentation or comments; no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation techniques beyond name mangling.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of several custom exception class definitions with obfuscated class names, all inheriting from Exception or other custom exceptions. No input reading, data leakage, network activity, or system modification is present. The obfuscated class names could be a simple attempt at concealment, but this alone is not suspicious. The code appears to be standard class inheritance with no malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code only defines custom exceptions with obfuscated names, which alone does not indicate malicious intent. There are no signs of malware, malicious data handling, or security risks. The obfuscation is superficial and likely intended to obscure class purposes, but does not pose a security threat.",
