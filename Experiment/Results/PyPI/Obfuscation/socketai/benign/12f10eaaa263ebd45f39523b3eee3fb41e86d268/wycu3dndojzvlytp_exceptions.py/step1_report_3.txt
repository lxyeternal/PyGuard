  "purpose": "Define multiple custom exception classes for use within a larger application or module.",
  "sources": "Class definitions for custom exceptions; no external data input sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow, as these are simply class definitions without execution or data processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "Exception class names are obfuscated with seemingly random, nonsensical strings; no functional behavior beyond class inheritance.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from Exception and other custom exceptions, with obfuscated class names. There are no input/output operations, no data processing, and no network or system calls. The naming pattern appears intentionally obscure, which can sometimes be suspicious, but without additional context, these are just custom exception class declarations. No malicious behavior or suspicious logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of custom exception class definitions with obfuscated names, likely used for internal error handling. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are evident.",
