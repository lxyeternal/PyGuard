  "anomalies": "Class names are obfuscated and appear as random strings, which can be suspicious. No meaningful or descriptive naming; no functionality beyond defining exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from Python's built-in Exception class and its subclasses. The class names are nonsensical and obfuscated, which is a common technique to hide malicious intent or to avoid detection. There is no actual logic, data handling, or external interaction. Such obfuscated exception classes might be used as part of a larger malicious payload to disguise malicious control flow or to hinder analysis. The lack of descriptive names and the absence of any functional code make this suspicious, but on their own, they do not perform any malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be obfuscated exception class definitions. While they do not perform any malicious actions on their own, the obfuscation and lack of context raise suspicion. They could be used to hide malicious behavior in a larger codebase. Without additional context or code, the malicious intent is uncertain but the obfuscation is noteworthy.",
