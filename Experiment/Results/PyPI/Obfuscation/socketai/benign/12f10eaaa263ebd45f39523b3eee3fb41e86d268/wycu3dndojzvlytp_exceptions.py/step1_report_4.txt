  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes, likely for use elsewhere in a larger program.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; class definitions are static.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; classes are merely defined.",
  "anomalies": "Class names are nonsensical or obfuscated, but no behavior indicates malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple class definitions inheriting from Python's built-in Exception class, with some classes extending other classes in the same file. The class names appear obfuscated or intentionally obscure, which can be suspicious in some contexts. However, these are just exception class definitions without any executable logic, data handling, or external interactions. There are no signs of data leakage, code injection, malicious actions, or suspicious behaviors. The only notable aspect is the use of non-descriptive, obfuscated class names, which could be an attempt to conceal intent but does not inherently imply malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code only defines custom exception classes with obfuscated names; there are no malicious or suspicious behaviors detected. It appears to be standard, albeit obscure, exception class definitions with no evident security risks.",
