{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests for coordinate processing functions imported from 'pyzbar.locations'. It validates coordinate transformations, sorting, and error handling.",
  "sources": "Input data are coordinate lists and tuples provided within test cases.",
  "sinks": "No external data, network, or file I/O; data flows are internal within test functions.",
  "flows": "Input coordinate data are processed by functions, with assertions verifying output; no external sinks or data leaks involved.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function and variable names, but no malicious code, secrets, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of unit tests validating coordinate-related functions. The obfuscation appears stylistic or for naming complexity, not malicious. No external data or network activity is present. The tests cover error handling, coordinate normalization, and geometric operations. No suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors are observed. The malware score is zero, consistent with the absence of malicious code. Obfuscation scores are moderate to high, justified by naming conventions but not indicative of malicious intent. Security risk is minimal, reflecting the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily obfuscated test code for coordinate processing functions. There is no evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or supply chain compromise. The obfuscation does not imply malicious intent, and the overall security posture is low risk.",
