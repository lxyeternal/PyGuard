  "purpose": "Unit tests for functions related to QR code location processing, specifically testing functions from the 'pyzbar.locations' module.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'pyzbar.locations', input data in test methods (lists, tuples), hardcoded test data.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly processes untrusted input, no data output or network communication, no file operations.",
  "flows": "Test data flows into functions from 'pyzbar.locations' with no untrusted data flow or external data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variable names, unusual test data, and function names that do not describe their purpose clearly; no secrets or hardcoded credentials.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of unit tests verifying behavior of functions likely related to QR code location processing. The functions tested handle coordinate data and perform geometric calculations. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network access, data exfiltration, or code injection. Obfuscated variable names appear to be deliberate obfuscation or placeholder names, but no malicious intent is inferred. The test data is consistent with geometric or spatial computations. No evidence of malicious payload, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The code is structured as standard unit tests with no external side effects.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of unit tests for a location-processing module, with obfuscated variable names but no malicious behavior or security risks detected. The overall security risk is minimal.",
