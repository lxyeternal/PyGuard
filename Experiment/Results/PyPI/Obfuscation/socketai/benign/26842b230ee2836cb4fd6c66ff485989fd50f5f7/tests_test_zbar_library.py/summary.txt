  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscation-heavy test suite for platform-dependent library loading in pyzbar.zbar_library. There is no evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or supply chain sabotage. The malware score is 0, and the risk score is very low (~0.1), with obfuscation at approximately 0.7 due to naming conventions. The overall security posture is safe."
