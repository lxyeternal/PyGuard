  "purpose": "Evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks based on static analysis and provided summaries.",
  "sources": "Code snippets, code comments, variable names, imported modules, network calls, environment variable usage, hardcoded secrets.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, data serialization, system commands, logging outputs.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input reading or environment variables to sinks like network or file operations, indicating potential data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, suspicious network domains, obfuscated code, unusual dynamic code execution, inconsistent variable naming, or logic that manipulates system files.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate no suspicious features, malicious patterns, or obfuscation based on high-level summaries. Malware scores are consistently zero, and security risk scores are low (0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal threat. Confidence levels are appropriate given the absence of actual code snippets. The reasoning across reports is cautious yet justified, with no anomalies detected. The scores are adjusted to reflect the lack of malicious indicators, and the overall assessment confirms benign behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency code appears benign with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. Security risks are minimal, and the confidence in this assessment is high. No modifications to scores are necessary.",
