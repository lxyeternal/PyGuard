  "purpose": "The code appears to perform some data processing or utility functions, but without specific context, its primary purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Data is read from environment variables, file inputs, or function parameters (exact sources not specified in the code snippet).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network requests, file writes, or system commands, but explicit details are not visible in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through various functions or processing steps toward output or side effects such as network communication or file modification.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code constructs, or obfuscated code are apparent. No unusual imports or functions are identified.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, performing typical processing tasks. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious network activity is evident. Without additional context or external interactions, the code seems benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no indication of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears standard and free from suspicious behaviors. However, limited visibility into external data sources or network activity constrains absolute certainty.",
