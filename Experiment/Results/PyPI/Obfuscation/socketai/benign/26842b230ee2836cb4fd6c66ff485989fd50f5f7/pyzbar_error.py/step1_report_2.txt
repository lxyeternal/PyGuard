  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class and specify an exception name in a list.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or potential data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only defines classes and variables.",
  "anomalies": "The class name 'qkJSLnKEPfRzGYOUDWVLqYKFjPsGTxOz' appears to be a nonsensical, obfuscated string, which is unusual for a class name. The list '__all__' only includes 'PyZbarError', which is unrelated to the class defined, indicating potential obfuscation or incomplete code structure. The code contains no functional logic or typical patterns of malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a list '__all__' with a single string 'PyZbarError', possibly indicating intended public API exports. It also defines an exception class with a very obfuscated name that inherits from Exception, but does not include any methods or additional code. The lack of functionality, combined with the obfuscated class name, raises suspicion about intentional concealment or obfuscation. There are no signs of malicious activity such as data theft, network activity, or harmful operations. The obfuscation appears superficial, perhaps for confusion or as a placeholder.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal and contains obfuscated class naming without any malicious behavior or security risks. The unusual class name and the discrepancy between the class name and the '__all__' list could suggest obfuscation or incomplete code, but no malicious intent is evident.",
