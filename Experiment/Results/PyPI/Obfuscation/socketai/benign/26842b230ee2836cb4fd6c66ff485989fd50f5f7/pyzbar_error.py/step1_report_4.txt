  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling specific errors, and list a module attribute.",
  "sources": "The list assignment to __all__, which specifies exported symbols; class definition of qkJSLnKEPfRzGYOUDWVLqYKFjPsGTxOz.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks or external data handling points.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines symbols and a class.",
  "anomalies": "The class name is a nonsensical, obfuscated string, which may indicate obfuscation or hiding intent; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a special exception class with a deliberately obscure name, likely to hide its purpose or prevent easy identification. The __all__ list only exposes this class name for module exports. No input reading, data handling, or external communication observed. The structure is minimal and does not include any malicious code or suspicious behavior beyond obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be an intentionally obfuscated minimal module defining a custom exception. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. The obscure class name could be an attempt to hide its purpose, but no malicious activity is indicated.",
