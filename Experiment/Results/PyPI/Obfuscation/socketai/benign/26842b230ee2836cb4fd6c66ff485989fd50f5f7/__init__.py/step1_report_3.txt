  "anomalies": "Use of a seemingly random string as a variable name; no context or usage shown.",
  "analysis": "The code only assigns a string '0.2.1' to a variable with an unusual name 'ZEDkSXtslvNCtDHrTHPSElvaIIdjGbPY'. There are no imports, no functions, no I/O operations, and no apparent malicious behavior. The variable name appears random or obfuscated, but without further context, it is not inherently malicious. The code does not exhibit typical malicious patterns such as network activity, code execution, or data exfiltration. The lone assignment is benign but unusual in naming conventions.\n\nGiven the minimal content, there's no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists solely of a variable assignment with an obfuscated variable name and a version string. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident based on this snippet alone.",
