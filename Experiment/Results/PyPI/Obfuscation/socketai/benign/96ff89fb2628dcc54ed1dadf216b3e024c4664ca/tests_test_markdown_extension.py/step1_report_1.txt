  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script intended for data processing or manipulation, possibly with network or file operations.",
  "sources": "Input data may be read from variables, function arguments, or external files. Specific source points are not explicitly shown in the code snippet provided.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, file writes, or data outputs. No explicit system or network actions are identified without detailed code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources through processing functions to sinks; specific paths cannot be confirmed without more detailed code.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are visible. The code structure and naming are typical; no obfuscation or unusual features detected.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed thoroughly, including the beginning, middle, and end. No malicious or suspicious behavior was identified. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard. No signs of code injection, data leakage, or insecure operations are evident.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with no suspicious patterns detected.",
