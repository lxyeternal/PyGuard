  "detailed_analysis": "The provided reports consistently indicate benign code with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The main concern arises from the use of 'eval' in one code snippet, which is inherently risky as it can be exploited for code injection if inputs are untrusted. While the reports correctly note the absence of malicious intent, the presence of 'eval' warrants elevating the security risk score to 0.3 to reflect potential danger. All other indicators—malware and obfuscation—remain at 0, aligning with the analysis. The confidence level for this assessment is high, given the consistent reasoning across reports and the known risks associated with 'eval'. This adjustment ensures the scores accurately represent the potential security concern without overestimating malicious intent.",
