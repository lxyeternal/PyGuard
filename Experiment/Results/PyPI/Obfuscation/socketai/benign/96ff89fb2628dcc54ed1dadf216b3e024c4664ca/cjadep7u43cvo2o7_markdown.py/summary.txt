  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for rendering terminal commands as HTML, with obfuscation and complex regex patterns that do not currently indicate malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0.7, risk=0.2-0.3) are justified. No evidence of malicious activity or backdoors is present."
