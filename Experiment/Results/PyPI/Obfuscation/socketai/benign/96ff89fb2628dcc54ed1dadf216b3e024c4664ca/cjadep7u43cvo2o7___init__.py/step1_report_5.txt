  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for data processing or utility functions, but the specific purpose cannot be determined definitively without additional context.",
  "sources": "Input data may be read from function arguments, file I/O, environment variables, or network connections (if present).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include data output functions, network transmissions, file writes, or system commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as user input, environment variables, or files to sinks such as output functions, network transmissions, or system modifications.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials or suspicious obfuscation. Unusual dynamic code execution or hidden backdoors are not evident from the provided code.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Python functions and libraries. There is no evidence of malicious intent such as sending system data over the network, connecting to suspicious domains, damaging files, or mining cryptocurrency. No suspicious patterns like obfuscated code or hardcoded secrets are detected. The code structure appears typical for legitimate utility functions. Without additional context or hidden mechanisms, the code seems benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or significant security risks. The code appears to be standard and does not include malicious or suspicious elements.",
