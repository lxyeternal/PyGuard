  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with low risk scores; Report 2 shows some suspicion but lacks confirmed malicious activity. Slightly increasing malware score in Report 2 to 0.4 and maintaining other scores ensures consistency. The overall security posture remains low risk, with cautious attention to obfuscation patterns."
