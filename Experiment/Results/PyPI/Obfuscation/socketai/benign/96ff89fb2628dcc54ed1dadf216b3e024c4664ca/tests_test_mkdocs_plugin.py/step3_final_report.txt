  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks based on static code analysis.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, stdin, external files or network sources; no explicit input functions shown.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks involve environment variables, file/network operations, or output functions that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (environment, stdin) to sinks (outputs, external sources), with no suspicious or malicious pathways identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns detected; code appears benign and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "All reports describe minimal or no code, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious activities. Scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the descriptions. High confidence levels (0.8-0.9) are justified given the static analysis. No anomalies or indicators of sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets analyzed are benign, with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk scores and zero malware scores are appropriate. Overall, the dependency appears safe for use.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
