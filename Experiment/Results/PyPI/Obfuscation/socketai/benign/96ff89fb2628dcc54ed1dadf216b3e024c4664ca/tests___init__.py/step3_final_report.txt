{
  "purpose": "Analyze open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Code snippets, variable assignments, input/output points, dynamic code segments, obfuscated identifiers.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, data serialization, system commands.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input or environment variables flow into processing functions; outputs or network calls act as sinks, potential data exfiltration points.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation scores without concrete malicious payloads, minimal or absent code, inconsistent malware scoring relative to evidence, hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns not explicitly identified.",
  "analysis": "Most reports indicate minimal or no code, with appropriate low scores. Report 2 describes complex, obfuscated code with moderate suspicion; the malware score of 0.2 is slightly high given no direct malicious activity. Adjusting this to 0.15 aligns better with the evidence. Other reports are consistent with their descriptions, showing no significant risks. The overall assessment suggests low malware and security risks, with some suspicion in obfuscated code but no confirmed malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The reports are generally accurate; minor score adjustments improve consistency. No evidence of malicious activity or high security risk is present. The code appears benign or unverified, with obfuscation raising moderate concern in one case.",
