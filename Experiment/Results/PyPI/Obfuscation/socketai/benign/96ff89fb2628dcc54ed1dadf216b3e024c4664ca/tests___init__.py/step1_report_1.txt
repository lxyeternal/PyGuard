  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to involve importing modules and potentially handling data or network operations.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from imported modules, environment variables, or external sources (not explicitly shown).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or data transmission points (not explicitly shown).",
  "flows": "Untrusted data could flow from input sources through processing functions to sinks such as network or file system, but specific flow paths are not detailed due to the absence of explicit code.",
  "anomalies": "The code provided is empty or minimal, with no visible suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated sections. No unusual language features or dynamic code execution are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet is empty or lacks implementation details, making it impossible to identify sources, sinks, or suspicious behaviors. Without actual code, assessment relies on absence of observable malicious patterns or obfuscation. No anomalies or malicious indicators are present in the visible fragment.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code appears benign but incomplete for a thorough review. Confidence in this assessment is limited due to lack of actual code content.",
