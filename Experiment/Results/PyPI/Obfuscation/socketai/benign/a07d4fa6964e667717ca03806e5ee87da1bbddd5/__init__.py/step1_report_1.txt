  "purpose": "Import a module or class from a relative package and define a version string.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .client",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data handling or output",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink; import is static and version assignment is straightforward",
  "anomalies": "Unusual naming of the imported class (random string), but no malicious activity evident",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class or object with a non-descriptive, seemingly random name from a local module. It then defines a version string. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code execution, or backdoors. The import name does not follow standard naming conventions, which could be suspicious, but alone does not indicate malicious intent. The code is minimal and does not perform any dynamic operations, network activity, or data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign module import and version declaration with no malicious intent or security risks identified. The unusual naming is suspicious but not indicative of malicious behavior on its own.",
