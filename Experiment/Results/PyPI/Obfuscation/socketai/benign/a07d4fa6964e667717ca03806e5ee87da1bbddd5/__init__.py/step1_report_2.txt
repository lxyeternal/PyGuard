{
  "purpose": "Import a specific class or function from a local module named 'client' and define a version string.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .client, reading the 'client' module.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no untrusted data handling or external data output present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the import source into the namespace; no further flow to sinks or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "The imported name 'BKPZHLDiOnjFZkaVKoOkCqPcaoFdkqjK' appears to be a nonsensical, randomly generated identifier, which could indicate obfuscation or malicious intent. The version string is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module component with a seemingly random or obfuscated name, which could be indicative of malicious intent or obfuscation. The version string is standard. No other code, functions, or logic are present. There are no obvious malicious behaviors such as network calls, data leaks, or backdoors. However, the unusual import name warrants caution as it could be a sign of obfuscation or hidden functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal and does not exhibit direct malicious behavior. The unusual import name may suggest obfuscation or hidden intentions, but with the given code alone, there is no concrete evidence of malicious activity. It warrants further review if part of a larger codebase.",
