{
  "purpose": "Import a class or function from a local module named 'client' and define a version string",
  "sources": "Import statement from .client, assignment of version string",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data handling or external communication",
  "flows": "No data flow from input to output; the code only performs a static import and variable assignment",
  "anomalies": "Unusual naming of imported class/function (BKPZHLDiOnjFZkaVKoOkCqPcaoFdkqjK), which could be obfuscated or malicious, but no evidence of malicious intent is present in this snippet",
  "analysis": "The code imports a potentially obfuscated identifier from a local module, which could be used to hide malicious behavior. The version string appears standard. There is no indication of data exfiltration, dynamic code execution, or external network activity. The import and assignment are static and do not involve any external input or untrusted sources. Given the minimal content, no malicious behavior or security issues are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and appears to perform standard import and assignment operations, with no evident malicious intent. The unusual import name warrants caution, but on its own, it does not indicate malicious behavior.",
