  "purpose": "Import a class/object from a local module and define a version string.",
  "sources": "Static import statement from .client module, assignment of version string.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data sources present.",
  "flows": "Import statement and version assignment are static; no data flow or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated import name 'BKPZHLDiOnjFZkaVKoOkCqPcaoFdkqjK' appears suspicious but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting of a static import and a version string assignment. No dynamic code, network activity, or data exfiltration is evident. The import name is obfuscated, which could be used to hide malicious intent, but no evidence supports malicious behavior. Malware score is set to 0, consistent with the absence of malicious activity. Obfuscation score is moderate due to the import name's appearance. Risk score is low, reflecting minimal threat but acknowledging the suspicious naming. Overall, the code appears benign, with obfuscation as the primary concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with an obfuscated import name that warrants cautious review but shows no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. Scores are set accordingly, with malware at 0, obfuscation moderate, and low risk.",
