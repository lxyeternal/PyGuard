{
  "purpose": "The code appears to import a specific class or function from a local module named 'client' and defines a version string.",
  "sources": "The import statement reading from '.client', which is a relative module, and the assignment of a version string.",
  "sinks": "The code does not directly write to files, send data over network, or handle untrusted input/output explicitly.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is present; the import is static, and the version string is hardcoded.",
  "anomalies": "The imported class/function has an obfuscated or nonsensical name (BKPZHLDiOnjFZkaVKoOkCqPcaoFdkqjK), which could be an attempt at hiding functionality. No other suspicious code or behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple import of a class/function from a local module and sets a version string. The import name appears obfuscated, which might be intended to conceal malicious functionality or to make reverse engineering difficult. However, without additional context or implementation details, there is no clear evidence of malicious behavior. The code is minimal and does not interact with external systems, network, or sensitive data.\n\nOverall, the code's structure is straightforward but the obfuscated import name warrants caution as it could be part of a larger malicious package. Due to lack of additional code, the risk is limited but not negligible.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal with an obfuscated import, which could be a sign of hiding malicious intent. There is no direct evidence of malicious behavior in this snippet alone, but the obfuscation warrants further review of the complete package.",
