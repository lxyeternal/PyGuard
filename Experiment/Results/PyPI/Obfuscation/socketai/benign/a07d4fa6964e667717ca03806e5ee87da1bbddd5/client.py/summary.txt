  "conclusion": "The code is a complex, obfuscated API client wrapper that does not exhibit any evidence of malicious activity. The high obfuscation score warrants caution, but based on this static analysis, the malware risk is low. Further dynamic or runtime analysis would be necessary to confirm benign intent."
