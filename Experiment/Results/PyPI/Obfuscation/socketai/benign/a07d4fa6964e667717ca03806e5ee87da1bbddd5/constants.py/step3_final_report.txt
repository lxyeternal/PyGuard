{
  "purpose": "The code consists of static configuration data structures for API management, resource schemas, and templates, with no dynamic behavior or active malicious code.",
  "sources": "These are static dictionaries defining configuration schemas, resource definitions, and API specifications; no external data sources or runtime input.",
  "sinks": "No data flows or external outputs; static data structures with no active data transmission or processing.",
  "flows": "None; all data is static and predefined, with no source-to-sink data flows.",
  "anomalies": "Repeated use of 'insecure_skip_verify': 'true' in annotations, which disables SSL verification, representing insecure configuration but not malicious activity. Placeholder values (None, empty strings) suggest templates, not secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely static configuration data with no functions, dynamic code, or network activity. The presence of 'insecure_skip_verify' flags indicates insecure SSL settings, which pose security risks but do not constitute malware. No obfuscation or malicious logic is present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk~0.2-0.3) are appropriate given the context. The configuration's insecurity should be addressed but does not imply malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign static configuration data with no malware or obfuscation. The main security concern is the insecure SSL verification setting, which should be corrected in deployment but does not indicate malicious activity.",
