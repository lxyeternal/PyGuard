  "purpose": "Import Windows Runtime components related to UI input handling, specifically PalmRejectionDelayZonePreview.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'winrt.system' and 'winrt._winrt_windows_ui_input_inking_preview.PalmRejectionDelayZonePreview'.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data output.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only imports modules and defines __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and export setup with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of import statements and an __all__ declaration. It interacts only with Windows Runtime APIs for UI input features. No data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The imports are standard for Windows applications, and there are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The malware score is appropriately 0, the obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is negligible (~0.1), reflecting the benign nature of the code. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module import setup for Windows Runtime UI input features, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risk. All scores should be set to 0 for malware and obfuscation, and a very low value (~0.1) for security risk to reflect minimal concern. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety.",
