  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class with an abstract asynchronous method that takes two string parameters and returns a string.",
  "sources": "Class definition and method declaration",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no untrusted data handling or output",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis possible; method is abstract and contains no implementation",
  "anomalies": "Class and method names are nonsensical, which may suggest obfuscation. No actual code logic present. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious imports.",
  "analysis": "The code declares an abstract class with a single abstract async method, both named with seemingly random strings. The class and method names do not reveal any functional purpose, which could be an attempt to obfuscate intent. There is no implementation, no data processing, and no external communication or side effects. This code by itself does not contain malicious behavior but might be part of an obfuscated package. Since it's only an abstract class, it does not perform any actions or pose security risks directly.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be an obfuscated or placeholder abstract class with no executable logic or malicious behavior. Its purpose is unclear due to nonsensical naming, but it does not contain malware or security risks in its current form.",
