  "purpose": "Define an abstract interface with an async method returning a list of strings.",
  "sources": "None; the code is a class and method declaration without data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow, external interactions, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows exist in this code.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names, but no executable logic, data handling, or malicious indicators.",
  "analysis": "The code is a purely structural abstract class with an abstract method, exhibiting high obfuscation but no runtime logic or data flow. No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities are present. The high obfuscation scores are justified by nonsensical naming, but this alone does not imply malicious intent. The malware score remains at 0, and the security risk is minimal, reflecting the benign nature of the code as an interface placeholder.",
  "conclusion": "The code is an obfuscated interface definition with no malicious activity or security issues. The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not indicate malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's characteristics.",
