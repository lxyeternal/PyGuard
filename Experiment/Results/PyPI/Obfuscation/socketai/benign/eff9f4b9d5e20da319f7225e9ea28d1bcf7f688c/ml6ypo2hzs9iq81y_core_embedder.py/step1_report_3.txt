  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class with asynchronous methods for processing text data into numerical lists.",
  "sources": "None explicitly; the code only defines an abstract class and method signatures.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or output is performed within this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs in this abstract class as it contains only method signatures without implementation.",
  "anomalies": "The class and method names are intentionally obfuscated, but this alone is not suspicious. No hardcoded secrets or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class with two asynchronous abstract methods intended to process text data into floating-point number lists. No implementation is provided, making it impossible to determine specific behavior. The obfuscated class and method names suggest either code obfuscation or placeholder naming but do not directly indicate malicious intent. There are no signs of data leakage, external communication, or malicious logic within this fragment. It appears to be a standard interface definition, possibly for a larger application or library.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a non-malicious abstract class definition with obfuscated identifiers. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues within this snippet. Its purpose seems to be to define an interface for future implementations.",
