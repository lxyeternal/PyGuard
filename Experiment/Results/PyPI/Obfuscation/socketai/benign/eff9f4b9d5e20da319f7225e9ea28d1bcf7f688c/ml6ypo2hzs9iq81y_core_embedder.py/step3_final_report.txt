  "purpose": "Defines an abstract base class with asynchronous methods for processing text into numerical data.",
  "sources": "Method signatures accepting input text and lists of texts.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "No actual data flow; methods are unimplemented.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names, no implementation or logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a purely abstract interface with obfuscated naming, lacking concrete logic, data handling, or external calls. The obfuscation pattern is consistent and high, which could be suspicious but is not inherently malicious. No signs of malicious code, payloads, or data exfiltration are present. The malware score is appropriately zero; the security risk is low due to the absence of active behavior. The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not indicate malicious intent in isolation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated interface definition with no evidence of malicious activity. While obfuscation can sometimes hide malicious code, in this context, it appears to be a simple interface with no active threats. The scores are consistent and justified based on the evidence.",
