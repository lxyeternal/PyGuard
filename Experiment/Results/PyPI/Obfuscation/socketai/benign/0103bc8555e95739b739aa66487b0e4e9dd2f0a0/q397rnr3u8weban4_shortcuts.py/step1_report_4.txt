  "purpose": "Assign variables from imported module attributes, possibly for later use",
  "sources": "Import statement from '.notation', accessing attributes of 'nrJJNbEHzKaCuCfTwaXgOilYmHsynjYo' and other imported attributes",
  "sinks": "Assignment to local variables, no untrusted data sources or output functions identified",
  "flows": "Imported attributes -> local variables; no external or untrusted data flow observed",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated, nonsensical variable and attribute names; no clear purpose; no explicit code execution, network activity, or data handling observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module 'notation' and assigns its attributes, which have obfuscated names, to local variables with similarly obscure names. There are no functions, input/output operations, or explicit security-sensitive operations. The variable 'B' is set to 'business', which might be a placeholder or part of a larger code context. The obfuscation and lack of meaningful identifiers could suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent, but on its own, this snippet only shows obfuscated variable assignments with no direct malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be highly obfuscated with no clear malicious behavior or security risks demonstrated in this snippet. It may be part of a larger, potentially malicious, program, but this fragment alone does not show active malicious actions or security vulnerabilities.",
