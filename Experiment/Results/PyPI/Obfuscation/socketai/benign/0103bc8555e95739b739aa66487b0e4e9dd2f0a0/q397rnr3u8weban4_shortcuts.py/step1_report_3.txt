{
  "purpose": "Assign variables by importing and referencing functions or data from a local module",
  "sources": "Import statement importing symbols from .notation module; variable assignments from imported symbols",
  "sinks": "Variable assignments from imported symbols; no untrusted data sources or sinks present",
  "flows": "Imported symbols are assigned to local variables directly; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks",
  "anomalies": "Use of seemingly obfuscated variable names; no clear indication of malicious intent; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific symbols from a local module called .notation and assigns these imported symbols to new variables. The variable names appear obfuscated or auto-generated, which could be an attempt to hide intent. The variable 'B' is assigned the value 'business', which seems benign. There are no signs of data exfiltration, network activity, or malicious operations. The code is straightforward, simply importing and assigning symbols without any conditional logic, function calls, or external interactions that could indicate malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a simple import and assignment routine, likely part of a larger program. There are no suspicious behaviors, malicious code, or security risks evident in this fragment. The obfuscated variable names are not inherently malicious but suggest that the code might be auto-generated or intentionally obscured. Overall, the code does not pose any immediate security threats.",
