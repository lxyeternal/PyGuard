{
  "purpose": "The code imports variables with obfuscated names from a local module and assigns them to new variables, with a benign string assignment to 'B'.",
  "sources": "Imports from .notation module; variable assignments; assignment of 'business' to B.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks or external effects observed.",
  "flows": "Imported variables flow directly into new variables; no data processing or external communication occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated variable names; no functional logic; potential obfuscation but no malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code solely performs import and assignment operations with obfuscated variable names, indicating obfuscation but no malicious intent. No network, file, or environment interactions are present. The obfuscation could be to hide intent but does not inherently imply malicious behavior. Scores reflect high obfuscation (around 0.8), but malware and security risks are minimal (scores near 0). The code's simplicity and lack of malicious patterns support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is obfuscated but benign, with no evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware and risk scores remain low. Overall, the dependency appears safe, and no remedial action is necessary.",
