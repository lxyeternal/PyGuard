{
  "purpose": "This code appears to perform statistical analysis on a transformed input dataset, calculating mean and median values after applying a transformation function to the data.",
  "sources": "The code reads data through the input parameter 'values' in the functions, which are then transformed via imported functions and sorted.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs statistical measures (mean, median, min, max) but does not directly write or transmit untrusted data outside its scope.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'values' input through transformation functions, then to statistical calculations (mean, median, min, max). The transformation functions process the data, and results are derived from these processed datasets.",
  "anomalies": "The imported functions 'XvGDdVaVVkTYKUQJEKdAkMHbQkXLxmAK' and 'WifyQPbFEDbIwiyRvUyvuJzHxurnXgXi' have obfuscated names, which may suggest concealment. The code performs non-obvious data transformations before statistical calculations, which could be a way to hide malicious behavior or obfuscate intent. There is no explicit hardcoded credential or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two obfuscated functions and uses them to process input data, transforming the data, sorting it, and calculating statistical measures like mean and median at specified percentiles. The transformations could be benign but also could serve to obscure malicious intent, such as hiding data exfiltration or malicious data manipulation. No network, file, or system modifications are evident, and no explicit malicious actions are performed within this fragment. The obfuscated function names and complex flow suggest potential obfuscation but not necessarily malicious behavior. Overall, the code performs standard statistical analysis with some obfuscation that warrants further review.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily for statistical data processing with obfuscated functions that could be used for concealment. There are no direct signs of malicious actions or malware in this fragment, but the obfuscation and transformation functions should be reviewed further for intent.",
