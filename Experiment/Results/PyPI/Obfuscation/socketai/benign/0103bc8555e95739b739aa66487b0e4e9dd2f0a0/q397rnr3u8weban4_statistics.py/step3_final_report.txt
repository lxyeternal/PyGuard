  "purpose": "Performs statistical analysis (mean, median, quartiles) on data transformed by external obfuscated functions.",
  "sources": "Input data passed to functions, external functions `XvGDdVaVVkTYKUQJEKdAkMHbQkXLxmAK` and `WifyQPbFEDbIwiyRvUyvuJzHxurnXgXi` used for data transformation.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no network, file, or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Input data -> external transformation functions -> statistical calculations (mean, median, quartiles).",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of function and variable names; reliance on external functions with unknown behavior; no clear malicious activity but potential concealment.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard statistical calculations on data transformed by two heavily obfuscated external functions. No network or system modifications are present. The obfuscation and external dependencies are suspicious but do not directly indicate malicious intent. The malware score is low (around 0.2), reflecting no concrete malicious actions, while the obfuscation score is high (~0.75). The overall security risk is moderate (~0.3), primarily due to obfuscation concerns. The code's logic appears correct and consistent, but further analysis of the external functions is recommended to rule out malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits significant obfuscation and relies on external functions, which warrants caution. However, there is no direct evidence of malicious activity in this fragment. The low malware score and moderate risk score are appropriate, but further investigation into the external dependencies is advised before deployment.",
