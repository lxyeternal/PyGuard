{
  "purpose": "The code calculates statistical measures (mean and quantiles) of a data set after processing the data through a custom transformation function.",
  "sources": "Data is read from the 'values' parameter passed to the functions, which is then processed by external functions imported from a local utils module.",
  "sinks": "Results of statistical calculations are returned directly; no external sinks or data transmission observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input 'values', through transformation and sorting, then to statistical calculations like mean and quantiles.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable and function names, external transformation functions, and indirect median/quantile calculations without clear context. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are evident. No network or file operations are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs statistical calculations, specifically mean and quantile estimations, on data processed through an imported transformation function. The use of obfuscated identifiers suggests an attempt to conceal intent or functionality. External functions are used to transform data, which could potentially be malicious if the imported module is compromised, but there's no direct evidence of malicious behavior in this snippet. The calculations themselves are standard statistical operations. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or malicious system modifications are present. The obfuscation level and indirect data processing raise some suspicion, but the core operations are benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to perform statistical analysis on transformed data. While the obfuscation and external dependencies warrant caution, there is no explicit malicious behavior or malware observed in this code snippet. It appears to be a potentially obfuscated statistical utility with no evident security threats.",
