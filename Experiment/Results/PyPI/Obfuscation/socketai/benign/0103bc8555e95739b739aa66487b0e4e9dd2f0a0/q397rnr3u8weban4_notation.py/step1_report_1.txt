{
  "purpose": "The code provides various utility functions for mathematical and statistical computations, formatting, and number conversions, likely used for data analysis or visualization tasks.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters, external modules (e.g., pandas, math, decimal), and imported utility functions. It also reads data from the 'statistics' module and environment variables or external libraries in some functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include data formatting functions, string replacements, and conversions that may be used to process untrusted data; however, no direct data leaks or external communications are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through calculations, conversions, and formatting functions, with some logic potentially manipulating data for display or further processing, but no external or untrusted data flow outside the local scope is explicitly evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains obfuscated or nonsensical variable and function names, use of decorators that may alter function behavior, and imported functions that are not clearly defined, which may suggest obfuscation. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are detected. Use of arbitrary mathematical functions and decimal precision adjustments appear normal for data processing.",
  "analysis": "The functions primarily perform mathematical transformations, statistical calculations, and data formatting. The use of obfuscated names and decorators suggests intentional concealment of code intent, possibly to evade detection. There is no evidence of malicious network activity, data exfiltration, or system tampering. The functions seem designed for legitimate data analysis tasks, with no suspicious external communications or harmful operations. The obfuscation could be an attempt to hide malicious intent, but given the actual logic, the code appears to be normal data processing code, albeit with confusing naming.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a collection of data processing utilities with obfuscated naming, but no explicit malicious behavior, external network activity, or sabotage mechanisms are identified. The obfuscation warrants caution, but based on the logic, it is likely legitimate data analysis code.",
