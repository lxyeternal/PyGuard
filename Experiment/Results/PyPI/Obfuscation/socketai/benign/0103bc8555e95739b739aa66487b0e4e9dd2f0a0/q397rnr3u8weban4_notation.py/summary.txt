  "conclusion": "The code is most likely benign, serving as utility functions for data processing. Despite heavy obfuscation, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The malware score should remain at 0, with a high obfuscation score justified by the naming complexity. Overall security risk is low. No modifications to the scores are necessary."
