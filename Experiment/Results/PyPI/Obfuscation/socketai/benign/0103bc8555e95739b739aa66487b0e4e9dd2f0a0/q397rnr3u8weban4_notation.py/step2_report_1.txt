  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the actual code provided.\n\n---\n\n**General observations about the code:**\n\n- The code contains numerous functions performing statistical calculations, number formatting, normalization, and conversions.\n- Many variable and function names are obfuscated or nonsensical, which suggests intentional concealment.\n- External modules like pandas, decimal, and math are used, but their usage appears standard.\n- Decorators are applied to some functions, but their purposes are unclear without their definitions.\n- No network activity, file I/O, or external system calls are visible.\n- The code appears to be utility functions for data analysis or visualization.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n\n- **Obfuscation:** The variable and function names are heavily obfuscated, which hampers readability and maintainability. This is suspicious but not inherently malicious.\n- **Potential for malicious intent:** No direct evidence of malicious behavior (e.g., network calls, data exfiltration, backdoors) is present.\n- **Use of decorators:** Decorators are applied, but their behavior is unknown. If they modify functions to conceal malicious behavior, that could be concerning, but there's no evidence here.\n- **Imported functions:** Some imported functions (e.g., from `.utils`) have unclear purposes, but their usage seems consistent with data processing.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is complex and obfuscated but appears to be legitimate utility functions for data processing, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose:** Utility functions for data analysis, formatting, conversions.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Inputs from parameters, no external data leaks.\n- **Anomalies:** Obfuscated names, decorators, unclear imported functions.\n- **Analysis:** Functions perform standard math/statistics; obfuscation may be to hide intent but no malicious activity detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Likely legitimate data analysis code, obfuscation warrants caution but no evidence of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (correct)  \n  - Security risk: 0.2 (reasonable)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0.7 (appropriate given the obfuscation)  \n  - Overall risk: low, reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose:** Numerical analysis, formatting, normalization.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** No external data leaks, safe formatting.\n- **Anomalies:** Obfuscated names, decorators, unclear imported functions.\n- **Analysis:** Same as above, no malicious behavior, just obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, benign code.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (correct)  \n  - Security risk: 0.2 (reasonable)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0.8 (high but justified)  \n  - Overall risk: low, reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose:** Numerical/statistical utilities, formatting.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Inputs processed through standard functions.\n- **Anomalies:** Obfuscated names, import names, decorators.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity, functions perform standard calculations.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent, obfuscation for concealment.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (correct)  \n  - Security risk: 0.2 (reasonable)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0.8 (appropriate)  \n  - Overall risk: low, reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose:** Statistical, numerical, formatting functions.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Data processed through calculations and formatting.\n- **Anomalies:** Obfuscated names, import names, decorators.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, utility functions for data processing.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (correct)  \n  - Security risk: 0.2 (reasonable)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0.8 (appropriate)  \n  - Overall risk: low, reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose:** Data processing utilities.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Inputs and formatting, no external leaks.\n- **Anomalies:** Obfuscated names, unclear imports, decorators.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Utility functions, safe.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (correct)  \n  - Security risk: 0.2 (reasonable)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0.7 (appropriate)  \n  - Overall risk: low, reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of scoring consistency:**\n\n- All reports assign a **malware score of 0**, which aligns with the analysis that no malicious activity is evident.\n- The **obfuscated score** is high (~0.7-0.8), justified by the heavily obfuscated variable and function names.\n- The **security risk** is consistently low (~0.2), as the code performs standard data processing with no external threats.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n- The code is obfuscated but appears to be legitimate utility functions for data analysis.\n- No evidence of malware, malicious payloads, or sabotage.\n- The obfuscation could be an attempt to hide complexity or proprietary logic, not necessarily malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **My recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0.75** — high obfuscation, but justified.\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** — low security risk, standard data processing.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent with my analysis. The code is likely benign, with obfuscation as the main concern. No changes to the scores are necessary unless further context reveals malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always review the context in which such code is used. If integrated into a larger system, ensure no external dependencies or behaviors could introduce risks.",
