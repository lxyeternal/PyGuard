{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for statistical analysis, number formatting, normalization, and data processing, primarily for data analysis tasks.",
  "sources": "Input data from function parameters, external modules (pandas, decimal, math), and imported utility functions.",
  "sinks": "Internal data flows within functions; no external data leaks, network activity, or file I/O observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through calculations, formatting, and normalization functions, with no external sinks or network calls.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of variable and function names, use of decorators without clear purpose, and imported functions with unclear definitions; no malicious payloads or suspicious external interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard statistical and numerical operations, formatting, and normalization routines. Obfuscation appears to be for concealment rather than malicious intent. No network activity, data exfiltration, or system tampering is evident. The heavy obfuscation justifies a higher obfuscated score but does not indicate malicious behavior. The malware score remains at 0, consistent with the absence of malicious indicators. Security risk is low (~0.2), given the benign nature of the functions. The code seems to be legitimate utility functions for data analysis with obfuscation as a concealment measure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is most likely benign, serving as utility functions for data processing. Despite heavy obfuscation, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The malware score should remain at 0, with a high obfuscation score justified by the naming complexity. Overall security risk is low. No modifications to the scores are necessary.",
