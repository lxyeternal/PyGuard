  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code and the provided assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code is utility functions for data analysis, with input data from parameters, external modules, and imported functions. No issues here.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks or network activity; data flows are internal and straightforward.\n- **Anomalies:** Obfuscated variable and function names, decorators that may alter behavior, imported functions with unclear definitions—these are typical signs of obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The functions perform mathematical/statistical calculations, formatting, and normalization. Obfuscation could be to hide malicious intent, but the logic appears legitimate. No external communications or system tampering are evident.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** The report assigns a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity. Security risk is low (0.2). The obfuscation score (0.7) is reasonable given the obfuscated names and decorators.\n- **Score adjustments:** No changes needed; the assessment is consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar utility functions for numerical analysis and formatting, with input from parameters and modules.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No network or file system activity; data flows are internal.\n- **Anomalies:** Obfuscated variable names, imported functions with unclear names, decorators—again, signs of obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Functions perform standard calculations, formatting, and normalization. No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware score is 0, matching the analysis. Obfuscation score (0.8) is slightly higher but acceptable due to obfuscated naming.\n- **Score adjustments:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions for numerical processing, with data from function parameters, pandas, etc.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks or malicious sinks.\n- **Anomalies:** Obfuscated names, complex code structure, but no malicious activity.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Similar to previous reports, standard numerical and formatting functions, obfuscation likely for concealment.\n- **Scores:** Malware score 0, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior. Obfuscation at 0.8 is justified.\n- **Score adjustments:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Statistical and numerical utility functions, similar to previous.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external communication or malicious sinks.\n- **Anomalies:** Obfuscated names, heavy obfuscation, but no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Focused on data processing, no network or system tampering.\n- **Scores:** Malware score 0, appropriate.\n- **Score adjustments:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions for data processing, similar pattern.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or malicious data flows.\n- **Anomalies:** Obfuscated names, but functions perform standard calculations.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, obfuscation likely for concealment.\n- **Scores:** Malware score 0, consistent.\n- **Score adjustments:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Analysis:** The code consists of various utility functions for statistical calculations, number formatting, normalization, and data processing. All reports note obfuscated variable and function names, which could be an attempt at concealment.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** No evidence of malicious activity, external network calls, data exfiltration, or sabotage mechanisms. The malware scores of 0 across all reports are justified.\n- **Obfuscation:** The obfuscation scores are high (~0.7-0.8), which is reasonable given the naming and decorators, but this alone does not imply malicious intent.\n- **Risk Scores:** The overall security risk remains low (~0.2), as the functions are typical data processing utilities.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification and Recommendations:\n\n- The functions appear to be legitimate utility routines for statistical and numerical data handling.\n- The obfuscation is a concern but not indicative of malicious intent based on the code logic.\n- No external or internal malicious behaviors are detected.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---|---|---|\n| **0.0** | **0.7** | **0.2** |\n\nThese align with the provided reports and the detailed analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a set of data processing utilities with obfuscated names, but no malicious behavior or security threats are evident. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not justify a higher malware or risk score.",
