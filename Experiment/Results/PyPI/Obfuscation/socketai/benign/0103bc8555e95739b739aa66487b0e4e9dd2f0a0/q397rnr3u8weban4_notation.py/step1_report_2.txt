{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for numerical analysis, formatting, and data normalization, likely for scientific or data processing applications.",
  "sources": "Input data from function arguments, environment variables (if any indirectly), and imported modules; no explicit external data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include data formatting functions, pandas Series creation, and string replacements, which are safe. No network or file system interactions are directly observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arguments through calculations, formatting, and normalization functions; no suspicious data flows to external systems or sensitive data leaks are evident.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated-looking variable names; import of modules and functions with unclear or auto-generated names; the presence of decorators with unclear purpose; functions performing formatting and normalization without obvious security concerns; no hardcoded secrets or credentials; no code injection points or external system calls.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a collection of utility functions for mathematical calculations, number formatting, and data normalization. It employs obfuscated variable and function names, possibly for code concealment but not necessarily malicious intent. There are no network calls, file operations, or other common malicious behaviors. The functions utilize safe libraries such as decimal, math, and pandas if available. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external interactions are detected. The obfuscation seems intentional for code concealment rather than malicious activity. The code's structure and usage are consistent with legitimate numerical processing tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a set of utility functions for numerical and data formatting purposes, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscated variable names are likely for concealment but do not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code seems safe and benign.",
