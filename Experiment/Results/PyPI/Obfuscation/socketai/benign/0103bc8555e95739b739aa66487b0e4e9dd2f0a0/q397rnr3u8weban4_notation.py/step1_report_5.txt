{
  "purpose": "The code provides various utility functions for statistical calculations, number formatting, and data normalization, likely for data analysis or visualization purposes.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are function arguments such as numerical values, statistical results, and data series; external modules like pandas for data manipulation.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include string formatting for display, file or network transmission if integrated elsewhere, but none are explicitly present in this code segment.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arguments into statistical or mathematical functions, then into formatting or conversion functions, with some functions calling external libraries (pandas) for data type handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks are present. The code uses obfuscated import names, but these are consistent with standard practices. The functions primarily perform calculations and formatting without side effects.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a collection of utility functions for numerical computations, formatting, and statistical processing. Functions like OquDzSurjpMtEAFaLSYWkblmVCJISJQy perform logarithmic calculations with validation, while others format numbers or convert data types. Obfuscated names could suggest intentional difficulty in understanding, but the logic is straightforward. No signs of malicious code such as network activity, system manipulation, or data exfiltration are evident. The use of external libraries like pandas is conditional and for data handling, not for malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a set of data processing utilities with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. Its obfuscated naming may hinder readability but does not indicate malicious intent. Overall security risk is minimal; it appears safe but should be reviewed in broader context for usage.",
