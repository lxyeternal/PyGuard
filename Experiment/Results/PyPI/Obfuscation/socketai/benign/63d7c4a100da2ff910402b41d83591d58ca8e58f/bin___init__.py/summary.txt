  "conclusion": "The scores for reports 1 and 2 are justified and consistent with their analyses, indicating moderate to high suspicion of malicious activity primarily due to obfuscation and suspicious behaviors. Reports 3-5 correctly reflect absence of code. Overall, the dependency exhibits signs of obfuscation and potential malicious intent, warranting further investigation. The estimated overall malware score is approximately 0.5, obfuscation at 0.7, and security risk at 0.65."
