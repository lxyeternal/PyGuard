  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows identified; the code does not process or transfer data.",
  "anomalies": "The code is empty or lacks content, suggesting it might be a placeholder or incomplete. No suspicious or unusual code patterns are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provided is essentially empty with no functional content. No functions, imports, or executable statements are present. Without code logic, there are no apparent security issues, data flows, or malicious behaviors. Its structure does not indicate obfuscation, malware, or suspicious activity. The absence of code means it cannot perform any malicious actions or leak information.",
  "conclusion": "The code is inactive or incomplete, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a placeholder or template rather than functional code. Therefore, no security concerns are identified based on the provided content.",
