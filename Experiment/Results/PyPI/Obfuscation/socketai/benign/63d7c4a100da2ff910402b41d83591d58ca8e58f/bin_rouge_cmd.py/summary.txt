  "conclusion": "The code functions as a legitimate Rouge evaluation tool but is heavily obfuscated, which could be benign or malicious concealment. No active malicious activity is evident from static analysis. The malware score is set to 0.2 reflecting suspicion due to obfuscation, but no concrete malicious behavior is detected. The overall security risk is moderate (0.3), primarily due to obfuscation and syntax irregularities. Further dynamic analysis and source verification are recommended before deployment or trust in unverified environments."
