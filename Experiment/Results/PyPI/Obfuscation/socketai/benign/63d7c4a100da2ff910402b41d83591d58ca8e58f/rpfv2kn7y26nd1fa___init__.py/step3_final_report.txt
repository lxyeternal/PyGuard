{
  "purpose": "This code imports two functions with obfuscated names from the 'rouge_chinese.rouge' package, defines a version string, and specifies exported symbols.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'rouge_chinese.rouge' and the version string assignment.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, external communication, or data processing present.",
  "flows": "Import of functions with obfuscated names; no data flow or execution beyond import and variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated function names, which could be used to conceal malicious code, but no malicious activity is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, performing only imports and variable assignments. The imported symbols have obfuscated names, which raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. No data flows, external communications, or malicious behaviors are present. The obfuscation warrants caution but is not definitive of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with obfuscated identifiers that could be used to hide internal logic but currently show no signs of malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.",
