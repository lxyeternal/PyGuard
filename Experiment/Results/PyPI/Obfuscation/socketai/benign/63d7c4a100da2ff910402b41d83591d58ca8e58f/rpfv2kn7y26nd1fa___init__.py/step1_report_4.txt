  "purpose": "Import specific functions from a module within the rouge_chinese package and define a version string and exported symbols.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'rouge_chinese.rouge' and the string assignment to TNMRdbbyQgHKPIBNRZBTlBSPJiCEevSn.",
  "sinks": "Assignment of a version string; no other sinks present.",
  "flows": "Import statement loads potentially obfuscated or non-standard functions; the version string assignment is static.",
  "anomalies": "Imported function names appear obfuscated and nonsensical, which could indicate malicious intent or obfuscation. No usage or execution of imported functions is shown, making it difficult to determine their behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two functions with seemingly random or obfuscated names from a submodule, which could be a sign of attempting to hide malicious code. The version string is straightforward. There are no visible function calls, data processing, or network operations. The __all__ variable indicates exported symbols. The presence of obfuscated function names without context raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. Overall, the code is minimal, with potential obfuscation but no direct malicious activity observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to import obfuscated functions which could be used for malicious purposes, but as it stands, it only shows import statements and a version string. No malicious behavior or data leaks are evident from this snippet alone. Caution should be maintained due to obfuscated names, but no definitive malicious activity is identified.",
