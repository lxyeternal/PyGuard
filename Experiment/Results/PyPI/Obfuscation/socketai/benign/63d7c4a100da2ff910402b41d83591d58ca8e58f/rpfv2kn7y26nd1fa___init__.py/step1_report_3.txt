{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific functions from the 'rouge_chinese.rouge' module and defines a version string and an export list.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'rouge_chinese.rouge' module",
  "sinks": "No sinks detected; no untrusted data handling or external communication",
  "flows": "Imported functions are assigned but not used or executed in the provided snippet",
  "anomalies": "Unusual function names like 'zLVEopzUYrHkHBoxkbZbTKTFUPirPRUJ' and 'cniaRZkZBAmOArPCjZJYaELfLSCYjxfy' suggest obfuscation or autogenerated code; no meaningful variable or function names",
  "analysis": "The code only imports two functions with obfuscated names from an external module, assigns a version string, and defines an export list. There is no execution of functions, no data handling, and no external network or system interactions. The presence of obfuscated identifiers raises suspicion about intent, but without further code, it appears to be a benign import statement possibly used in a larger context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal and does not contain malicious behavior in isolation. The obfuscated function names suggest possible obfuscation or autogenerated code, but no malicious activity or security issues are evident from this fragment alone.",
