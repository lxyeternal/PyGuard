{
  "purpose": "Import specific functions from the 'rouge_chinese.rouge' package and define a version string and exported modules.",
  "sources": "The import statement from 'rouge_chinese.rouge', and the assignment to the version string and __all__ list.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no untrusted data handling or external outputs beyond imports and variable definitions.",
  "flows": "Import statements load functions; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks. Version string and __all__ are static assignments.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names like 'zLVEopzUYrHkHBoxkbZbTKTFUPirPRUJ' and 'cniaRZkZBAmOArPCjZJYaELfLSCYjxfy' suggest obfuscation or placeholder names. No clear malicious intent evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions with obscure, non-descriptive names, which could indicate obfuscation or malicious intent. However, these are imported from an external package, and the current code only defines a version string and exports list. There are no signs of malicious code, data leakage, or insecure operations. The code is minimal and doesn't perform any suspicious activities by itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign, mainly performing standard import and export definitions. The unusual variable names might be obfuscation but do not inherently indicate malicious behavior. No evidence of malware or security risks in this snippet.",
