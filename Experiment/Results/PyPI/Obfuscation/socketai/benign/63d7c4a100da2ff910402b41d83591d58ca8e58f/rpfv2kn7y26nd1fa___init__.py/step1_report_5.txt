{
  "purpose": "Import specific functions from the 'rouge_chinese.rouge' package and define package metadata and exported symbols.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'rouge_chinese.rouge' module, assigning a version string.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or external communication.",
  "flows": "Imported functions are not used within this code fragment; the version string is set but not used further.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual import names that appear obfuscated; the imported functions have nonsensical names, which may suggest obfuscation or malicious intent. The code lacks comments or documentation explaining these symbols.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two functions with obfuscated names from a module. It sets a version string and defines __all__ for exports. The imported symbols are likely legitimate functions, but their nonsensical names are suspicious. No data input, network activity, or sensitive operations are present. The code is minimal and does not perform any apparent malicious actions. The obfuscated import names could be benign or indicative of obfuscation to hide malicious intent, but with no further context, it’s inconclusive.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to perform standard import and metadata assignment, but the nonsensical function names raise suspicion of obfuscation. There is no direct evidence of malicious activity, yet the obfuscated naming warrants caution. Overall, the code itself does not show malicious behavior but should be reviewed in the context of the larger project.",
