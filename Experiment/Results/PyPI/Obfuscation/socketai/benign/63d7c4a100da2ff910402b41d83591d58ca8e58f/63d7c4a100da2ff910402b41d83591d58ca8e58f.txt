      "conclusion": "While the code exhibits heavy obfuscation and irregular setup parameters, there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior such as code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration. The obfuscation and unusual keys should prompt further review, but based solely on this snippet, the package appears benign. The malware score should be low, but the obfuscation and irregularities justify a moderate security risk score. Further analysis of the actual package contents and runtime behavior is recommended before deployment."

      "conclusion": "The scores for reports 1 and 2 are justified and consistent with their analyses, indicating moderate to high suspicion of malicious activity primarily due to obfuscation and suspicious behaviors. Reports 3-5 correctly reflect absence of code. Overall, the dependency exhibits signs of obfuscation and potential malicious intent, warranting further investigation. The estimated overall malware score is approximately 0.5, obfuscation at 0.7, and security risk at 0.65."

      "conclusion": "The code functions as a legitimate Rouge evaluation tool but is heavily obfuscated, which could be benign or malicious concealment. No active malicious activity is evident from static analysis. The malware score is set to 0.2 reflecting suspicion due to obfuscation, but no concrete malicious behavior is detected. The overall security risk is moderate (0.3), primarily due to obfuscation and syntax irregularities. Further dynamic analysis and source verification are recommended before deployment or trust in unverified environments."
