  "conclusion": "While the code exhibits heavy obfuscation and irregular setup parameters, there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior such as code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration. The obfuscation and unusual keys should prompt further review, but based solely on this snippet, the package appears benign. The malware score should be low, but the obfuscation and irregularities justify a moderate security risk score. Further analysis of the actual package contents and runtime behavior is recommended before deployment."
