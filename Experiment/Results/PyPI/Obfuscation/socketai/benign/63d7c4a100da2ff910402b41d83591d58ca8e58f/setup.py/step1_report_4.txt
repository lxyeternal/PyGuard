{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package, reading version info and README content for package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from '__init__.py' and README.md file.",
  "sinks": "No direct sink for untrusted data; setup configuration is static.",
  "flows": "Reads version and README content, then supplies package metadata to 'setup()'.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function and variable names; unusual variable naming; uses non-standard key names in setup() (e.g., 'WCvnMeMvDkyVxLyAFvJdbBAeLcnEVQVF', 'oebnmzFYmvtOLihhVJNEBoDYMAGdAbCd') which could hide malicious intent; the function for version extraction dynamically reads version info from a file, which could be manipulated; no explicit malicious code or network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup tasks: reading version info from a file, reading README content, and passing metadata to setuptools.setup(). The obfuscated naming and unconventional setup keys are suspicious and could be attempts to hide malicious behavior or make reverse engineering difficult. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious actions are directly evident. The functions are only reading files and passing data into setup(), which is typical in package configuration but combined with obfuscation raises suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard package setup with obfuscated variable names, possibly to hide malicious intent. No explicit malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors, is detected within this code snippet. However, the obfuscation warrants caution and further review of associated files.",
