{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this code is unclear due to lack of comments and context; it appears to import modules and define functions but does not execute any obvious malicious actions.",
  "sources": "The code reads data primarily from imported modules and potentially from environment variables if used within the code (not explicitly shown). No explicit input sources like user input or network requests are visible.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include network connections or data handling functions if present later in the code; however, none are explicitly visible in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "No clear source-to-sink data flows are identified due to the limited code provided; it mainly consists of imports and function definitions without execution or data processing shown.",
  "anomalies": "The code lacks comments, contains minimal functional code, and no obvious anomalies or suspicious patterns are visible. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The provided code snippet mainly includes import statements and function definitions without execution. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks. The absence of data handling, network activity, or other typical malicious indicators suggests this code is benign based on the visible content. Due to limited context, some assumptions about its overall behavior are made, but nothing suspicious is detected.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the analysis, the code appears benign with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It mainly sets up imports and functions without performing harmful actions. The overall security risk score is low, and confidence in this assessment is high.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
