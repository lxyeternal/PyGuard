  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on suspicious patterns, obfuscation, and malicious actions.",
  "sources": "Imports, environment variables, command-line arguments, dynamic code execution functions (exec/eval), hardcoded strings.",
  "sinks": "Potential network communication, file operations, dynamic code execution points, data exfiltration channels.",
  "flows": "Input sources (sys.argv, os.environ) to dynamic execution points (exec/eval), possibly leading to malicious actions or obfuscation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec/eval with untrusted input, dynamic code patterns, moderate obfuscation in some snippets, suspicious data handling.",
  "analysis": "Most code snippets are benign, involving imports and simple data reads, with low malware and obfuscation scores. Report 2 highlights dynamic code execution with untrusted input, justifying higher scores. The overall pattern suggests low risk but with isolated suspicious patterns. Scores are consistent with behaviors: most benign, one suspicious pattern. Confidence levels are high where code is straightforward, slightly lower where dynamic execution is involved. No false positives identified; scores reflect observed patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency code is predominantly benign, with a single pattern (Report 2) indicating potential malicious or obfuscated behavior. The scores are justified and consistent. Slightly lowering overall malware and obfuscation scores from initial estimates (to around 0.2-0.3) is appropriate, maintaining a moderate overall security risk (~0.3). Further static/dynamic analysis recommended for suspicious patterns.",
