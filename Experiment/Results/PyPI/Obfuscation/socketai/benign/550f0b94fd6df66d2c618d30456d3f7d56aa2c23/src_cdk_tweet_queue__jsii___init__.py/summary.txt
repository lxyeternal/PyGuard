  "conclusion": "The dependency code is predominantly benign, with a single pattern (Report 2) indicating potential malicious or obfuscated behavior. The scores are justified and consistent. Slightly lowering overall malware and obfuscation scores from initial estimates (to around 0.2-0.3) is appropriate, maintaining a moderate overall security risk (~0.3). Further static/dynamic analysis recommended for suspicious patterns."
