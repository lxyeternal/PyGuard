  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script intended for general functionality, possibly involving data processing or network communication.",
  "sources": "Input functions, environment variables, imported modules that handle external data or user input.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, file system writes, subprocess calls, or environment variable access that could lead to data exfiltration or system modification.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs or environment variables) to sinks (network, file, or system commands), potentially via intermediate processing steps.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, suspicious network domains, or obfuscated code. No unusual or malicious function calls detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal or absent in the provided snippet; it does not contain typical malicious patterns such as credential theft, data exfiltration, or backdoors. No obfuscated parts or suspicious imports are observed. The structure is straightforward, and the logic appears benign based on the available content.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not exhibit signs of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. It appears to be a benign, standard script with no malicious intent detected.",
