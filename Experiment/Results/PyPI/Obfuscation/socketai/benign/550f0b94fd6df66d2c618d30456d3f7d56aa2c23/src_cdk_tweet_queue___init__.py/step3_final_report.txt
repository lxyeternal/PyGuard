{
  "purpose": "A Python module implementing an AWS CDK construct for polling Twitter's API, enqueuing tweets into SQS, and managing credentials via Secrets Manager, to facilitate Twitter data ingestion into AWS infrastructure.",
  "sources": "SecretsManager secret containing API credentials, Twitter API responses, environment variables for configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "SQS queue where tweets are enqueued, DynamoDB checkpoint table for last tweet ID, potential API responses processed by Lambda functions.",
  "flows": "Secrets from Secrets Manager used in API requests; Twitter API responses flow into SQS; checkpoint IDs stored in DynamoDB; Lambda functions orchestrate polling and data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected; code follows standard AWS and Twitter API practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard AWS CDK construct for Twitter data collection, securely handling secrets via Secrets Manager, with parameters for query and polling interval. No malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The data flow involves secure secret retrieval, API polling, message queuing, and checkpointing, all following best practices. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk~0.2) are consistent with the code's description and security posture.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured AWS infrastructure component for Twitter data ingestion, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk is low, and the code adheres to best practices for secret management and API interaction.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
