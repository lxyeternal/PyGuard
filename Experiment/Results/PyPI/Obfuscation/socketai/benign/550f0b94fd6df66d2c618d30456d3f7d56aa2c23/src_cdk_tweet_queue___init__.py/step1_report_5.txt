{
  "purpose": "This code provides a library for integrating Twitter data streams into AWS infrastructure via CDK constructs, specifically creating a Twitter poller that enqueues tweets into an SQS queue.",
  "sources": "Configuration parameters such as 'secretArn', 'query', 'intervalMin', and AWS resource ARNs; AWS Secrets Manager for API credentials.",
  "sinks": "SQS queue receiving tweets; AWS Secrets Manager storing Twitter API keys.",
  "flows": "API keys are retrieved from Secrets Manager, used by the poller Lambda to query Twitter API, and tweets are enqueued into SQS; last tweet ID is stored in DynamoDB (implied).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors observed. No obfuscation detected. No network connections beyond AWS services or external APIs are explicitly coded here.",
  "analysis": "The code is a descriptive documentation and configuration guide for deploying a Twitter poller using AWS CDK. It explains how to set up secrets, configure polling, and process data with no embedded executable code or malicious patterns. No functions, data flows, or code logic are present in the provided snippet that could be malicious. The only external interactions are with Twitter API via Secrets Manager credentials and AWS resources. No signs of code injection, backdoors, or malicious activities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a configuration and documentation snippet for setting up a Twitter polling system in AWS. It does not contain executable logic, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors. It appears safe and aligned with intended use. No malicious intent or security risks are identified based on this code.",
