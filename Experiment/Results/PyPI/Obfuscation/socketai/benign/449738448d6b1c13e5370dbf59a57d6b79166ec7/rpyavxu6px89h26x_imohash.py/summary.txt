  "conclusion": "The code is a benign file fingerprinting utility that obfuscates variable names but performs standard hashing and encoding operations. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The obfuscation alone does not justify high malware scores. Overall, the script poses low security risk and is suitable for use in secure environments, provided obfuscation is acceptable."
