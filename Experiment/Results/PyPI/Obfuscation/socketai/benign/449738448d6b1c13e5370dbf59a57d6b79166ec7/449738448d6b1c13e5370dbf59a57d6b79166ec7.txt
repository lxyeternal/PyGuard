      "conclusion": "The snippet is a minimal, syntactically correct import statement with obfuscated identifiers and a non-standard module name. While obfuscation raises suspicion, there is no direct evidence of malicious activity. The current scores and assessments are appropriate; further analysis of the `imohash` module is recommended to determine if it contains malicious code or benign obfuscation."

      "obfuscated": 0.7,
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a benign file fingerprinting utility that obfuscates variable names but performs standard hashing and encoding operations. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The obfuscation alone does not justify high malware scores. Overall, the script poses low security risk and is suitable for use in secure environments, provided obfuscation is acceptable."

      "obfuscated": 0.6,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is a benign testing utility that generates and verifies hash data with obfuscation and insecure practices. No active malicious behavior is detected. The main concerns are obfuscation and insecure hash functions, which warrant cautious review before deployment in security-sensitive environments."
