  "purpose": "Minimal import of obfuscated identifiers from a local module `.imohash`, likely for internal use or concealment.",
  "sources": "Import statement sourcing from `.imohash` module, specifically the identifiers `yivzDcNYJHKGrzahOyfAtdAVdOgdaxir` and `aGlgctDlHCXlgnaOKqlNvVhQGangpAsL`.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flow, external interactions, or outputs observed in this snippet.",
  "flows": "N/A — only import statement; no data flow or execution flow evident.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated, nonsensical identifiers and a non-standard module name `.imohash` suggest obfuscation, which could be benign or malicious. No active malicious code or behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement importing two obfuscated identifiers from a local module. The identifiers' nonsensical names and the module name `.imohash` raise suspicion of obfuscation, which is a common red flag but not conclusive of malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware around 0.1-0.2, obfuscation around 0.7-0.8, security risk around 0.2-0.3) are consistent with the minimal evidence of malicious activity but acknowledge the obfuscation concern. No evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code execution is present. The overall risk remains low to moderate, primarily due to obfuscation, warranting further review of the `imohash` module but not immediate danger.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet is a minimal, syntactically correct import statement with obfuscated identifiers and a non-standard module name. While obfuscation raises suspicion, there is no direct evidence of malicious activity. The current scores and assessments are appropriate; further analysis of the `imohash` module is recommended to determine if it contains malicious code or benign obfuscation.",
