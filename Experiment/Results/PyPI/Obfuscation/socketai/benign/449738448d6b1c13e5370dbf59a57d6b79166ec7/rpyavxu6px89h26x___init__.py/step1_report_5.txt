{
  "purpose": "Import specific functions or variables from the local 'imohash' module.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads data from the local module 'imohash'.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; no external data output or network activity present.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident in this single import statement; it simply loads symbols into the namespace.",
  "anomalies": "Imported identifiers have obfuscated-looking names, which could indicate attempts to hide malicious intent or obscure functionality.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard import from a local module. The imported names are unusual and appear intentionally obfuscated, which is suspicious but not definitive evidence of malicious intent. There are no signs of network activity, data leakage, or code execution. Without additional context or code, the risk level remains uncertain. The obfuscated variable names could be benign or malicious, but this alone warrants scrutiny.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward import statement with obfuscated identifiers. No explicit malicious behavior is apparent from this fragment alone, but the unusual naming warrants further review of the 'imohash' module for hidden or malicious code.",
