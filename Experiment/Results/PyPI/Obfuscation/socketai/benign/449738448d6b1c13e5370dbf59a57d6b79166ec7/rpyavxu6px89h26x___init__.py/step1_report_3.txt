  "purpose": "Import specific functions or variables from a local module named 'imohash'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the local module '.imohash' and accesses its exports 'yivzDcNYJHKGrzahOyfAtdAVdOgdaxir' and 'aGlgctDlHCXlgnaOKqlNvVhQGangpAsL'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are explicitly present; the code merely imports functions or variables.",
  "flows": "Import statement reads data from a local module; no further data flow or untrusted input handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names 'yivzDcNYJHKGrzahOyfAtdAVdOgdaxir' and 'aGlgctDlHCXlgnaOKqlNvVhQGangpAsL' appear obfuscated or nonsensical, which may suggest obfuscation or concealment. The code lacks context for what these symbols are or do.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single import statement from a relative module '.imohash'. The imported identifiers are lengthy and nonsensical, indicating potential obfuscation. No additional code, data handling, or logic is present to evaluate further. This could be normal for a module that exports obfuscated functions or variables, but the lack of context makes it suspicious. No signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data leaks, or code execution are evident in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet appears to import potentially obfuscated variables or functions from a local module. While obfuscated names can be benign, they can also indicate an attempt to conceal malicious intent. Without additional code context, there is no definitive evidence of malicious behavior, but the obfuscation warrants caution.",
