  "purpose": "A minimal Django management script that sets the environment variable for Django settings and executes commands based on user input.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (command-line arguments used to determine which management command to run)",
  "sinks": "execute_from_command_line(sys.argv) (executes the command specified by user input)",
  "flows": "sys.argv → execute_from_command_line (passing user input directly to command execution)",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward code with standard pattern; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Django management script that sets an environment variable and executes commands based on command-line arguments. It does not contain malicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets. The primary security concern is that passing untrusted input directly to command execution can be risky if inputs are malicious or unvalidated. The code itself is safe, but in deployment, input validation or restrictions should be considered to mitigate potential misuse. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate and justified by the code's simplicity and standard pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe Django management script with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The main security consideration is the inherent risk of executing commands based on user input, which is typical for such scripts but should be managed carefully in deployment. The scoring reflects this understanding, with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation.",
