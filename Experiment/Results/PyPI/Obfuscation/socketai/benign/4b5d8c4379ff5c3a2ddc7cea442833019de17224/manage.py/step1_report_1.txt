  "purpose": "This script initializes a Django environment and executes a command-line management utility.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv) and environment variables (os.environ)",
  "sinks": "execute_from_command_line uses sys.argv, which could be influenced by user input",
  "flows": "User input (sys.argv) flows into execute_from_command_line after environment setup",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated code present; environment variable setup is standard for Django apps",
  "analysis": "The script sets a default environment variable for Django settings, then invokes Django's command-line interface with user-provided arguments. There are no hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or unusual behaviors. The code is typical for Django project management scripts and does not contain signs of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Django management script with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It solely manages Django commands based on user input.",
