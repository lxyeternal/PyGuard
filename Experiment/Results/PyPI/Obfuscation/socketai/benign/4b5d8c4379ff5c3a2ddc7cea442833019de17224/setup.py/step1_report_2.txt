  "purpose": "Configure package setup using setuptools with pbr as a build dependency",
  "sources": "setuptools.setup() call, setup_requires argument, pbr argument",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external data sources are used that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only initializes package configuration without data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and invokes the setup() function with parameters to require pbr version >= 2.0.0 and enables pbr. This is standard for Python package configuration. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network calls, code execution, or data leakage. The code is minimal and straightforward, serving only package setup purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package using setuptools and pbr, with no malicious intent or security concerns identified.",
