  "purpose": "Configure package setup using setuptools with pbr integration.",
  "sources": "setuptools.setup() call, reading package configuration and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or malicious actions; setup process does not handle external input.",
  "flows": "Setup configuration is static; no dynamic data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code appears to be a standard setup script with minimal configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and calls the setup function, passing setup_requires with a dependency on pbr>=2.0.0 and enabling pbr. This is a typical setup configuration for Python packages that use PBR for versioning and metadata. There are no signs of code injection, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic. The code is minimal and straightforward, serving the purpose of package setup without performing any runtime operations beyond configuration. Since it does not handle user input, network connections, or data processing, the risk of malicious activity is extremely low.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply configures package metadata and dependencies. The malware score is negligible, and the security risk is minimal.",
