  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present in this code snippet",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis is possible from a single import statement; no source-to-sink flows identified",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; the only activity is an import statement. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code only performs a relative import of the 'designate' module within the package. There are no embedded functions, data handling, or suspicious operations. Given the minimal content, no malicious or anomalous behavior is detectable.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module import statement with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be standard practice within a package.",
