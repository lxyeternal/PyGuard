  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Dynamic imports, environment variables, network/system calls, input/output functions.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file system modifications, environment variable access, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as dynamic imports or environment variables leading to potential data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic imports, obfuscation patterns, complex or unusual code structures, lack of operational content in some snippets.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets generally show benign behavior with no suspicious patterns. Report 3 exhibits obfuscation and dynamic imports, raising suspicion but lacking confirmed malicious payloads. Scores are consistent with the evidence: low malware (0.2), high obfuscation (0.7), and moderate security risk (0.4). The other reports are straightforward, with scores reflecting their benign nature. Slightly increasing malware suspicion in Report 3 from 0.2 to 0.3 better captures the suspicious features. Overall, the code appears low risk with some obfuscation concerns, but no confirmed malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency code is mostly benign, with Report 3 showing suspicious obfuscation and dynamic import patterns that warrant a slightly higher malware score. The overall security risk remains moderate due to obfuscation but lacks confirmed malicious payloads.",
