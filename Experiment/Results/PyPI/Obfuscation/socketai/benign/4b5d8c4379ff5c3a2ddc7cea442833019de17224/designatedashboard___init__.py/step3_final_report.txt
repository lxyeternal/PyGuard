  "purpose": "Retrieve the version string of the 'designate-dashboard' package using the pbr library.",
  "sources": "Import of 'pbr.version' and access to 'pbr.CQnfyqzaGtVZbfAiLBTPwNwMyyBbGrSF.VersionInfo' attribute.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or network activity; purely local attribute access.",
  "flows": "Import -> Attribute access -> version_string() call -> variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated attribute name 'CQnfyqzaGtVZbfAiLBTPwNwMyyBbGrSF' and variable name 'bHGsUkjIjRAchmlnnubYlZWIWECvqWnN'.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard version retrieval for 'designate-dashboard' via the pbr library. The attribute and variable names are nonsensical or obfuscated, which could be an attempt to hide intent but does not indicate malicious behavior. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious logic is present. The obfuscation is consistent across reports and justified by the unusual naming. The code's core function is benign, and the obfuscation alone does not imply malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign version retrieval with obfuscated variable and attribute names. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security risk. The obfuscation warrants caution but is not sufficient to classify the code as malicious. The scores are appropriate: malware score 0, obfuscation score around 0.7, low security risk (~0.2).",
