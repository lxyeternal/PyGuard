{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define several string variables and a list, possibly for configuration or referencing specific project or dashboard components.",
  "sources": "Variable assignments and list definitions; no external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as database operations, network communication, or file writes are present.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; variables are assigned static values with no processing or data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "The variable names are obfuscated and do not clearly convey their purpose. The strings suggest references to dashboards, panels, or project components, but there are no signs of malicious code, such as dynamic execution, data exfiltration, or code injection. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, consisting of static variable assignments with obfuscated variable names. It lacks input handling, dynamic code execution, or network activity. The naming scheme is obscure but does not directly indicate malicious intent. Without additional context, it appears to be simple configuration or reference data, with no malicious behavior or security risks evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is likely harmless, serving as configuration or references within a larger project. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues.",
