{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define several variables, mostly strings and lists, likely intended for configuration or referencing dashboard components related to 'dnszones' and 'project'.",
  "sources": "Variable assignments at the beginning, assigning string literals and list literals to variables.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks like system commands, network calls, or data outputs are present; variables are assigned but not used further in this fragment.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks occurs within this fragment; it only defines variables without further processing.",
  "anomalies": "Variables are named with seemingly random strings, and the use of obfuscated variable names may suggest code obfuscation. The variable names do not correspond to conventional coding standards and seem intentionally obscure. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code like network calls, data exfiltration, or system modifications are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is composed of variable assignments with obscure variable names and string/lists values, likely intended for configuration purposes. The absence of operations, function calls, or external interactions indicates this is a static configuration snippet. The naming pattern and style could be an attempt at obfuscation, but no malicious activity or malicious code patterns are detected. The code does not perform any harmful actions or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign configuration or reference setup with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks in this fragment.",
