{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define several string variables and list variables, likely related to dashboard configuration or data identifiers.",
  "sources": "Variables assigned with string literals and list literals. No external input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "No evident sink functions or operations that handle untrusted data or perform insecure actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; variables seem static and predefined.",
  "anomalies": "Use of seemingly random, obfuscated variable names; no clear purpose; no external inputs or dynamic code execution; code appears as static assignments.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable assignments with hardcoded string values and lists. Variable names are nonsensical, which could suggest obfuscation, but no malicious activity or security risk behaviors are evident. No input handling, no network operations, no cryptographic functions, and no suspicious behavior are present. The static nature of the code indicates it is likely configuration or metadata rather than executable malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not show signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be static configuration data with obfuscated variable names but no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
