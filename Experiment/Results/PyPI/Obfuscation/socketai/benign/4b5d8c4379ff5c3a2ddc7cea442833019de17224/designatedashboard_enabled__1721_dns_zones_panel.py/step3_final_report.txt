  "purpose": "Static configuration data related to dashboards and DNS zones, with obfuscated variable names, no dynamic behavior or external inputs.",
  "sources": "Variable assignments and list definitions within the code",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data or external communication; static data only",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; all data is static and predefined",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; no actual malicious activity or dynamic code execution observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string and list assignments with obfuscated variable names. There are no external inputs, network calls, or dynamic behaviors. The obfuscation appears to be superficial, serving as variable naming rather than malicious concealment. No signs of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors, are present. The malware score is appropriately zero, and the low security risk scores reflect the benign, configuration-like nature of the code. The obfuscation score is moderate, acknowledging the non-descriptive variable names, but this does not imply malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign static configuration data with obfuscated variable names. No malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities are detected. The scores assigned in the reports are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
