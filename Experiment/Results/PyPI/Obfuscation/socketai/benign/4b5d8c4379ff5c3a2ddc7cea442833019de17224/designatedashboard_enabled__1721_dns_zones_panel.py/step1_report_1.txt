{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define string variables and lists related to dashboard configuration or naming conventions, potentially for a web or monitoring dashboard system.",
  "sources": "String assignments and list definitions at the beginning, which do not read external input but set internal data structures.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network calls, file writes, or eval statements are present.",
  "flows": "Data flow involves variable assignments without any external or untrusted data inputs or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "The variable names are obfuscated and do not follow standard naming conventions, which could be suspicious. The string values seem to be related to dashboards and panels, but there's no clear malicious pattern. The code lacks any dynamic execution, external calls, or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly consists of variable assignments with obfuscated variable names and static string values related to dashboard components. There are no inputs, network activities, or suspicious operations. The variable names and strings could be intentionally obfuscated, but without evidence of malicious behavior, it appears benign. No suspicious functions, code injection points, or data leaks are evident. The code seems to set up or configure dashboard references or identifiers.",
  "conclusion": "The code is likely part of a dashboard configuration or setup script, with obfuscated variable names but no malicious intent or security risks identified. It does not perform any operations that could compromise security or indicate malware.",
