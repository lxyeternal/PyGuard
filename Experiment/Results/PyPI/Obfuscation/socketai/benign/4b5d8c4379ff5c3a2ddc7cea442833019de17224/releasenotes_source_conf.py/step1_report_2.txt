{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be configuration or metadata related to documentation for a project called 'Designate dashboard'. It defines variables, lists, dictionaries, and tuples containing strings and other data likely used for documentation building or project setup.",
  "sources": "Variable assignments, list initializations, and dictionary definitions, including string literals and list literals.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks that process untrusted input or data flows leading to security-critical operations such as database queries, network communication, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks is apparent. The code mostly initializes static data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The variables contain static strings, and no dynamic execution or external input handling is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of variable and list definitions with static string data. There is no evidence of input reading, data processing, or external data manipulation. No malicious patterns or obfuscated logic are present. The structure suggests configuration or documentation metadata setup, which is common and benign. The absence of external inputs, network calls, or system modifications indicates low risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration/data setup for project documentation purposes. No malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious activity are detected. The code appears safe and standard for its apparent purpose.",
