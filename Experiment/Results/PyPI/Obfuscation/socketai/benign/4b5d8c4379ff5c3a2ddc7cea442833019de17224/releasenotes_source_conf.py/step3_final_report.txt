  "purpose": "Static configuration and metadata for documentation and project setup, with obfuscated variable names.",
  "sources": "Variable assignments, list and dictionary initializations, static string literals.",
  "sinks": "No external inputs, no data flows to sensitive operations, no network or file I/O.",
  "flows": "None; data is static and self-contained.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, but no malicious or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static data definitions with obfuscated variable names, likely auto-generated or for internal use. No functions, input handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present. No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or malicious payloads are detected. The obfuscation appears superficial and does not indicate malicious intent. The code's purpose seems to be configuration or documentation metadata, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign configuration data with obfuscated variable names. There is no malicious intent, payload, or suspicious behavior. The security risk is negligible, and malware likelihood is zero.",
