  "purpose": "Static configuration for documentation generation, setting variables related to Sphinx and OpenStack documentation.",
  "sources": "Variable assignments, sys.path modification, static string and boolean values.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external data processing or network activity.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, which are unusual but not malicious in this context.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static configuration script with obfuscated variable names. It performs no dynamic operations, external data handling, or network activity. The obfuscation raises suspicion but is used solely for static configuration purposes. No malicious code, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities are present. The malware score is appropriately zero, and the obfuscation score is high but justified. The overall security risk is minimal.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign configuration data for documentation purposes. Despite obfuscated variable names, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security threats. The scores should be malware=0, obfuscated≈0.7, risk≈0.1, aligning with the static, non-malicious nature of the code.",
