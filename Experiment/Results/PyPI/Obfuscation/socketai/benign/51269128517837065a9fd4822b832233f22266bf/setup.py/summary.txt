  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static setup script with an unusual package name and external URL dependency. No malicious activity or obfuscation is present within this snippet. The main concern is verifying the trustworthiness of the external archive before installation. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0.2, securityRisk=0.2-0.3) are appropriate and consistent across reports. Overall, the package appears safe, with the primary caution being external source verification."
