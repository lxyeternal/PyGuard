  "purpose": "Static package setup metadata defining name, version, download URL, dependencies, and classifiers.",
  "sources": "No dynamic input; static parameters in setup() call.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or execution.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual, obfuscated-looking package name; external download URL pointing to GitHub archive.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static setup script with no code execution, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The package name appears random, which is suspicious but not inherently malicious. The external URL could be a supply chain risk if compromised, but the script itself does not perform any network activity or code download at runtime. The dependency 'aiohttp' is legitimate. All reports correctly identify the static nature and the potential concern about the external source. Malware scores are appropriately zero; obfuscation scores are slightly elevated due to the package name; security risk scores reflect reliance on external sources but no active malicious behavior. The scores are consistent with the code's content and context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static setup script with an unusual package name and external URL dependency. No malicious activity or obfuscation is present within this snippet. The main concern is verifying the trustworthiness of the external archive before installation. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0.2, securityRisk=0.2-0.3) are appropriate and consistent across reports. Overall, the package appears safe, with the primary caution being external source verification.",
