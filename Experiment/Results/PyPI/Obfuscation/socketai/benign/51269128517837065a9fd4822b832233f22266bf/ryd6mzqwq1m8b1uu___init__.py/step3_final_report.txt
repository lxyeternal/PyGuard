  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Standard input sources such as environment variables, files, network connections, and dynamic code execution functions like eval/exec.",
  "sinks": "Potential data exfiltration points, network communications, file modifications, or system commands that could lead to data leaks or system compromise.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (e.g., untrusted input, environment variables) through processing functions to sinks (e.g., network transmission, file writes, eval/exec execution).",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, suspicious control flow, or network connections to suspicious domains.",
  "analysis": "The code review indicates that most reports describe benign scripts with standard data processing, no suspicious activity, and no obfuscation. High malware and obfuscation scores are justified only in reports explicitly mentioning obfuscation and unsafe functions (e.g., eval/exec). Missing code in some reports prevents analysis, resulting in low confidence scores. The scores for malware (mostly 0), obfuscation (mostly 0), and security risk (generally low, around 0.2) are consistent with the descriptions. Report 2 shows significant suspicious patterns, justifying high scores (~0.75-0.8). Overall, the assessments are aligned with the evidence, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with low security risks; only report 2 indicates potential malicious behavior due to obfuscation and unsafe functions. The scoring is appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No major revisions are needed.",
