{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform standard data processing tasks, with no obvious malicious intent or harmful operations.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function parameters and possibly environment variables; no external untrusted input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "Data is processed internally; no direct outputs or network transmissions are present that would act as sinks for untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters or environment variables through processing functions, with no evidence of untrusted data being sent or stored insecurely.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscation are present. The code structure is straightforward. No unusual language features or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python script with functions performing typical data handling, with no signs of malicious behavior. No code injection, data leakage, or unsafe operations are observed. Usage of third-party libraries is benign. The code does not connect to external domains, send data over the network, or access sensitive system resources in a suspicious manner.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be legitimate application logic without harmful intent.",
