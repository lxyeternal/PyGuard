  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated due to lack of context and the code content is missing.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from environment variables, user input, and potentially external files or network sources (if present). Specific sources are unclear without code content.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writing, or executing system commands if such functions are used.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or user inputs towards sinks like network, file system, or system commands, if present.",
  "anomalies": "No specific anomalies or suspicious code constructs observed due to lack of visible code. The absence of code prevents identifying hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "Without the actual code content, a thorough analysis cannot be performed. Normally, the review would identify data sources, sinks, flow paths, and anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious function calls, or unusual code structures. Since the code is missing, no such patterns can be confirmed or denied.",
  "conclusion": "Insufficient code provided for a definitive analysis. No evidence of malicious behavior or security issues can be assessed without code content.",
