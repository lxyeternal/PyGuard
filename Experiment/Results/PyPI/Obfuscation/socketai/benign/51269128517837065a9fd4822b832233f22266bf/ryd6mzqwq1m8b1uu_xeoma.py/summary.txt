  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate but obfuscated surveillance client, with techniques that could be used to hide malicious activity. However, based solely on static analysis, there is no evidence of malware or malicious behavior. The scores assigned are consistent with the analysis: low malware risk (~0.2), high obfuscation (~0.75), and moderate security risk (~0.4). Continuous monitoring is recommended if deployed in sensitive environments."
