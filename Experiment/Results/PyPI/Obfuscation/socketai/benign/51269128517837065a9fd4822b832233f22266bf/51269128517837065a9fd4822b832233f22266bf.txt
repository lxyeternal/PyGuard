      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static setup script with an unusual package name and external URL dependency. No malicious activity or obfuscation is present within this snippet. The main concern is verifying the trustworthiness of the external archive before installation. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0.2, securityRisk=0.2-0.3) are appropriate and consistent across reports. Overall, the package appears safe, with the primary caution being external source verification."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate but obfuscated surveillance client, with techniques that could be used to hide malicious activity. However, based solely on static analysis, there is no evidence of malware or malicious behavior. The scores assigned are consistent with the analysis: low malware risk (~0.2), high obfuscation (~0.75), and moderate security risk (~0.4). Continuous monitoring is recommended if deployed in sensitive environments."
