  "conclusion": "The dependency exhibits some suspicious characteristics, primarily obfuscation and dynamic code usage, but no confirmed malicious activity. The scores are adjusted to reflect this, with malware at 0.3, obfuscated at 0.5, and overall security risk at 0.4, indicating moderate concern. The code should be reviewed further if dynamic features are used in suspicious contexts."
