  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code snippets, dynamic features (eval, exec), hardcoded secrets, network connections, file operations.",
  "sinks": "Network transmissions, file modifications, environment variable access, dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as eval/exec or network data flow into potential malicious actions or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, obscure variable names, or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code shows moderate suspicion due to obfuscation and dynamic features, but no concrete malicious payloads are identified. The scores reflect cautious suspicion, with malware at 0.3 and obfuscation at 0.5, aligning with the potential for malicious intent but lacking definitive evidence.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency exhibits some suspicious characteristics, primarily obfuscation and dynamic code usage, but no confirmed malicious activity. The scores are adjusted to reflect this, with malware at 0.3, obfuscated at 0.5, and overall security risk at 0.4, indicating moderate concern. The code should be reviewed further if dynamic features are used in suspicious contexts.",
