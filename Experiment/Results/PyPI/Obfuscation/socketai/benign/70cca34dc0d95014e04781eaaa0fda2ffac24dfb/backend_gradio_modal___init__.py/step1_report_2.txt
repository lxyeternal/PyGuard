{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module import statement and an export declaration, likely part of a larger package or module structure.",
  "sources": "The code reads from a relative import '.modal' to import 'xAeMDnjKvwkGIDZrILEqCBTHpVwmJWkH'.",
  "sinks": "The import statement could be a sink if it involves malicious or obfuscated code execution, but on its own, it is a standard import.",
  "flows": "The source is the import statement, but there are no flows to external sinks or data leaks shown in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The imported symbol 'xAeMDnjKvwkGIDZrILEqCBTHpVwmJWkH' appears to be an obfuscated or nonsensical name, which can be suspicious. The module name 'modal' is standard, but the imported name looks intentionally obfuscated.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting of a relative import from a module named 'modal' and an explicit __all__ export. The imported symbol's name is highly unusual and looks like random characters, which could indicate obfuscation or an attempt to hide malicious intent. There are no visible malicious actions like network connections or data manipulation. The code does not perform any operations or contain any logic beyond the import and export statement.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself is very simple and standard in structure, but the obfuscated import name raises suspicion. This could be an attempt to hide malicious code or simply obfuscated variable naming. Based on this fragment alone, there is no explicit malicious behavior, but the obfuscated symbol warrants further review in the context of the entire package.",
