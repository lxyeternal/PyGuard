{
  "purpose": "Define an import from a relative module and specify an export list for the module.",
  "sources": "The code reads from a relative import '.modal' to access 'xAeMDnjKvwkGIDZrILEqCBTHpVwmJWkH'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating potential data leak or malicious data handling are present.",
  "flows": "The code imports a potentially obfuscated or random-named attribute and exposes 'Modal'.",
  "anomalies": "The imported attribute name 'xAeMDnjKvwkGIDZrILEqCBTHpVwmJWkH' appears random or obfuscated, which can be suspicious. The import source is a relative module, but the attribute's name suggests possible obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code only performs a relative import of an attribute with a nonsensical or obfuscated name from a module named '.modal'. It then exposes 'Modal' via __all__. The suspicious aspect is the imported attribute name, which appears intentionally obfuscated or randomly generated. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The code itself is minimal and structurally normal, but the naming pattern raises some concern about obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple module that imports an obfuscated attribute and exposes 'Modal'. The obfuscated attribute name warrants suspicion but does not by itself indicate malicious intent. No malicious activity or malicious payload is evident. Overall, the code is minimal with a slight concern over naming obfuscation, but no clear malicious behavior is detected.",
