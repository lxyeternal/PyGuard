{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to expose the 'Modal' object for import and re-export a potentially obscured module import.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the relative import '.modal' and the attribute 'xAeMDnjKvwkGIDZrILEqCBTHpVwmJWkH'.",
  "sinks": "The 'xAeMDnjKvwkGIDZrILEqCBTHpVwmJWkH' could be a source of dynamic execution if used elsewhere, but in this snippet it is only imported.",
  "flows": "No explicit flows are visible in this code snippet; the import indicates potential flow if the imported attribute is used dynamically elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "The attribute 'xAeMDnjKvwkGIDZrILEqCBTHpVwmJWkH' appears obfuscated, which could be an attempt to hide malicious or sensitive code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports an obfuscated attribute from a relative module, which suggests the code might be hiding functionality. The presence of a random-looking attribute name is suspicious but not inherently malicious. The '__all__' export exposes only 'Modal'. There are no direct signs of malicious behavior in this snippet; however, the obfuscated import raises concern about potential hidden behavior if used improperly elsewhere.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet by itself is not definitively malicious but contains obfuscated naming which warrants further review of the 'modal' module and its contents. No direct malicious activity is observable here.",
