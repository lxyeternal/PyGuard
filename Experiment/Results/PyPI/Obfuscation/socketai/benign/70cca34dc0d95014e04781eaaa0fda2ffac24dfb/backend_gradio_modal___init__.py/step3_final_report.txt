  "purpose": "Minimal import statement from a local module 'modal' importing an obfuscated attribute, exposing 'Modal' in __all__.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .modal of obfuscated name 'xAeMDnjKvwkGIDZrILEqCBTHpVwmJWkH'.",
  "sinks": "None in this snippet; no external data, network, or system interaction.",
  "flows": "Import of obfuscated attribute from local module, exposure via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a nonsensical, obfuscated attribute name; filename '.modal' with dot prefix.",
  "analysis": "The code imports an obfuscated symbol from a local module and exposes 'Modal'. No malicious behavior or vulnerabilities are evident. The obfuscated name suggests concealment but does not confirm malicious intent. The code is syntactically correct and minimal. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware and risk scores should remain low given the lack of active malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign but suspicious due to obfuscation. No evidence of malicious activity is present. Further review of the 'modal' module is recommended to confirm the nature of the imported symbol.",
