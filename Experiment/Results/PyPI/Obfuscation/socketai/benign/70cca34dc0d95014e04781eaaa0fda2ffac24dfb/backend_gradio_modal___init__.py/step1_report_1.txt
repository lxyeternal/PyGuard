  "purpose": "Import a specific class or function from a local module named 'modal' and expose 'Modal' in the module's namespace.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'xAeMDnjKvwkGIDZrILEqCBTHpVwmJWkH' from the local module 'modal'.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or outputs; no network, file, or environment interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Import statement retrieves code or data from the local module; no data flows to external sinks or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "The imported name 'xAeMDnjKvwkGIDZrILEqCBTHpVwmJWkH' appears to be a nonsensical, obfuscated, or randomly generated identifier, which may indicate obfuscation or concealment.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple import of a potentially obfuscated or randomly named element from a local module named 'modal' and exposes a public symbol 'Modal'. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communication, or code execution. The presence of a seemingly random or obfuscated import name raises a slight concern of possible concealment, but on its own, it does not constitute malicious activity. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a minimal import statement with an obfuscated import name. There is no direct indication of malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risks. The unusual import name might be a form of obfuscation but does not, by itself, suggest malicious activity.",
