  "purpose": "Analyze open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks, focusing on code patterns, data flows, and suspicious indicators.",
  "sources": "Input sources include data reads such as environment variables, user inputs, or network calls; sinks include data exfiltration points, system modifications, or network transmissions.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks involve network connections, file writes, or environment modifications that could leak data or execute malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) to sinks (outputs), with suspicious patterns like eval(), hardcoded URLs, or obfuscated code indicating malicious intent.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation, dynamic code execution (eval, exec), hardcoded secrets, unusual string encodings, or suspicious imports.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits typical benign patterns in reports 1-3 and 5, with no suspicious data flows or obfuscation. Report 4 shows significant obfuscation (eval, encoded strings), hardcoded credentials, and dynamic execution, indicating potential malicious intent. The malware score in report 4 should be increased from 0.4 to around 0.6 to better reflect suspicion. Confidence levels align with the evidence; the overall assessment suggests low risk for reports 1-3 and 5, and moderate risk for report 4.",
  "conclusion": "Most code snippets are benign, with report 4 showing notable obfuscation and suspicious patterns. Increasing the malware score for report 4 to approximately 0.6 is justified to account for potential malicious behavior, while other reports remain low risk.",
