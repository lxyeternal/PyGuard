  "purpose": "Defines a custom UI component class for the Gradio framework that conditionally hides itself using JavaScript.",
  "sources": "The class constructor and the conditional call to self.blur() with embedded JavaScript code.",
  "sinks": "The JavaScript string passed to self.blur(), which updates the component's visibility.",
  "flows": "From class initialization to the conditional invocation of self.blur() with JavaScript, leading to UI visibility change.",
  "anomalies": "Use of JavaScript code strings for UI manipulation; class name appears obfuscated; minimal obfuscation in string literals.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a UI component that, upon initialization, checks if Context.root_block exists and then calls self.blur() with a JavaScript snippet to hide the component. The JavaScript is straightforward, returning an object to set visibility to false. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or malicious payloads are present. The obfuscation level is low to moderate, mainly due to the class name and string literals, but nothing indicates malicious intent. The embedded JavaScript is standard for dynamic UI updates. The malware score is 0, consistent with no malicious behavior. The risk score (~0.2) reflects minimal concern due to dynamic JavaScript injection, which is common in UI frameworks but should be monitored in broader contexts. Overall, the code appears benign, serving a UI purpose without malicious activity or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign UI component that uses JavaScript snippets to control visibility. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The obfuscation is minor and typical for UI scripting. The assigned malware score of 0 and low risk score (~0.2) are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.",
