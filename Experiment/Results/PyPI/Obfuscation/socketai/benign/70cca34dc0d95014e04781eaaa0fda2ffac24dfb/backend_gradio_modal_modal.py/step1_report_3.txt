  "purpose": "Define a custom GUI layout component using the Gradio framework with configurable parameters.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to __init__ method, class attributes, and context checks.",
  "sinks": "The call to self.blur() with a JavaScript function string.",
  "flows": "Initialization parameters → class attributes → conditional check → self.blur() call with JavaScript code.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated or unclear JavaScript code in the self.blur() method; use of dynamically generated code string; no visible user input validation or sanitization.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class extending BlockContext, setting up some event handling and configuration options. It conditionally invokes self.blur() with a string containing JavaScript code that returns an object with '__type__' and 'visible' attributes. The code appears to be used to hide or update UI components. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or system modifications are evident. The JavaScript code is dynamically passed as a string, but it merely returns a static object to presumably modify UI visibility. There are no external data flows, network operations, or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign component definition for a GUI layout, with no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The only noteworthy aspect is the use of dynamically injected JavaScript code to perform UI updates, which by itself is not malicious but should be reviewed in context. Overall, it does not pose security risks based on this snippet.",
