  "conclusion": "The code is a benign UI component that uses JavaScript snippets to control visibility. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The obfuscation is minor and typical for UI scripting. The assigned malware score of 0 and low risk score (~0.2) are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary."
