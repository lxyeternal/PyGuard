  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided code snippets and reports.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, network/file operations, environment inputs, utility functions, data processing routines.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file I/O, subprocess calls, environment variables, data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or user inputs flow into network requests, file writes, or subprocess executions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious dynamic code, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns detected; code appears minimal or benign.",
  "analysis": "All reports consistently indicate minimal or no code, with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. Scores for malware and obfuscation are zero, aligning with the absence of suspicious features. Security risk scores are low (0.1–0.3), justified by the minimal content and cautious assessments. Confidence levels are high where code is minimal or absent. No significant anomalies or suspicious patterns are identified. The evaluations are coherent and justified based on the provided descriptions.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets analyzed are benign, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The low security risk scores are appropriate given the minimal and non-suspicious nature of the code. The assessments are consistent and justified; no adjustments are necessary.",
