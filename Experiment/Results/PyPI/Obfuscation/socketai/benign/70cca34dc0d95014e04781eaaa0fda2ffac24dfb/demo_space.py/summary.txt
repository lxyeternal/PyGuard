  "conclusion": "The code is benign, mainly UI configuration with obfuscation and dynamic scripting. No malicious behavior or supply chain security issues are detected. The low malware score (0) and low security risk (0.2) are justified. Obfuscation is moderate, and overall, the code poses minimal security threat."
