{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Gradio interface with themes, CSS, multiple tabs, modals, and dynamic JavaScript for UI enhancement and link creation.",
  "sources": "CSS loaded from local file, user input via Textboxes, button click events, embedded JavaScript manipulating DOM elements.",
  "sinks": "DOM manipulation via JavaScript, dynamic creation of modal components, button-triggered modal display, innerHTML modifications.",
  "flows": "User inputs trigger submit functions; button clicks instantiate modals; JavaScript modifies innerHTML based on predefined patterns.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, embedded JavaScript with regex replacements, dynamic resource loading, multiple modal instances created via loops.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily constructs a UI with obfuscation and dynamic JavaScript. No network activity, file system tampering, or malicious payloads are evident. Obfuscation appears to be for concealment or aesthetic purposes rather than malicious intent. JavaScript manipulations are typical for UI enhancements but could be exploited if inputs were untrusted; however, current code uses static strings. Scores reflect low malicious potential and minimal security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, mainly UI configuration with obfuscation and dynamic scripting. No malicious behavior or supply chain security issues are detected. The low malware score (0) and low security risk (0.2) are justified. Obfuscation is moderate, and overall, the code poses minimal security threat.",
