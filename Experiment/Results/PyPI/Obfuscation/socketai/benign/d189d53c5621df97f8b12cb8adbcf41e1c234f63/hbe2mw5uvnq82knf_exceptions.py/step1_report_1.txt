{
  "purpose": "Define multiple custom exception classes for error handling related to file paths, content types, and unsupported query types.",
  "sources": "Class initializers and string assignments; no external input or data sources present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs are present; code primarily constructs exception messages.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; exception message construction uses internal variables.",
  "anomalies": "Use of heavily obfuscated class and variable names; no clear use of sensitive data or malicious logic; no code injection or external network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from a base exception. Each class constructs messages based on internal attributes, which are set via constructor parameters. There is no code that reads external input dynamically, communicates over the network, or performs any suspicious actions. The naming appears intentionally obfuscated, but the functionality is benign, focused on error handling. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, data theft, or malicious payloads. No security risks identified within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of custom exception definitions with obfuscated names but no malicious or suspicious activity. It appears to serve as part of an error handling framework for a larger application, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
