  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, configuring dependencies, package data, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Static data in variables defining dependencies, package data, and entry points; no external input handling.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data processed or external communication occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; configuration data is static and used during package setup.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, presence of a suspicious dependency 'ttp' (likely a typo or obfuscation), and embedded string 'hbe2mw5uvnq82knf' used multiple times as package data or identifiers.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py with obfuscated variable names and a dependency 'ttp' that does not match any known package, suggesting a typo or obfuscation. The variable 'hbe2mw5uvnq82knf' appears as a directory and in package data, possibly as an obfuscation marker or secret. No dynamic code, network activity, or malicious code is present. The obfuscation is superficial, and the dependency 'ttp' warrants verification. Overall, the script is benign but contains anomalies that merit further review.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script appears to be a benign package configuration with superficial obfuscation and a suspicious dependency 'ttp'. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain attack. The anomalies should be verified—particularly the dependency and embedded string—but they do not currently indicate malicious intent.",
