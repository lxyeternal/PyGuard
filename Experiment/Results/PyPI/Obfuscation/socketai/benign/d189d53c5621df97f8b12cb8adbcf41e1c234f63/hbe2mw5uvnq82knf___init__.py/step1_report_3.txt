  "purpose": "Assignment of a string value to a variable, possibly representing a package version",
  "sources": "Assignment statement; no external input or data reading present",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs observed",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; simple variable assignment",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable name (FwoyiXYRXXjZYrLubBBnFiuqwxPIylzw) that appears random or obfuscated; the value '0.6.2' resembles a version string but is not inherently malicious",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a variable assignment with a seemingly random variable name and a string that looks like a version number. There are no inputs, outputs, or function calls. The variable name does not follow meaningful naming conventions and appears obfuscated, but this alone does not indicate malicious intent. There is no evidence of data leakage, code injection, or malicious activity. The code's simplicity suggests it is benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple variable assignment with an obfuscated variable name and a version string. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code appears harmless but may be part of a larger obfuscated or auto-generated script.",
