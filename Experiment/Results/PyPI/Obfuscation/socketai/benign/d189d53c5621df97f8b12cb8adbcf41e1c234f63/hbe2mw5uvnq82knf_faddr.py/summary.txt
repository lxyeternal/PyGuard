  "conclusion": "The script functions as a network data display utility with significant obfuscation. There is no concrete evidence of malicious activity such as data theft, remote code execution, or sabotage within this fragment. The high obfuscation warrants caution, but the current evidence suggests a benign purpose. The malware score is low, and the overall security risk is minimal but should be monitored if integrated into larger systems."
