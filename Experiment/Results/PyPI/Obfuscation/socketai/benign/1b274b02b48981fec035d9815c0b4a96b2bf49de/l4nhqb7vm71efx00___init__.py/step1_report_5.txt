{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up some metadata variables and imports specific functions from a local module, likely part of a larger package related to 'Rut' validation or processing.",
  "sources": "Variables assigned with strings (version, author, license), and import statement importing functions from a relative module.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks are evident; no external data output, network communication, or sensitive data handling is present.",
  "flows": "The code assigns static values to variables and imports functions; there are no data flows involving untrusted input or external outputs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of non-descriptive, obfuscated-like variable names (e.g., rYZIaTEJvNhrImvTNoGAcAvTsrkMFOxK), which could suggest obfuscation or concealment. No explicit malicious behavior detected, but the naming style is unusual.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines some module-level variables with static string values—version, author, and license—then imports functions from a sibling module. The obfuscated variable names could be a red flag but may also be auto-generated or stylistic. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or network activity. The import statement is standard for modular Python code. Overall, the code is simple, with no immediate security concerns but with some unusual naming conventions that could warrant further context.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign, mainly setting metadata and importing functions. The unusual variable names could suggest obfuscation, but there's no direct evidence of malicious intent. Overall, the risk is low.",
