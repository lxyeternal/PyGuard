{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a Python package/module related to handling 'Rut' (likely a Chilean national ID), with some metadata variables and import statements for core functionalities.",
  "sources": "Variables defining version, author, and license; import statement from a local module",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data or perform actions based on external input",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code only sets variables and imports functions",
  "anomalies": "The variable names are obfuscated or nonsensical, which may suggest attempts to hide intent. The imported functions are not used in the provided snippet, and the variable names do not reveal their purpose. The import path is relative, which is common, but without further context, it raises minimal suspicion.",
  "analysis": "The code defines some version and author metadata using seemingly random variable names, then imports specific functions from a local module. The __all__ list indicates the module exports functions related to 'Rut' validation or verification. There are no external inputs, no dynamic execution, no hardcoded credentials, nor any suspicious network activity. The obfuscated variable names could be an attempt to hinder code readability but do not inherently indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code is a straightforward module setup with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a simple module setup with obfuscated variable names but contains no malicious or suspicious activities. It is likely part of a larger, benign package, possibly related to 'Rut' validation.",
