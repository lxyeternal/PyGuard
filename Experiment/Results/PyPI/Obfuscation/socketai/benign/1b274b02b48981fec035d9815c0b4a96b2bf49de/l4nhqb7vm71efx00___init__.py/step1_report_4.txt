{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define some constants, import specific functions from a local module, and specify exported symbols for a package.",
  "sources": "Constants defined at the top, and the import statement from a local module (.main).",
  "sinks": "Import statement could potentially load malicious code if the module it imports is compromised, but not inherently suspicious.",
  "flows": "Constants are static data; no flow from untrusted sources. The import could execute code if the module is malicious, but this is standard behavior.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated-like variable names (e.g., rYZIaTEJvNhrImvTNoGAcAvTsrkMFOxK), which could be an attempt to hide intent or malicious code. The variables contain version info, author name, and license info, which are benign but unusual in this context. No other suspicious activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly consists of defining constants with non-descriptive, obfuscated variable names, and importing functions from a local module. The constants include a version string, an author name, and a license identifier, which are harmless. The import statement relies on a relative module, which could be malicious if the module is compromised, but this is standard practice. The __all__ list exposes specific symbols, which is typical for a package interface. Overall, no malicious behavior or security issues are apparent; the obfuscated variable names might be used to hide intent but are not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, containing only constants, imports, and export definitions. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscated variable names are unusual but do not indicate malicious intent.",
