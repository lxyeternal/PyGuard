  "purpose": "Metadata setup and import of functions related to RUT validation or processing.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version, author, license info; import from local module.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data or untrusted input handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static assignment and import only.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, which are unusual but not inherently malicious; no active code execution or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of metadata variables with obfuscated names, an import statement from a local module, and an __all__ list. No dynamic behavior, data handling, or network activity is evident. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not demonstrate malicious intent. The import is standard in package modules but warrants caution if the imported module is malicious. Overall, the code appears benign, with obfuscation being the primary concern but not indicative of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a module with metadata and imports. Obfuscated variable names are suspicious but not malicious in this context. No evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or code injection is present. The overall security risk is minimal.",
