  "purpose": "Validation, checksum calculation, and formatting of Chilean RUTs for verification and presentation purposes.",
  "sources": "Input data from constructor parameters, regex validation, and checksum functions.",
  "sinks": "Formatted strings, serialized data (CSV, XML, JSON), and exception messages.",
  "flows": "Input -> validation via regex and checksum -> normalization -> formatting and serialization.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names; minor bug in method 'pXFBTTqwpKogQaAcUkEaoIrjkEGLxJIu' referencing an undefined variable 'rut' instead of 'dUWUnpnbiomhmsYdkNSQaZsvjIZwGpWC'.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard Chilean RUT validation, checksum calculation, and multiple formatting options. Obfuscation appears stylistic rather than malicious. The bug is a typo that would cause runtime errors but does not indicate malicious intent. No external system calls, network activity, or data exfiltration are present. The validation logic is typical, and output serialization is straightforward. The obfuscation and minor bugs do not elevate the security risk. Malware score is correctly set to 0; obfuscation is moderate (~0.75); overall security risk is low (~0.2).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a utility for validating and formatting Chilean RUTs with obfuscated naming but no malicious behavior. Minor bugs are present but are bugs, not indicators of malicious intent. The security risk is low, and the malware score is appropriate. Obfuscation appears stylistic or for concealment but does not imply malicious activity.",
