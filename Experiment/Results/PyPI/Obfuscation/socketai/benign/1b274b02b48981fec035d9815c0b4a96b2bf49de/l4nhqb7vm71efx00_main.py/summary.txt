  "conclusion": "The code is a utility for validating and formatting Chilean RUTs with obfuscated naming but no malicious behavior. Minor bugs are present but are bugs, not indicators of malicious intent. The security risk is low, and the malware score is appropriate. Obfuscation appears stylistic or for concealment but does not imply malicious activity."
