  "purpose": "The code initializes and reads data from a SpaceMouse device, with callbacks for X and Y axes to print filtered data.",
  "sources": "Reading input data from the pyspacemouse.read() function.",
  "sinks": "The print statements within the lambda functions used as callbacks, which output data to the console.",
  "flows": "Input data from the SpaceMouse device flows through the callbacks that print filtered values, then back to the main loop repeatedly calling pyspacemouse.read().",
  "anomalies": "The callback functions are defined with obfuscated parameter names and are constructed via a function call that appears to generate code or strings dynamically. The lambda functions are simple, but the use of what appears to be a function returning a string or code (mbVkvmJttMtHMowHAxFtJwdPgEvLaMMZ) with a complex name and parameters may suggest obfuscation. There are no obvious hardcoded credentials or malicious system commands.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the pyspacemouse library and opens the device with specific callback functions for 'x' and 'y' axes. These callbacks are generated through a function call with a complex name, passing in a string identifier and a lambda that prints filtered data. The main loop continually reads from the device with a very short sleep interval. The obfuscated nature of the callback generation function and the use of unusual parameter naming could be suspicious, but there is no direct evidence of malicious activity such as network communication, data theft, or system modification. The code appears to be designed for capturing and printing device input data, which is typical for device handling but can be misused in malicious contexts if combined with data exfiltration or command execution. However, no such malicious activities are evident in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is primarily focused on reading and printing input data from a SpaceMouse device. Although some obfuscation is present in function and variable naming, there is no clear malicious intent or malware behavior detected. The code appears to be a legitimate device input handler with potential obfuscation for concealment, but it does not exhibit malicious or harmful actions within this snippet.",
