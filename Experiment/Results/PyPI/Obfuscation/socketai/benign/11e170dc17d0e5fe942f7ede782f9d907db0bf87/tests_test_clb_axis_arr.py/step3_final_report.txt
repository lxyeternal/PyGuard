{
  "purpose": "The code initializes a pyspacemouse device, sets up callbacks for 'x' and 'y' axes with obfuscated functions that print filtered data, and continuously reads device input in a tight loop.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from pyspacemouse via pyspacemouse.read() in an infinite loop.",
  "sinks": "The callbacks execute print statements, which output data to the console; no external data sinks or network activity are present.",
  "flows": "Input data from pyspacemouse.read() flows into the callback functions, which process and print the data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated function name 'mbVkvmJttMtHMowHAxFtJwdPgEvLaMMZ' with parameters that suggest dynamic or concealed behavior; high-frequency polling loop with sleep(0.0001).",
  "analysis": "The code is a device input handler that employs obfuscated functions to set up callbacks for axis data, which are printed. No network activity, data exfiltration, or system modification is evident. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not demonstrate malicious intent. The tight polling loop could impact system resources but is not malicious. The malware score is low (0.1), reflecting the absence of malicious actions. The obfuscation score is moderate (0.6), consistent with the complex function names. The overall security risk is low (0.3), primarily due to resource usage and obfuscation concerns. The code's behavior is benign, but obfuscation warrants cautious monitoring.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a device input handler with obfuscated callback setup. There is no evidence of malicious activity or malware. The obfuscation and high-frequency polling are potential concerns but do not constitute a threat. The overall risk is low, and the code appears benign, though obfuscation should be further examined if source trustworthiness is uncertain.",
