{
  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration using setuptools, defining metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description, static assignment of package metadata, and entry point definition.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "Static data flows from file reading and variable assignments into setup() parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated variable names used solely for static strings and paths; no dynamic or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with obfuscated variable names. It performs static configuration tasks without dynamic execution, network activity, or data manipulation. The obfuscation appears stylistic rather than malicious. No vulnerabilities, malicious payloads, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The high confidence scores are justified given the straightforward nature of the code. Obfuscation alone does not imply malicious intent, and the absence of malicious activity supports a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with superficial obfuscation. No malicious or security-threatening behavior is present. The obfuscation does not elevate risk or malware scores. Overall, the package appears safe, with scores reflecting minimal risk and no malware.",
