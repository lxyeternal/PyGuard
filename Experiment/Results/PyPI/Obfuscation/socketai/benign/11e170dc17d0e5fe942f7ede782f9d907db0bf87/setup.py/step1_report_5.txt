  "purpose": "Set up and configure the pyspacemouse Python package for distribution via setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description content.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or external effects are present in the code.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md content (source) is used in package metadata (sink) for long_description.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names (e.g., 'jpojewvUwfegolNamwozzUrdzQBolEnA'), but no malicious code detected. No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic execution, or suspicious imports. The code appears to be standard setup script with unconventional variable names.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and 'pathlib' modules. It reads the content of 'README.md' for the long description. Package metadata such as name, version, author, description, URL, classifiers, dependencies, and entry points are specified. All actions conform to typical Python package setup procedures. The obfuscated variable names seem to serve no malicious purpose and appear as obfuscation but do not impact functionality or security. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, data leaks, or malicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project with obfuscated variable names but no malicious intent or security risks detected. It performs expected setup tasks safely.",
