  "purpose": "CLI tool for interacting with SpaceMouse devices, listing devices, testing connections, and displaying version info.",
  "sources": "Imports from pyspacemouse module, command-line arguments, and user interactions.",
  "sinks": "Printing device info, reading data from SpaceMouse, and exception handling outputs.",
  "flows": "Input arguments trigger device listing or connection tests, data read from SpaceMouse flows to print statements.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, suspiciously named functions, and inconsistent exception variable ('nuWXrVrXLkfFODbKUqztuvJZZlXgdVfG' used but 'e' referenced). Use of a non-standard import with multiple complex symbols from 'pyspacemouse' raises suspicion but no direct malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a CLI interface for managing and testing SpaceMouse devices, with functions for listing connected devices, supported devices, all HID devices, and testing connections. It imports functions and variables from 'pyspacemouse' with obfuscated names, which might be a sign of deliberate concealment but is also consistent with common obfuscation practices or code generated by automated tools. Exception handling contains a variable mismatch ('nuWXrVrXLkfFODbKUqztuvJZZlXgdVfG' caught but 'e' used in print), indicating possible oversight rather than malicious intent. The code reads device data and outputs it directly, with no data exfiltration or network activity observed. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious commands are present. Overall, the code is a typical device management CLI with obfuscated naming but no clear malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a device management CLI for SpaceMouse devices with obfuscated naming conventions. There is no evidence of malicious activity, data leakage, or supply chain sabotage. Minor anomalies are present in exception variable use, but these do not indicate malicious intent. It appears to be a legitimate utility, though the obfuscation could be improved for clarity.",
