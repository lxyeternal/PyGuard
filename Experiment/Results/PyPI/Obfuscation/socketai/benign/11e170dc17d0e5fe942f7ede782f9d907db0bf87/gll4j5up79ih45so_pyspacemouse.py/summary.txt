  "conclusion": "The code functions as a device interface layer for SpaceMouse products, with significant obfuscation but no evidence of malicious behavior. The security risk is low, and the malware likelihood is negligible. The obfuscation does not inherently imply malicious intent, and the code appears benign for deployment in typical environments."
