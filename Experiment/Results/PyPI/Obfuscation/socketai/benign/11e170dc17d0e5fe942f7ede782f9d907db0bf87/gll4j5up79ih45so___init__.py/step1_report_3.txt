  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths identifiable in this single line",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('*') can be considered unusual or risky as it may obscure imported contents, but not inherently malicious",
  "analysis": "The code only contains an import statement from a local module. Without further context or code, there are no evident malicious behaviors or security issues. The import might introduce functionalities from 'pyspacemouse', but no malicious activity can be inferred from this alone.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet alone shows a simple import statement with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. The use of wildcard import warrants caution but is not malicious by itself.",
