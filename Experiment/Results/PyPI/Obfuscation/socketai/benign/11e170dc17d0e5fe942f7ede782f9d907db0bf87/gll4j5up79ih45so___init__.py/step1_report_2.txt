{
  "purpose": "The code imports all functions, classes, and variables from the 'pyspacemouse' module, likely for use elsewhere in the program.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads data from the 'pyspacemouse' module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present in this snippet; it's just an import statement.",
  "flows": "The flow is from the 'pyspacemouse' module into the current namespace via import *.",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'import *' can obscure which functions or data are being used, but this alone isn't malicious. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement bringing in all contents from 'pyspacemouse'. There is no indication of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code execution, or backdoors. Without additional context or code, this appears to be a standard import statement. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are evident. The import could be part of a larger package or application relying on the 'pyspacemouse' library.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this single line, there are no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears to be a straightforward import. However, without seeing the contents of 'pyspacemouse', I cannot fully assess the security of the imported module.",
