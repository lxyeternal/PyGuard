{
  "purpose": "Import all symbols from the local module 'pyspacemouse'.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no data input or external sources are explicitly read within this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any actions.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code only imports symbols from a module.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' can obscure imported symbols, which may hinder code clarity but is not inherently malicious. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no embedded logic, data processing, or network activity. The use of 'import *' is noted but not malicious; it can be a maintenance concern but does not pose security risks. No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are justified given the minimal and benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The use of 'import *' is a stylistic concern but not a security threat. The overall assessment aligns with the evidence, and no modifications to the scores or analysis are necessary.",
