  "purpose": "Import all classes, functions, or variables from the local module 'pyspacemouse'.",
  "sources": "Module import statement at the beginning of the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; this code only performs an import operation.",
  "flows": "No data flows; only an import statement, which does not involve untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The use of a relative import suggests this is part of a package, but the code itself is minimal and does not exhibit suspicious behavior. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement importing everything from a local module 'pyspacemouse'. There are no functions, data processing, or network activities. Since this is a minimal import statement, there are no evident security issues, malicious actions, or anomalies. The import may be used for handling hardware or device interactions via 'pyspacemouse', which is a legitimate use case.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this single import statement, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard import in a Python package. Further context would be needed to evaluate the module's content, but from this snippet alone, no concerns arise.",
