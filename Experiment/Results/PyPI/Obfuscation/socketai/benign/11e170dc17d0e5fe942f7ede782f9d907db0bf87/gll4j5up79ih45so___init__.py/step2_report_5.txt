  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess their accuracy, consistency, and implications.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code: a simple import statement, either `from .pyspacemouse import *` or similar.\n- No code execution, data processing, or network activity is present.\n- The use of `import *` is noted as potentially risky or obscure but not inherently malicious.\n- No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are observed.\n- Malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores are all low or zero, which aligns with the minimal code.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Accurate; it's just an import statement.\n- **Risk assessment:** Correct; no malicious activity.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, risk = 0, confidence = high (0.9).  \n**No issues.**\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correct; import * from a module.\n- **Potential concern:** Use of `import *` can obscure what is imported, possibly hiding malicious functions, but this alone isn't malicious.\n- **Risk assessment:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.1.  \n**The securityRisk is slightly elevated but justified given the obscurity of `import *`.**  \n**Score seems reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- Similar to previous, with emphasis on the wildcard import.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correct; no malicious activity, just a risky import style.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.1, confidence = 0.5.  \n**Appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- Similar assessment; no suspicious activity.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Accurate.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, confidence = 0.4.  \n**Reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- Same minimal import statement.\n- **Analysis:** Correct; no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.1, confidence = 0.8.  \n**Appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple import statement with no malicious activity.\n- The use of `import *` is noted as a potential risk but not malicious.\n- The malware scores are all zero, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- The security risk scores are slightly elevated (0.1) in some reports due to the wildcard import, which is reasonable.\n\n### **My final judgment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports — consistent and justified.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Given the minimal code, I would assign a very low risk score, perhaps **0.1**, mainly due to the wildcard import style which can obscure imported symbols but isn't inherently dangerous.\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type        | Final Estimate |\n|-------------------|----------------|\n| Malware           | 0              |\n| Obfuscated        | 0              |\n| Risk              | 0.1            |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code snippet is benign, and the reports' assessments are accurate. The only minor concern is the use of `import *`, which warrants caution but does not constitute a security risk by itself.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** If additional context or code were provided, further analysis might be warranted. But based solely on this import statement, there are no security issues.",
