  "review": "Let's analyze these reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation:**\nAll reports confirm that the code is a simple import statement: `from .pyspacemouse import *`. There are no additional code snippets, functions, or data flows present. This is a straightforward import, and no dynamic code execution or data processing occurs here.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n- No, the code itself does not contain any issues or malicious behavior. It’s a standard import statement.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports:**\n- The reports correctly identify that using `import *` can obscure what symbols are imported, which can be a maintenance or security concern in larger codebases. However, they do not attribute this as malicious.\n- The reports are consistent in stating that, based solely on this line, no malicious activity is evident.\n- No flawed reasoning or logical errors are apparent in the reports.\n\n4. **Score Justifications:**\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n- Security risk scores are very low (mostly 0.1), which is reasonable given the minimal context.\n- Confidence levels vary but are generally high (0.3 to 0.9), reflecting the limited scope but correct assessment.\n\n5. **Malware and Obfuscated Scores:**\n- All reports correctly assign `malware: 0` since there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, which is appropriate because the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n\n6. **Potential Risks and Assumptions:**\n- The reports assume that the import statement alone is benign, which is reasonable.\n- They note that without inspecting the `pyspacemouse` module, a full security assessment isn't possible, which is a prudent stance.\n\n7. **Overall Consistency and Reasonableness:**\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the analysis.\n- The conclusions are cautious and appropriate given the minimal code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0 — no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation observed.\n\n**Risk Score:** 0.1 — minimal risk, primarily due to the use of `import *`, which can be risky in larger codebases but not malicious here.\n\n**Additional Comments:**\n- The main concern with such import statements is maintainability and clarity, not security.\n- If further code or the contents of `pyspacemouse` were available, a more thorough review could be performed.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nBased on the provided reports and code snippet, I agree with the current scores. The code is benign, and the security risks are minimal. No changes are necessary unless additional context or code is provided.\n\n**My final estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the cautious but justified assessments in the reports.",
