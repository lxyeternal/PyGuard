  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine if the conclusions and scores are justified.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports are based solely on a single import statement: `from .pyspacemouse import *`.\n- There is no evidence of data flow, code execution, or embedded malicious code.\n- The use of `import *` is noted as potentially obfuscating what is imported but is not inherently malicious.\n- The reports consistently conclude that there are no signs of malicious behavior, which aligns with the code snippet provided.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n#### Report 1\n- **Purpose & Source:** Correctly identifies a simple import.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately states no malicious intent or security risks.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 (very low, considering no suspicious activity).\n- **Justification:** Valid, given the minimal code.\n\n#### Report 2\n- **Purpose & Source:** Accurate.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly notes that `import *` can obscure what is imported but is not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1.\n- **Confidence:** Slightly lower (0.3) due to the ambiguity of `import *`, but still reasonable.\n- **Justification:** Sound reasoning; no malicious activity detected.\n\n#### Report 3\n- **Purpose & Source:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately cautious but concludes no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1.\n- **Confidence:** Moderate (0.5), which seems fair.\n- **Justification:** No issues.\n\n#### Report 4\n- **Purpose & Source:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Recognizes the potential for usage elsewhere but finds no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.4, reasonable.\n- **Justification:** Valid.\n\n#### Report 5\n- **Purpose & Source:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Similar reasoning; no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1.\n- **Confidence:** High (0.8), justified given the simplicity.\n- **Justification:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified. The code snippet shows no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward import statement.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in most cases, which is reasonable for a simple import, as it could potentially hide malicious code if the module itself were malicious, but with no evidence, this remains low.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Scores:** I agree with the assigned scores.\n- **Additional comments:** The reports are cautious but justified. Without additional context or code, there's no reason to assign higher risk or malware scores.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions. The import statement alone does not pose a security threat.",
