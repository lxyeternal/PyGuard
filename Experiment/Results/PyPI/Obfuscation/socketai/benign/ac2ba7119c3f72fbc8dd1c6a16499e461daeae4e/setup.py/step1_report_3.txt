{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package using setuptools, defining metadata, dependencies, and configuration for packaging and testing.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info for Python version check, hardcoded package metadata, dependencies, and configuration parameters for setup().",
  "sinks": "No apparent untrusted data sinks; the code does not perform data output, network communication, or execution of external commands.",
  "flows": "sys.version_info influences conditional dependency inclusion; package configuration data flows into setup() parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names (e.g., DAOTfrukeSZJQiFhnEdyFfHdYxqsFtpb) and inconsistent formatting. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code logic.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily defines package metadata and dependencies for setup.py. The variable names are intentionally obscure, but they do not indicate malicious intent. The sys.version_info check dynamically adjusts dependencies for older Python versions. No code injection, network activity, or sensitive data handling observed. The obfuscation appears to be a code style choice rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names but no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a typical package configuration script with some obfuscation. No malicious or suspicious activity detected.",
