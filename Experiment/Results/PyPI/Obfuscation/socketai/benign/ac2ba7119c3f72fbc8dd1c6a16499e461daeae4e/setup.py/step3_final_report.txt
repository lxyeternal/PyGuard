  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script configuring dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads Python version info from sys.version_info; static variables defining dependencies and package data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or environment variable interactions observed.",
  "flows": "Conditional dependency inclusion based on Python version; static configuration passed to setup().",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated variable names; no malicious code or hidden logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with superficial obfuscation through variable names. It performs standard package configuration, including conditional dependencies based on Python version. No network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration is present. The obfuscation appears to be stylistic or for concealment but does not impact security. No hardcoded secrets or malicious logic are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with superficial obfuscation. No malicious activity or security vulnerabilities are detected. The obfuscation does not indicate malicious intent, and the script functions as intended for package configuration.",
