{
  "purpose": "This code sets up a Python package using setuptools, specifying metadata, dependencies, and configuration options for packaging and testing.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info (reads Python version), hardcoded dependency lists, setup() function parameters",
  "sinks": "setup() function parameters (such as package_dir, extras_require, test_suite, tests_require) which influence package installation and testing behavior",
  "flows": "sys.version_info influences conditional dependency addition; dependencies feed into setup() parameters that determine package behavior and environment setup",
  "anomalies": "Presence of non-descriptive variable names (e.g., DAOTfrukeSZJQiFhnEdyFfHdYxqsFtpb, WLGtiQiFlrbsKnFDWhiaYEdPACNbWfLl, TzVFrfiHfTgVDevmfjBeuuIghbQrTmZm) suggests obfuscation or generated code; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard setuptools to configure packaging. Variable names appear obfuscated, but they do not contain malicious instructions. The code reads the Python version to conditionally include dependencies, which is typical for compatibility. No suspicious network activity, code injection, or data leaks are evident. The setup configuration aligns with common package distribution practices. Overall, the code performs package setup tasks without any signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration with obfuscated variable names that do not indicate malicious behavior. No malicious or suspicious activity is present. It appears safe and typical for a Python package setup.",
