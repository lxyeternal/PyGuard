  "purpose": "Declare a namespace package using pkg_resources",
  "sources": "The __import__('pkg_resources') statement for importing the pkg_resources module",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks are present in this code",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only imports and declares a namespace",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no anomalies or malicious patterns detected; usage of __import__ and namespace declaration is standard",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkg_resources' module dynamically using __import__, then declares a namespace for the current package. There are no inputs, outputs, or data flows that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions. This pattern is common in namespace packages and does not indicate malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace declaration and import statement with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
