  "purpose": "Declare a namespace package for the current module using pkg_resources.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and calls declare_namespace(__name__)",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no data processing or external outputs",
  "flows": "Import of 'pkg_resources' leads to calling 'declare_namespace', which sets up namespace packaging but does not process untrusted data",
  "anomalies": "The code only performs a namespace declaration without any additional logic or data handling; no suspicious or unusual behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' dynamically using __import__, then calls declare_namespace(__name__) to establish a namespace package. This pattern is standard for creating namespace packages in Python, especially for older distributions or specific package arrangements. There are no inputs, data flows, or sink operations that could indicate malicious activity. The minimal code suggests it is a standard namespace declaration without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code simply sets up a namespace package and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a benign namespace declaration statement.",
