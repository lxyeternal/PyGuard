  "purpose": "Declare namespace for a Python package using pkg_resources.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it dynamically imports 'pkg_resources' via __import__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed or output; no data leaks or external effects occur.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only performs a namespace declaration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is a minimal, standard namespace declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' dynamically and declares a namespace with declare_namespace(__name__). It is a common pattern in Python packaging for namespace packages. No data handling, network activity, or malicious behavior is involved. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate given the benign and standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace declaration with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports correctly identify this pattern, and the scoring aligns with the benign nature. No adjustments are necessary.",
