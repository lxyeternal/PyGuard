  "purpose": "Declare the current package as a namespace package for modular distribution",
  "sources": "None explicitly; the code imports 'pkg_resources' and declares a namespace",
  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is only setting up namespace declaration",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; uses dynamic import and namespace declaration, which are common in namespace packages, but no malicious behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' dynamically and declares a namespace for the package, which is a standard practice for namespace packages in Python. There are no input sources, no data sinks, and no data flows. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The code's simplicity and standard pattern suggest it's used for package modularization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace package declaration with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
