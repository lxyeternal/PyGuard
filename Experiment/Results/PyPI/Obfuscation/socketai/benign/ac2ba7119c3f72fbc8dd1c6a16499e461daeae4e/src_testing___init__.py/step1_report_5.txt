  "purpose": "Declare a namespace package for the current module using pkg_resources.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'pkg_resources' module and calls 'declare_namespace' with the current module name.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks in this code.",
  "flows": "The code imports a module and executes a single function call to declare a namespace, with no data flow or user input involved.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and uses a common pattern for namespace packages. No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkg_resources' library, which is part of setuptools, and declares a namespace package. This pattern is typical for defining namespace packages in Python. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activity. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard practices for namespace declaration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace declaration using pkg_resources, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
