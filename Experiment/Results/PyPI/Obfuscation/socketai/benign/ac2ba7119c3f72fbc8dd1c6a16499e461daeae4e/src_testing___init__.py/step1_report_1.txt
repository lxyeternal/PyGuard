  "purpose": "Declare namespace for a Python package using pkg_resources",
  "sources": "__import__('pkg_resources').declare_namespace(__name__)",
  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "None",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; uses dynamic import, but this is standard for namespace packages",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkg_resources' module dynamically and declares the current package as a namespace package. This is a common pattern in Python packaging to allow multiple distributions to contribute to a single package namespace. No user input, network activity, or data handling is present. The code does not perform any data processing, I/O, or network communication. The use of __import__ with a string is standard and not malicious in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace package declaration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a minimal setup statement typical in Python package development.",
