      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Redis configuration and connectivity utility with high obfuscation but no evidence of malicious activity. The main concern is the obfuscation level, which warrants cautious review, but the code itself does not exhibit malicious behavior. The malware score should remain very low, and the security risk is minimal. Continuous monitoring and further static/dynamic analysis are recommended due to the obfuscation."
