      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code is primarily a configuration management utility for electrode models, with obfuscated code and routines that could be misused for malicious purposes, such as deleting configuration files. No active malware behavior like network exfiltration or remote code execution is evident. The main concerns are the unsafe YAML loading and destructive file operations, which justify a moderate malware and security risk score. The obfuscation level is moderate to high, but the code does not exhibit active malicious activity. Overall, it is a tool that could be exploited if misused, but in its current form, it is not actively malicious."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a complex, obfuscated visualization toolkit with no direct malicious activity detected. The moderate malware score (~0.2) reflects caution due to obfuscation and external dependencies. The high obfuscation score (~0.8) indicates deliberate concealment, warranting further review if used in security-sensitive contexts."
