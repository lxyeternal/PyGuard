{
  "purpose": "The code provides visualization functions for scientific and geometric data, including 2D/3D plots, surface visualizations, and animations, relying on numpy, matplotlib, and a custom utility module.",
  "sources": "Data is read from function arguments, object attributes, and external utility functions; no external data transmission or file I/O detected.",
  "sinks": "Data flows into matplotlib plotting routines; no network connections, file writes, or command executions observed.",
  "flows": "Input data from parameters and object attributes are processed into geometric and visual representations, then rendered via plotting functions.",
  "anomalies": "Variable and function names are heavily obfuscated or nonsensical, possibly for concealment; reliance on an external, obscure utility 'gtqzRugZrEXbmSECwmMKhCdkKDWIxNOi' from 'MEAutility.core'.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily for visualization, involving complex geometric calculations, shape plotting, and animations. No evidence of malicious payloads, network activity, or data exfiltration. The obfuscation and external utility suggest potential concealment but do not confirm malicious intent. Static analysis shows no active malware, but the high obfuscation and reliance on external, possibly proprietary modules warrant caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a complex, obfuscated visualization toolkit with no direct malicious activity detected. The moderate malware score (~0.2) reflects caution due to obfuscation and external dependencies. The high obfuscation score (~0.8) indicates deliberate concealment, warranting further review if used in security-sensitive contexts.",
