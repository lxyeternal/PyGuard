  "purpose": "Import version information and core and plotting modules from a package named MEAutility.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version(\"MEAutility\"), the relative imports from .core and .plotting modules.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly identified, as all data flows are within package imports; no external or untrusted data input points.",
  "flows": "Fetching package version, then importing internal modules, which is typical for a Python package initialization.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated-looking variable and module names in the core import, which could be suspicious but may also be benign.",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves package version info using importlib.metadata, then imports multiple components from internal modules. The variable and module names in the core import are non-descriptive and appear obfuscated. This pattern could indicate attempts to hide malicious code, but it could also be an internal naming convention. There are no external data inputs, network calls, or suspicious operations evident. No malicious code or supply chain attack indicators are immediately apparent based on this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be part of a typical package initialization, with obfuscated internal component names that could warrant further review but do not directly indicate malicious behavior. No clear malicious activity or security risks are identified here.",
