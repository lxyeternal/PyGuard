  "flows": "Version retrieval and internal module imports; no data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated or non-descriptive class/function names",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup tasks: obtaining version info and importing internal components. No evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection. Obfuscated identifiers could be benign or an internal naming choice; no malicious payloads or suspicious data flows are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with no signs of malicious activity. Obfuscated names are noted but not indicative of malicious intent. The overall security risk is low.",
