{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a Python package module, setting a version and importing specific components from internal modules for core functionality and plotting.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version() to read package version; internal module imports (.core and .plotting) for class/function definitions.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data, network transmission, or data exfiltration. No use of eval, exec, or subprocess with untrusted inputs.",
  "flows": "Version retrieval is a safe read operation; imported modules may contain sensitive code, but nothing in this snippet indicates malicious data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of seemingly obfuscated or non-descriptive class/function names (e.g., AWZqTPatmUQZbBkdxlgvXjuESYdYKOKb). Use of dynamic importlib.metadata to get version is typical, not suspicious. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it retrieves package version info and imports specific classes/functions from internal modules. The naming of imported items appears intentionally obscure, which might be suspicious, but could also be a form of obfuscation or just naming convention. There are no signs of malicious payloads, network activity, or data leaks within this snippet. The code does not execute untrusted input, nor does it contain any obfuscated or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a module initializer, setting version info and importing internal components, with no clear malicious or malicious-like behavior. The obscure naming might warrant further review of the actual imported modules, but based solely on this snippet, it appears benign.",
