{
  "purpose": "To facilitate the packaging and distribution of a Python project using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'setuptools' module and calls 'setuptools.setup()' if the script is executed directly.",
  "sinks": "The 'setuptools.setup()' function is a standard entry point for package setup; no untrusted data sink is present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the script executes setup functions without external input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; the code is minimal and standard for Python package setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup()' within a main guard, which is typical for Python packaging. It does not include any hardcoded credentials, malicious commands, or obfuscated code. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks. The code is straightforward and aligns with standard packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python packaging script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply invokes the setuptools setup process when run directly.",
