  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package using setuptools",
  "sources": "The script imports the setuptools module and calls its setup() function if executed as the main program.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function is a safe operation and does not lead to any data leaks or harmful actions.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows are present; the code simply invokes a standard package setup routine.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors are detected. The code is minimal and typical for Python packaging.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools, a common packaging library, and calls setup() within the main guard. It does not process input, handle environment variables, or perform network operations. The code appears to be a standard boilerplate for packaging and contains no suspicious or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward, legitimate package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
