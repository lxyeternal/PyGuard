  "purpose": "Setuptools setup script for Python packaging",
  "sources": "No explicit data sources; standard import of setuptools module",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or output",
  "flows": "No data flow; no source-to-sink pathways",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; very minimal and standard code",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'setuptools' library and calls 'setuptools.setup()' if executed as the main module. This is a typical pattern used in Python package setup scripts. The code does not contain any hardcoded credentials, obfuscated constructs, or suspicious behaviors. It does not read external input, write to files, or perform network operations. There are no apparent malicious or security-related issues in this minimal script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It is used for packaging purposes and contains no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
