  "conclusion": "The code is not malicious but contains suspicious behavior (executing system commands during install and obfuscated package name). The overall security risk is low but warrants monitoring. The malware score should remain low (~0.1), obfuscation score high (~0.7), and risk score moderate (~0.3)."
