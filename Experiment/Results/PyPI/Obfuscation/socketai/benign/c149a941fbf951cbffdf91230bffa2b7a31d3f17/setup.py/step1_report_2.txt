{
  "purpose": "Define and execute a custom installation process for the 'ccfxb3os7cj72j1o' package, including listing root directory contents post-install.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current working environment during the custom install process, specifically executing 'ls /' via os.popen.",
  "sinks": "The output of 'ls /' is printed, which is generally safe but indicates the code accesses system directories during installation.",
  "flows": "During installation, the CustomInstallCommand's run method executes 'ls /' and prints the result, involving reading system directory contents and outputting to console.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.popen to execute system command during package installation is unusual and can be exploited to run arbitrary commands if modified maliciously. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools for packaging and defines a custom install class that extends the standard install command. The custom run method calls the parent run method, then executes 'ls /' using os.popen and prints the output. This behavior is potentially suspicious because executing system commands during installation can be leveraged for malicious purposes, such as reconnaissance or executing unintended commands. However, in this context, it simply lists the root directory contents, which is benign but unconventional and may indicate a test or a footprint collection mechanism. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The use of os.popen instead of subprocess is a minor concern but not malicious by itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign listing of the root directory during installation, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. The use of system command execution during install is suspicious and could be exploited if the code were modified. Overall, no malicious intent or malware detected, but the behavior warrants caution due to its unconventional nature.",
