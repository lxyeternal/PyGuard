{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that executes 'ls /' during installation via a custom install command.",
  "sources": "The 'os.popen('ls /')' command executed within the CustomInstallCommand.run() method.",
  "sinks": "The output of 'ls /' is printed to the console; no other sinks such as network transmission or file writing are present.",
  "flows": "The code executes the system command during the install process, with the output printed directly, representing a source-to-sink flow that could leak environment info.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual execution of a system command ('ls /') during package installation; package name appears obfuscated; no malicious payloads detected; use of os.popen() instead of subprocess is outdated but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a benign filesystem listing during installation, which is unconventional and could be used for environment reconnaissance. No malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation beyond the package name are present. The command execution is suspicious but not malicious. The scores assigned in the reports (malware around 0.2, risk around 0.3) are appropriate. The package name obfuscation justifies a higher obfuscation score (~0.7). The overall behavior warrants caution but does not constitute malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is not malicious but contains suspicious behavior (executing system commands during install and obfuscated package name). The overall security risk is low but warrants monitoring. The malware score should remain low (~0.1), obfuscation score high (~0.7), and risk score moderate (~0.3).",
