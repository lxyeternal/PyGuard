  "purpose": "Import a specific function or object from a local module named 'todo'.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads from a relative module './todo'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; this is a simple import statement.",
  "flows": "The code imports 'ulPdukHJPbtopVPRxmhriJwOhWKaiAMm' from the local module, with no further data flow or execution.",
  "anomalies": "The imported name 'ulPdukHJPbtopVPRxmhriJwOhWKaiAMm' appears as a random, obfuscated string, which is unusual. The code is minimal and does not include any other logic or function calls. No use of environment variables, network operations, or dynamic execution is visible.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains a single import statement with an obfuscated module name. The imported object also has a non-descriptive, seemingly random name. There are no apparent data flows, malicious behaviors, or suspicious operations. The obfuscation of the identifier and module name may suggest an attempt to hide functionality, but with no additional code, this cannot be confirmed. Overall, this fragment appears to be a benign import statement, although the obfuscated naming warrants cautious monitoring if part of a larger codebase.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple import statement with obfuscated identifiers, which may be an attempt at hiding code but does not show malicious behavior or security risks by itself. No malware or suspicious activity is evident from this snippet.",
