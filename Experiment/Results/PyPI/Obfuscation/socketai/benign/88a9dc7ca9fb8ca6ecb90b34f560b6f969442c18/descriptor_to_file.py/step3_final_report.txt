  "purpose": "Protobuf descriptor processing utility that serializes descriptors into string representations for code generation or introspection.",
  "sources": "Descriptor objects passed into functions, including file, message, enum, and service descriptors.",
  "sinks": "Generated strings representing protobuf schemas, enums, messages, and services.",
  "flows": "Descriptor objects are converted into string snippets through various functions, with data flow confined within string processing.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation via variable names and code structure, autogenerated comments, complex control flow, but no signs of malicious code, external network calls, or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of functions that serialize protobuf descriptors into code snippets or documentation strings. Variable names are intentionally obfuscated, likely due to code generation tools. No external system interaction, network activity, or malicious payloads are present. The obfuscation appears superficial and typical of autogenerated code, not malicious concealment. The logic is straightforward, focusing on converting descriptor data into formatted strings for schema representation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate protobuf descriptor serialization utility, likely autogenerated, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation is consistent with code generation artifacts and does not indicate sabotage or malware.",
