      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate protobuf schema validation utility with high obfuscation. While no active malicious activity is detected, its capacity to process untrusted descriptors and obfuscated structure warrants caution. It should be reviewed further if used in security-sensitive contexts, especially regarding descriptor sources and logging practices."

Obfuscation appears superficial and typical of code generation artifacts. The malware score is appropriately zero, and the low security risk scores are justified. Overall, the code is safe and does not pose security concerns."
