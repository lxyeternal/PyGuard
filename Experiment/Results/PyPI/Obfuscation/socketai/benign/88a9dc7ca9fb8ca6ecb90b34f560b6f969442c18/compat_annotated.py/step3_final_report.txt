{
  "purpose": "Compatibility import pattern for 'Annotated', 'get_args', and 'get_origin' from 'typing' with fallback to 'typing_extensions' for older Python versions.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' within try-except block.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only performs safe imports without handling untrusted data.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or untrusted data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward, standard, and contains no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import specific functions from 'typing' for compatibility across Python versions. If the import from 'typing' fails, it falls back to 'typing_extensions'. This pattern is common and well-understood, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. No data flows, sinks, or sources involve untrusted data. The code is static, simple, and safe. All reports correctly identify this pattern as benign, with scores reflecting no malicious activity or obfuscation. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), and the malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe compatibility pattern with no malicious, obfuscated, or security risk elements. All reports are accurate, and the current scoring is appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.",
