  "purpose": "Import statements for typing annotations to facilitate type hinting in Python code.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module 'typing' and 'typing_extensions' to import specific functions and classes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or input sources are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths are present in this minimal code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns observed; standard conditional import for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import Annotated, get_args, and get_origin from 'typing'. If that fails due to ImportError (likely in older Python versions), it falls back to importing from 'typing_extensions'. This pattern ensures compatibility across different Python versions. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present; the code is solely for importing modules. No sensitive data handling, obfuscation, or malicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard compatibility pattern for importing typing features across different Python versions. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
