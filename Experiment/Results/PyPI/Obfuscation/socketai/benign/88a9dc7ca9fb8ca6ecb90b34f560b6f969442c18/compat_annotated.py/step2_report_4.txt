  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the claims, and assess the scores.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the same pattern: attempting to import specific functions from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' with a try-except fallback.\n- The code is straightforward, standard for compatibility purposes, and involves no data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious intent are indicated or evident.\n- The confidence levels are all 1, which aligns with the clear, common pattern described.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code correctness:** The code snippet matches the described pattern in all reports.\n- **Malicious activity:** None of the reports suggest any malicious behavior; the code is a compatibility pattern.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No errors, flaws, or mistakes are evident in the logic or reasoning.\n\n### Scores assessment:\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 in all reports, which is correct.\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports, which is correct given the benign nature.\n- **Security risk:** 0, appropriate for such a simple import pattern.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- The **risk score** is 0 across all reports, which is justified. The code is a standard, safe compatibility pattern.\n- No reason to increase the risk score; the pattern is well-understood and safe.\n\n### Potential discrepancies:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese scores align with the code's nature and the reports' assessments.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: **malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.**",
