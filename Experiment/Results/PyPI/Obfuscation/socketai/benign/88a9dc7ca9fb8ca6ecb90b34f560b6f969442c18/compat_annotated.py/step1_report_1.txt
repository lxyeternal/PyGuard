  "purpose": "Import type annotation utilities for enhanced type hinting in Python code.",
  "sources": "Attempt to import 'Annotated', 'get_args', 'get_origin' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions'.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data or external outputs are used in this snippet.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow present in this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Use of try-except for importing, which is standard for maintaining compatibility across Python versions. No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import specific type annotation functions from the 'typing' module, and falls back to 'typing_extensions' if the import fails. This is a common pattern to ensure compatibility with different Python versions (before and after Python 3.9). There are no signs of malicious activity such as code injection, data leaks, or suspicious behavior. The code is straightforward and intended solely for type hinting enhancements.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, non-malicious pattern for handling type annotation imports across different Python versions. No security issues or malware are present.",
