  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe a straightforward pattern of importing specific functions from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' with a fallback mechanism.\n- The purpose is compatibility across Python versions.\n- No untrusted data, data flows, or malicious activity are identified.\n- The code snippets are standard, well-understood, and common in Python projects.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The **original code** matches the described pattern in all reports.\n- There are **no errors, flaws, or malicious intent** in the code.\n- The **scores** assigned in each report are consistent with the analysis: all have malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and security risk at 0.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes, the code is a standard, safe compatibility pattern.\n\n- **Are there any errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic?**  \n  No, the reports correctly interpret the code's purpose and safety.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  Yes, all reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0, which is appropriate.\n\n- **Should any scores be adjusted?**  \n  No. Given the benign nature, scores are appropriate.\n\n- **Justify any higher risk scores:**  \n  Since all evidence points to benign, standard code, no justification exists for higher risk scores.\n\n- **Malware score consideration:**  \n  The code does not perform any malicious activity, so malware should remain at 0.\n\n- **Challenging assumptions about vulnerabilities:**  \n  No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code is purely for compatibility.\n\n- **Consistency of scores:**  \n  All reports are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation or suspicious code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign, standard, and safe. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain as-is.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep all scores at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**This code is safe, non-malicious, and a common compatibility pattern.**",
