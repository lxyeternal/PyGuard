  "purpose": "Import necessary typing utilities for type annotations, with fallback for older Python versions.",
  "sources": "The import statements from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or output operations present.",
  "flows": "N/A; only imports are performed, with no data flow involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code simply handles imports with a version check.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import Annotated, get_args, and get_origin from 'typing'. If that fails (due to an older Python version), it imports these from 'typing_extensions'. This is a standard compatibility pattern. No data input, output, or malicious constructs are present. The code does not perform any network operations, file modifications, or execute dynamic code. It is straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving solely to handle compatibility for type annotation utilities across different Python versions. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
