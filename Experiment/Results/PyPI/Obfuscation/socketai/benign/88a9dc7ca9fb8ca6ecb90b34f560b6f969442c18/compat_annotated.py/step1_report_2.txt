{
  "purpose": "Import typing annotations and utility functions for type analysis, likely used for type hints and introspection in Python code.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'typing' module or 'typing_extensions' module, depending on availability.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data processing or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or malicious data paths identified.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional import pattern to support different Python versions is standard; no unusual code or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import 'Annotated', 'get_args', and 'get_origin' from the 'typing' module. If the import fails, it falls back to importing from 'typing_extensions'. This pattern is typical for maintaining compatibility across Python versions prior to 3.9, which introduced some of these features natively. No data input, output, or processing occurs, and the code structure is straightforward with no suspicious or malicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard compatibility check for importing type hinting utilities and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It is a normal part of Python projects that utilize advanced type annotations.",
