  "purpose": "Import necessary functions from the 'typing' module or 'typing_extensions' as a fallback.",
  "sources": "Import statement reading modules 'typing' or 'typing_extensions'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data or system effects are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks since this is solely an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious code, or suspicious behavior detected in this minimal snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import 'Annotated', 'get_args', and 'get_origin' from the 'typing' module. If the 'typing' module is unavailable (which is unlikely in modern Python), it falls back to importing from 'typing_extensions'. This pattern ensures compatibility across Python versions. No input sources, data flows, or sinks are involved. The code is straightforward and typical for type hinting and compatibility handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign compatibility pattern for importing type hinting functions. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious anomalies, and poses no security risks.",
