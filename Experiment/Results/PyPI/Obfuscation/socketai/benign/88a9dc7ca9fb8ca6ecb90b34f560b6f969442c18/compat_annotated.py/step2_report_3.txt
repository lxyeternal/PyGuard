  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code pattern: attempting to import specific functions from 'typing' and falling back to 'typing_extensions' if necessary.\n- The code is a standard compatibility pattern used widely in Python projects.\n- No data flows, sinks, or sources involve untrusted data.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are reported or evident.\n- All reports assign a confidence of 1, with malware, obfuscated, and securityRisk scores at 0.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present in the code?**  \n  Yes. The code matches the described pattern, and all reports are accurate in their assessment that this is benign.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- **Any errors or flaws in the reports?**  \n  No. The reports are consistent, accurate, and correctly interpret the code as standard, non-malicious compatibility handling.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  - malware: 0  \n  - obfuscated: 0  \n  - securityRisk: 0  \n  - risk: 0\n\n  These are appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- The risk score is 0 because the code performs safe, standard imports with no malicious or suspicious activity.\n\n### Malware score considerations:\n- The malware score is 0, which aligns with the code's benign intent.\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code does not perform any dangerous operations.\n- The reports correctly identify the code as standard and safe.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Estimated malware score:** 0  \n- **Estimated obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Estimated risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate, and the scores reflect the benign nature of this code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is a common, safe pattern for maintaining compatibility across Python versions. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The current scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.",
