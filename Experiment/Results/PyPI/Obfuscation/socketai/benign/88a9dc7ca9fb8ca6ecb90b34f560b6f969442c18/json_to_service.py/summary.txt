  "conclusion": "The code is standard protobuf/gRPC scaffolding, likely auto-generated, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. Obfuscation appears superficial and typical of code generation artifacts. The malware score is appropriately zero, and the low security risk scores are justified. Overall, the code is safe and does not pose security concerns."
