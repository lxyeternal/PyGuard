  "purpose": "Helper function to create Python classes from in-memory protobuf Descriptor objects",
  "sources": "The function takes Descriptor, EnumDescriptor, or ServiceDescriptor objects as input parameters",
  "sinks": "The function returns dynamically generated classes or wrappers, potentially affecting class creation or modification",
  "flows": "Input descriptors are used to generate classes or wrappers, which are then returned",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard for protobuf class generation; no suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code describes a utility for creating Python classes from protobuf descriptors. It accepts descriptor objects and a class type, then returns dynamically created classes or wrappers. No suspicious or malicious operations, such as network communication, file access, or code execution, are evident. The function appears to operate solely within the scope of class creation based on provided descriptors, which is standard protobuf behavior. The docstring and argument structure align with typical protobuf class generation processes, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard helper for protobuf class generation with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs expected operations without any suspicious patterns.",
