  "purpose": "Helper utility to create Python classes from in-memory protobuf Descriptor objects, enabling dynamic message, enum, or service class generation.",
  "sources": "Descriptor, EnumDescriptor, ServiceDescriptor objects used as input parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, network activity, or file operations observed.",
  "flows": "Input descriptors are processed to generate classes or wrappers; no external data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names and placeholder comments suggest code obfuscation or auto-generation, but no malicious patterns identified.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard protobuf utility for dynamic class creation, with no evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. Obfuscated variable names are noted but are typical in auto-generated code and do not imply malicious intent. The reports consistently find no malicious activity, assigning malware scores of 0. Obfuscation scores are moderate to high, justified by variable naming. Security risk scores are low, reflecting the benign nature of the code. Overall, the code appears legitimate and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign protobuf helper utility with obfuscated variable names likely due to code generation. No malicious activity or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores are consistent with the analysis, with malware score at 0, obfuscation around 0.6, and low security risk (~0.2).",
