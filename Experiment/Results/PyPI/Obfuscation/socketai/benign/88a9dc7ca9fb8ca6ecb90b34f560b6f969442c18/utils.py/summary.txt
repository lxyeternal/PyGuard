  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate protobuf schema validation utility with high obfuscation. While no active malicious activity is detected, its capacity to process untrusted descriptors and obfuscated structure warrants caution. It should be reviewed further if used in security-sensitive contexts, especially regarding descriptor sources and logging practices."
