  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, compare the scores with the content, and determine the appropriateness of their assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Only import statements with obfuscated identifiers; no code execution or external effects.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0.8, Risk=0.2, Confidence=0.6\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly notes the obfuscation and lack of executable code or data flows. The malware score of 0 aligns with the absence of malicious activity. The obfuscation score (0.8) seems appropriate given the nonsensical identifiers. The security risk is low (0.2), which is reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to Report 1, with obfuscated import names, no data flow or external effects.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0.7, Risk=0.2, Confidence=0.6\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, only import statements with obfuscated names, no evidence of malicious activity. The malware score remains 0, which is appropriate. The obfuscation score (0.7) is slightly lower than Report 1 but still indicates significant obfuscation, which is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Obfuscated import names, no data flows or suspicious activity directly observable.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0.6, Risk=0.2, Confidence=0.6\n\n**Assessment:**  \nObfuscated identifiers are present, but no evidence of malicious behavior. Malware score of 0 is justified. The obfuscation score (0.6) is slightly lower, perhaps reflecting less suspicion but still notable obfuscation.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar pattern—obfuscated imports, no explicit malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0.8, Risk=0.2, Confidence=0.4\n\n**Assessment:**  \nObfuscation is high (0.8), consistent with the identifiers. Malware remains 0, which is justified given no evidence. Confidence is lower (0.4), perhaps due to the less detailed analysis, which seems acceptable.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Obfuscated import names, no data flow or suspicious operations.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0.8, Risk=0.2, Confidence=0.6\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the obfuscation score matches the pattern, and malware is rightly scored as 0. The overall assessment appears reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity is evident solely from import statements.\n- **Obfuscation Scores:** Slight variations (0.6 to 0.8) are justified based on the obfuscated identifiers.\n- **Risk Scores:** Consistently low (0.2), appropriate given the lack of active malicious behavior.\n\n**Potential Adjustments:**  \nNo significant changes needed. The scores are consistent with the observations.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.7 (average of the reports' scores, leaning towards moderate obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (low, given the lack of active threats)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe import statements alone do not demonstrate malicious intent, but the obfuscated identifiers warrant cautious review of the actual modules. No immediate security risks are evident from this snippet.",
