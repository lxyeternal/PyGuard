  "conclusion": "The code is a typical protobuf serialization and validation utility, with superficial obfuscation likely from code generation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain attack vectors. The malware score is set to 0, the obfuscation score is moderate (~0.65), and the overall security risk is low (~0.2)."
