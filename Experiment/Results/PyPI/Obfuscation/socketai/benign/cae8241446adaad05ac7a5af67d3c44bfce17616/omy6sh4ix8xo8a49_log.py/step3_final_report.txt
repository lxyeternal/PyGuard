  "purpose": "Configure logging with obfuscated variable names, setting levels, handlers, and providing functions to access and modify the logger.",
  "sources": "Logging configuration code, variable assignments, function definitions accessing or modifying the logger object.",
  "sinks": "Output to stdout via StreamHandler; no untrusted data sources or external inputs.",
  "flows": "Logger setup flows from variable definitions to handler configuration, and functions return or set logger level.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, but no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard logging setup with obfuscated variable names, no external input handling, network activity, or data processing. It only configures log levels, handlers, and provides accessors/modifiers for the logger. No signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or security vulnerabilities are present. Obfuscation appears stylistic, not malicious. The functions are simple and benign. No suspicious code or malicious intent is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign logging configuration script with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malware, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate. The malware score should remain at 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1). Obfuscation is high but justified, and no adjustments are necessary.",
