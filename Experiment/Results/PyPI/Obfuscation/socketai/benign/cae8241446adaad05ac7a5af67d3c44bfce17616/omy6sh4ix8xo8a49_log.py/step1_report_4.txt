  "sources": "Import statements for logging and sys modules; logger configuration; function parameters.",
  "sinks": "Logger level setting functions; output to stdout via StreamHandler.",
  "flows": "Initialization of logger and handler -> setting formatter -> adding handler -> setting logger levels -> functions to get logger and change log level.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names; no hardcoded secrets; no suspicious input reading or network activity; no malicious code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up logging configurations with obfuscated variable names, but all actions are standard logging setup procedures: creating a logger, adding a stream handler to output to stdout, setting formatters, and adjusting log levels. The functions provided allow access to the logger and to change its level dynamically. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or suspicious network activity. The obfuscated variable names may indicate an attempt to conceal intent but do not inherently imply malicious activity. The code does not handle any input data nor perform any operations that could be exploited for malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard logging setup with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a benign configuration script that manages logging levels and output formatting.",
