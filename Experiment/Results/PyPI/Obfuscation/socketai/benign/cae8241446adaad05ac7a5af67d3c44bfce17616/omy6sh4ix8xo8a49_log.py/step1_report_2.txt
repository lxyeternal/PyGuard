  "purpose": "Configure logging settings and log level adjustments for various modules",
  "sources": "Import statements for logging and sys; usage of logging module functions and global variables",
  "sinks": "Logging output to stdout, no external data sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "Logging configuration at the start, global variable access and modification functions",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable naming, no apparent use of untrusted input, no external data exfiltration or malicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up logging configurations, including formatters and handlers, for a Python application. The variable names are obfuscated, but they only reference standard logging components and modules. Functions to get the logger and set its level are provided, but they do not process or handle external inputs or data. No indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or system compromise are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is solely for configuring logging behavior with obfuscated variable names. It does not contain malicious logic, backdoors, or security risks. The obfuscation appears to be an attempt to conceal simplicity rather than malicious intent.",
