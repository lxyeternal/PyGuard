  "sinks": "Setting log levels for different modules, configuring log handlers and formatters.",
  "flows": "Imports and variable definitions set up logging, functions modify logger levels.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names, no clear user input or external data sources, and no network or file system interactions. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code evident.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up logging configurations, including handlers, formatters, and module-specific log levels. The variable names are intentionally obfuscated, but their use is consistent with standard logging setup. Functions provide access to the logger object and allow changing log levels, which are typical for managing log verbosity. No external data sources, network operations, or malicious actions are present. The code lacks any behavior that would suggest malicious intent, backdoors, or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard logging setup with obfuscated variable names, which does not inherently indicate malicious behavior. There are no signs of malware, suspicious network activity, or security risks. The obfuscation seems intended for code concealment but does not point to malicious intent.",
