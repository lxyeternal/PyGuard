{
  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for a Python package, handling version extraction and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv), reads from PKG-INFO file, and reads file system via glob.",
  "sinks": "None of the sources directly lead to unsafe sinks like network or file writing outside setup context.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments → Version parsing → Setup configuration; PKG-INFO reading for version info; glob for package data files.",
  "anomalies": "Unnecessarily obfuscated variable names; inconsistent or confusing code flow; uses sys.argv[-2] and sys.argv[-1] without thorough validation; potential for misuse if arguments are manipulated. No hardcoded secrets or obvious malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code processes command-line arguments to extract a version number, raising exceptions if missing, and falls back to reading PKG-INFO file for version info. The variable names are obfuscated but functionally standard for setup scripts. The glob function is used to gather package data. No network activity, file writes, or other malicious actions are present. The obfuscation appears to be superficial, with no indication of malicious intent. Overall, the script performs typical setup operations with some obfuscated variable names, but no malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names, no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. It appears to be designed for package version management and configuration without malicious intent.",
