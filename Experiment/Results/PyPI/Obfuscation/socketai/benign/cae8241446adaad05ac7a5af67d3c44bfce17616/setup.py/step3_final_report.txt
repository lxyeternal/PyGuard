{
  "purpose": "Standard Python setup.py script handling versioning and package metadata with obfuscated variable names.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments (--version, sdist), reading PKG-INFO file, globbing files in 'bin/' directory.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, network activity, or malicious code execution detected.",
  "flows": "Command-line args -> version extraction; PKG-INFO reading -> version setting; glob -> package data; setup() call with metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Use of nonsensical attribute 'os.WUUDDFYWESpbMbIYoaGqFIZXhyMKQYKf' which does not exist; heavily obfuscated variable names; fragile argument parsing.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical setup tasks with obfuscated variable names and nonsensical attributes, likely for concealment. No malicious behavior, network activity, or data exfiltration observed. Obfuscation appears superficial, intended to hinder readability but not malicious. The version handling logic is fragile but benign. No hardcoded secrets or external malicious calls are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, obfuscated setup.py with superficial obfuscation. No signs of malware or malicious intent. The high obfuscation score reflects variable name mangling, but overall security risk remains low. The code is standard and safe for use.",
