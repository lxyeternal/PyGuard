{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package, intended to handle versioning and package metadata during distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv), reads version info from a file ('PKG-INFO'), reads package files with glob, and potentially prints messages.",
  "sinks": "Print statement and exception raising; no direct data leaks or untrusted data sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Command-line args -> version handling -> reading PKG-INFO -> setup parameters",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names (e.g., MErvtJYHlPCUPDAPRBodBddxgWbyLIHs, bfVLbMojTBqRspXfeHQPxCgPESVnkPdv), inconsistent naming conventions, and unusual string handling. The code reads 'PKG-INFO' file to determine version info, which is standard. No hardcoded secrets or credentials detected. No suspicious network activity, no code injection, or malicious logic evident.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical setup activities with obfuscated variable names, which might indicate attempts at hiding code intentions but do not constitute malicious behavior. It handles version setting through command-line arguments and fallback file reading, which is standard. No suspicious functions, no external network calls, no backdoors or data theft mechanisms are present. Overall, it appears to be a normal setup.py with obfuscated variable names, possibly for code obfuscation or obfuscation of intentions, but no malicious intent is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard setup script with obfuscated variables, which could be an attempt to hide its intent but does not display malicious behavior or malware. It does not perform any suspicious activities such as data exfiltration, code injection, or network communications. The overall security risk is low.",
