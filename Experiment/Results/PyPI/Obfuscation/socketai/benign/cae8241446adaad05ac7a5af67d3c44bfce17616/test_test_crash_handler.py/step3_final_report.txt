  "purpose": "A test suite for a microservice that loads error reports, manipulates environment variables, and performs assertions on error data and server responses.",
  "sources": "Reads JSON error report file, environment variables, and possibly external modules via dynamic import.",
  "sinks": "Logging outputs, assertions on error report data, environment variable modifications, file operations.",
  "flows": "Source data (error report file, environment variables) flow into assertions and logging; dynamic import loads utility functions used in tests.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated imp.load_source, obfuscated variable names, dynamic import from suspicious attribute, environment variable manipulations, no network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a testing suite for error reporting and server responses, with obfuscation tactics such as dynamic import and variable name obfuscation. No malicious payloads, network activity, or data exfiltration are evident. The obfuscation appears to be for concealment or proprietary reasons rather than malicious intent. The environment manipulations are typical for testing scenarios. Overall, the code poses low security risk and no malware threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate testing utility employing obfuscation techniques but shows no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain sabotage. The malware score is 0, the obfuscation score is approximately 0.7, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2). These scores are consistent with the code's behavior as a controlled test environment with obfuscation but no malicious intent.",
