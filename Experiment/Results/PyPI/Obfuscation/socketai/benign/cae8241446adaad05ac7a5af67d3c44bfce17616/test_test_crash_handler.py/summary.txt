  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate testing utility employing obfuscation techniques but shows no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain sabotage. The malware score is 0, the obfuscation score is approximately 0.7, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2). These scores are consistent with the code's behavior as a controlled test environment with obfuscation but no malicious intent."
