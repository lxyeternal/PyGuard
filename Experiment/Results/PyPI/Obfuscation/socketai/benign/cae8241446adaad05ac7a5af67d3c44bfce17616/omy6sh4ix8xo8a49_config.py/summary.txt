  "conclusion": "The code functions as a typical configuration loader with some obfuscation in variable naming. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The main concern is the YAML loading method, which could be insecure if YAML files are untrusted, but this is a security best practice issue rather than malware. Overall, the code appears benign and intended for configuration management."
