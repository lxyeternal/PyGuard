{
  "purpose": "The code initializes a configuration loader class that reads YAML configuration files from various paths, supports environment variable substitution, and sets configuration attributes for use in a larger application.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (os.environ.get), reading YAML configuration file (open and yaml.load), accessing sys.argv and os.getcwd",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted configuration data assigned to class attributes; environment variables used for secrets substitution; no direct sink for untrusted data flows to harmful system commands or external network communication",
  "flows": "Configuration file path determination -> reading and parsing YAML -> setting attributes -> environment variable substitution (if env_secrets present)",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.environ.get to substitute environment variables for configuration secrets, which is typical; no hardcoded secrets observed; no suspicious file paths or unusual code structures; no obfuscated or dynamic code execution detected",
  "analysis": "The code loads configuration data from multiple potential file locations, prioritizing existing files. It performs environment variable substitution if 'env_secrets' attribute exists, which could hide secret values. The code employs standard modules (os, sys, yaml, pprint, logging) in typical ways for configuration management. No malicious behavior such as network activity, system modification, or data exfiltration is evident. The code’s purpose is to load and initialize configuration parameters securely, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a standard configuration loader with environment variable substitution. It does not contain malicious or suspicious behavior. Its design appears legitimate and safe, focusing on flexible configuration management without any signs of malware or security risks.",
