  "purpose": "The code initializes configuration loading from multiple potential YAML files, handling secrets via environment variables, and sets up internal configuration parameters for an application.",
  "sources": "File reads from various YAML configuration files, environment variables for secrets, and command-line arguments for configuration paths.",
  "sinks": "Loading and parsing YAML files, setting object attributes, substituting environment variable secrets into configuration attributes.",
  "flows": "The code reads configuration files (sources), processes secrets substitution (environment variables), and sets object attributes based on configuration data (sink).",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically loads configuration data without validation, uses eval-like YAML loading (potential security risk if untrusted YAML), and substitutes environment variables directly into configuration attributes without sanitization.",
  "analysis": "The script loads configuration data from multiple YAML files, prioritizing files found in specific directories or specified via parameter. It assigns configuration key-value pairs as object attributes. When 'env_secrets' attribute exists, it replaces attribute values that match environment variable names with their actual values, indicating possible handling of sensitive data. No suspicious code injections or malicious network activity are observed. The YAML loading with 'yaml.load' could be unsafe if YAML content is untrusted, but this alone isn't malicious. There are no backdoors, network communications, or malicious actions. The code appears to perform standard configuration management with secrets substitution, with no signs of malicious intent or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a configuration loader that reads multiple YAML files, supports secret substitution via environment variables, and sets internal attributes. No malicious behaviors, backdoors, or malware indicators are detected. The only potential concern is unvalidated YAML loading which could pose a risk if YAML files are compromised, but this does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the script appears benign and typical of configuration setup code.",
