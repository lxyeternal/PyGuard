  "conclusion": "The code functions as a sophisticated monitoring utility with obfuscation and detailed request analysis. While it does not exhibit malicious behavior, its complexity and data handling warrant cautious deployment, especially in sensitive environments. The malware score is low (0.1), and the security risk is moderate (~0.3), primarily due to obfuscation and data collection practices."
