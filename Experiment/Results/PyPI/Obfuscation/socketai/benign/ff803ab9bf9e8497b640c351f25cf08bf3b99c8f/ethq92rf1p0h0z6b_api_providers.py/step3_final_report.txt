  "purpose": "Defines complex type aliases with obfuscated variable names; no runtime logic.",
  "sources": "TypeVar declarations and union of callables involving async, generator, and sync functions.",
  "sinks": "None; code contains no data input, output, or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flow; purely type annotations with obfuscated variable names.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated variable names; no executable code or data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is solely for type hinting, with no runtime logic or data processing. Obfuscation raises suspicion but is superficial. No signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or network activity are present. Malware and security risk scores are low, consistent with the benign nature of static type definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as type annotations with obfuscated variable names. While obfuscation warrants caution, there is no evidence of malicious activity in this snippet. The low malware and security risk scores are justified. Further review of the entire package is recommended if part of a larger obfuscated codebase.",
