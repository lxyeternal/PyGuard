  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Obfuscated class names and static strings, no operational logic.\n- **Analysis:** The code defines custom exceptions and classes with static strings, no data processing or network activity. The import statement references an obscure module, which could be obfuscation or malicious. Static strings may be placeholders or malicious payloads.\n- **Conclusion:** Primarily obfuscated, no active malicious behavior evident. The high obfuscation score (0.8) suggests concern, but malware score (0) aligns with no direct malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0.8, Risk 0.2 seem reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1—obfuscated class names and static strings.\n- **Analysis:** No external input, output, or data processing. Obfuscation may be used to conceal malicious intent, but no active malicious behavior is visible.\n- **Conclusion:** Likely obfuscated code with no malware. The confidence in benign nature is higher here (0.8), and malware score remains 0.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0.8, Risk 0.2 are appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Obfuscated class names and static strings, suspicious import.\n- **Analysis:** No active data flows or malicious actions. The import name is suspicious, but no network or system activity is evident.\n- **Conclusion:** Obfuscated, but no direct malicious activity. The moderate confidence (0.6) and obfuscation (0.7) are justified.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0.7, Risk 0.2 seem consistent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Class definitions with static constants, no operational logic.\n- **Analysis:** Similar pattern—obfuscated names, static strings, no data flow or external interactions.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity, benign obfuscation. The confidence (0.7) and obfuscation (0.3) are appropriate.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0.3, Risk 0.2 are reasonable.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Structural class definitions, static attributes, obfuscated import.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious data flows or activity. Obfuscation may be intended to hide details but does not indicate malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** No active malicious behavior, just obfuscated structure. The confidence (0.8) and obfuscation (0.3) are justified.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0.3, Risk 0.2 are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, and based on the code, there's no evidence of malicious activity such as network calls, data exfiltration, or code execution. The obfuscation alone does not imply malware.\n- **Obfuscated score:** High in some reports (up to 0.8), justified by nonsensical class names, static strings, and suspicious import statements.\n- **Risk score:** Very low (0.2), consistent with the absence of active malicious behavior.\n\n### Final recommendation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malware)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.7 (moderate to high obfuscation, but no definitive malicious intent)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (low, primarily obfuscation rather than active threat)\n\n**Note:** The static strings and obfuscated import could be part of a larger malicious payload, but from this fragment alone, no malicious activity is demonstrated.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code appears to be obfuscated class definitions with static data, no active malicious behavior.\n- The scores are reasonable, but I suggest slightly lowering the obfuscated score from 0.8 to 0.7 to reflect that while obfuscated, there's no concrete malicious activity.\n- Malware remains at 0, and risk remains low.\n\n**Final suggested scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.7\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis of the provided code snippets and reports.",
