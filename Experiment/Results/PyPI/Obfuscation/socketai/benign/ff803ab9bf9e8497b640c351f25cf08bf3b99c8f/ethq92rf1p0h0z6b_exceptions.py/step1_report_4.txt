{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define custom exception classes and some classes with static string attributes, possibly for configuration or identifiers.",
  "sources": "No input reading or external data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as data transmission, file writing, or execution are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of seemingly obfuscated or placeholder class names and variables, with minimal logic. Import from a non-standard module 'di.api.dependencies'. Some classes store string constants that may serve as identifiers or keys. The import name appears nonsensical, which could indicate obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly defines several custom exception classes inheriting from a base exception, with some classes storing string constants and others storing lists of objects from a custom module. There is no data input, output, or network activity. The import statement references a likely third-party or internal module, but its name is nonsensical and potentially obfuscated. The classes do not perform any operations, data processing, or network communication. The string constants could be used as identifiers, keys, or configuration values. The overall structure suggests code meant for configuration, exception handling, or obfuscation rather than active malicious behavior. No signs of data leaks, code injection, or malicious payloads are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists primarily of class definitions with no active or suspicious behavior. The import statement and obfuscated class/variable names could be attempts at concealment but do not indicate malicious activity based solely on this code. Overall, it appears benign but possibly obfuscated or part of a larger, more complex system.",
