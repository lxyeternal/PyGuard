  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes and hold constants or configuration data within classes.",
  "sources": "Class initializations, class attribute assignments, and import statements.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data processing or external data output observed.",
  "flows": "No clear data flows from external inputs to sensitive sinks; classes only define structure and constants.",
  "anomalies": "Import statement references an obfuscated module name; multiple classes inherit from a custom exception. Many class attributes are assigned static strings, potentially used as constants.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class definitions, some inheriting from a custom exception class. Several classes initialize with message and list parameters, but do not process or manipulate data in any suspicious manner. The import path appears obfuscated, which may suggest an attempt to hide functionality. All attributes assigned are static strings, likely constants, with no indication of malicious code such as data exfiltration, network activity, or code execution. There are no functions or methods executing external commands, handling sensitive data, or implementing dynamic code execution. Overall, the code appears to be a structural setup for exception handling and constants without any suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is primarily structural with class definitions and static attributes. There is no evidence of malicious intent, suspicious data flows, or harmful behavior. The obfuscated import might be noteworthy but does not necessarily imply malicious activity based solely on this snippet.",
