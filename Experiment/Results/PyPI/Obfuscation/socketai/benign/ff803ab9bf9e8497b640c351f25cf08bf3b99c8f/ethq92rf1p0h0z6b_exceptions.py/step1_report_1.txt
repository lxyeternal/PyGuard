{
  "purpose": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes and classes containing static string attributes, with no apparent operational logic or data processing.",
  "sources": "No explicit input sources such as network, files, or environment variables; no external data is read.",
  "sinks": "No data outputs, network calls, or data leaks observed; no untrusted data is propagated to sensitive sinks.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted inputs leading to critical operations; the code mainly defines classes and static variables.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated or nonsensical class and variable names, and the inclusion of seemingly arbitrary static string attributes. The import statement references an obscure module, potentially indicating obfuscation or misuse.",
  "analysis": "The code is composed mainly of class definitions for custom exceptions and classes with static string attributes. The imports reference a module with a non-standard name, which could suggest obfuscation or malicious intent. No input reading, data processing, or network communication is evident. The static strings do not appear to serve any functional purpose in this snippet but could be placeholders or malicious payloads. The structure lacks meaningful logic, and the class names are nonsensical, possibly indicating obfuscation or attempt to hide malicious intent. There are no typical malware behaviors such as network activity, file manipulation, or credential access.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be primarily obfuscated or placeholder class definitions with static attributes and custom exception classes. No malicious activity or security risks are evident within this fragment. The unusual naming and import could suggest an attempt at obfuscation, but based on the provided code alone, it does not demonstrate malicious behavior or security threats.",
