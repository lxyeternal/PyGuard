  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, and overall security risk.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  The code only defines interfaces with obfuscated names and an unusual __future__ import string. No executable code, data handling, or external interactions are present.  \n- **Errors or Flaws?**  \n  The use of a non-standard, obscure string in the __future__ import is suspicious but syntactically valid. It appears to be obfuscation or an attempt to evade static analysis.  \n- **Scores and Justification:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0.8 — high, due to obfuscated identifiers and strange import.  \n  - Risk: 0.1 — minimal, as no active threat is evident.  \n  These seem reasonable given the context.  \n- **Conclusion:**  \n  Mostly benign interface definitions with obfuscation. No evidence of malware or active security risk.  \n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  Similar to Report 1, with obfuscated class/method names and a suspicious import.  \n- **Errors or Flaws?**  \n  The import source 'di._task' could be legitimate or malicious; the obfuscation raises suspicion but isn't conclusive.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0.2 — slightly higher, perhaps due to suspicion, but no direct malicious activity.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0.8 — high, consistent with obfuscation.  \n  - Risk: 0.2 — still low, as no active threat.  \n  These are reasonable, considering the obfuscation and lack of concrete malicious actions.  \n- **Conclusion:**  \n  Obfuscated interface code with potential concealment but no evident malicious behavior.  \n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  Obfuscated identifiers and unusual import, similar pattern.  \n- **Errors or Flaws?**  \n  No actual vulnerabilities or malicious activity; only interface definitions.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — no malware detected.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0.7 — high, due to naming and import obfuscation.  \n  - Risk: 0.2 — low, as no active threat.  \n  These are appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:**  \n  Similar to previous reports, mainly obfuscation without malicious intent.  \n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  Obfuscated class/method names, no executable logic.  \n- **Errors or Flaws?**  \n  No data leaks or malicious actions observed.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — no malware.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0.9 — very high, consistent with the pattern.  \n  - Risk: 0.2 — low.  \n  Reasonable given the obfuscation.  \n- **Conclusion:**  \n  Likely auto-generated or intentionally obscured interface code, no malicious activity.  \n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  Obfuscated identifiers and import, no runtime logic.  \n- **Errors or Flaws?**  \n  No malicious activity, just obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — no malware.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0.9 — very high, consistent with other reports.  \n  - Risk: 0 — no active risk.  \n  Appropriate.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports show no concrete evidence of malicious activity. The slightly elevated malware scores (0.2) in some reports seem to reflect suspicion due to obfuscation, but not actual malware.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** Consistently high across all reports, as expected given the obfuscated identifiers and strange import strings.  \n- **Risk Score:** Remains low, as no active exploits, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are observed.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The obfuscation is suspicious but not sufficient to classify as malware.\n- The unusual __future__ import string is a red flag but does not cause harm by itself.\n- No changes needed to the scores based on the provided information.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.8 — high, due to obfuscation patterns.  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 — low, consistent with the absence of active threats.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code appears to be heavily obfuscated interface definitions, possibly auto-generated or intentionally concealed. While obfuscation can be a tactic to hide malicious intent, in this case, no evidence supports active malware or security risks. The high obfuscation scores are justified, but the malware score should remain at zero given the lack of malicious actions.",
