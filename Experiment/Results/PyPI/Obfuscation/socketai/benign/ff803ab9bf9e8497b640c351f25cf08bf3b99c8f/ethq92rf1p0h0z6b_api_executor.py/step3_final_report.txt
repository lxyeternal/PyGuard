{
  "purpose": "Defines interface protocols and type aliases with obfuscated identifiers, likely for dependency injection or modular architecture.",
  "sources": "Import from __future__ with a nonsensical string, class and method definitions with obfuscated names.",
  "sinks": "No data input/output, no external interactions, no untrusted data flows present.",
  "flows": "N/A – code only defines interfaces without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated import string, nonsensical class/method names, absence of executable logic, use of internal module di._task.",
  "analysis": "The code is heavily obfuscated interface definitions with no active malicious behavior. The import string from __future__ is syntactically valid but suspicious. No data leaks, code injections, or network activity are evident. The obfuscation could be used to conceal malicious intent elsewhere, but within this fragment, no malicious activity is demonstrated. The scores assigned in the reports align with this assessment, with malware scores at zero or very low, and high obfuscation scores justified by naming and import string complexity. The low security risk scores are appropriate given the lack of active threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign, heavily obfuscated interface definitions with no evidence of malicious behavior. The obfuscation warrants caution, but no active malicious activity is observable. The current scores are appropriate; malware score should remain at 0, obfuscation high (~0.8–0.9), and risk low (~0.1–0.2). Further context or dynamic analysis of related modules is recommended for comprehensive assessment.",
