  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign, heavily obfuscated interface definitions with no evidence of malicious behavior. The obfuscation warrants caution, but no active malicious activity is observable. The current scores are appropriate; malware score should remain at 0, obfuscation high (~0.8–0.9), and risk low (~0.1–0.2). Further context or dynamic analysis of related modules is recommended for comprehensive assessment."
