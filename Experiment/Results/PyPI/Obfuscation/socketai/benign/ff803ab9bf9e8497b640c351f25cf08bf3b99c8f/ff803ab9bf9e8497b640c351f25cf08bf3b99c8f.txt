      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate dependency management framework but employs obfuscation and dynamic code execution that could be exploited if inputs are malicious. While no direct malicious activity is evident, the pattern warrants caution and further review to ensure safety, especially regarding input sanitization and potential injection vectors."

The high obfuscation warrants caution, but the absence of active malicious activity suggests a low security threat. Monitoring is recommended if part of a larger system, especially considering the suspicious import, but no immediate action is necessary based on this code alone."

      "conclusion": "While the code is complex and heavily obfuscated, there is no concrete evidence of malicious behavior in this fragment. The obfuscation and dynamic dependency resolution warrant further review, especially of imported modules and external dependencies. The malware score is low (0.1), reflecting minimal suspicion but acknowledging the potential to conceal malicious actions. The obfuscation score remains high (0.8), and the overall security risk is moderate (0.4). Continuous monitoring and further dynamic analysis are recommended to ensure safety."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign, heavily obfuscated interface definitions with no evidence of malicious behavior. The obfuscation warrants caution, but no active malicious activity is observable. The current scores are appropriate; malware score should remain at 0, obfuscation high (~0.8–0.9), and risk low (~0.1–0.2). Further context or dynamic analysis of related modules is recommended for comprehensive assessment."
