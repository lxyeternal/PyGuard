  "purpose": "Minimal import statement from an internal module with obfuscated identifiers and __all__ declaration, likely defining public API symbols.",
  "sources": "Import statements from di._container module, reading obfuscated identifiers.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, no data flow, network activity, or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "Import from di._container to local namespace; no data flow or external sink identified.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated, nonsensical identifiers; no executable logic; only static import and __all__ declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static import statement with obfuscated names, which could be auto-generated or intentionally obscured. No runtime logic, data flow, or network activity is present. The obfuscation raises suspicion but is common in internal or auto-generated code. The absence of malicious functions, data leaks, or external communication indicates a benign intent. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware and security risks are minimal given the lack of active behavior. The code's simplicity and static nature suggest low security concern, though further review of the actual 'di._container' module is recommended to confirm the nature of the imported symbols.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet is a benign, minimal import declaration with obfuscated identifiers. While obfuscation warrants caution, there is no evidence of malicious activity or security risk in this fragment. Further investigation into the actual module is advised, but this specific code appears safe.",
