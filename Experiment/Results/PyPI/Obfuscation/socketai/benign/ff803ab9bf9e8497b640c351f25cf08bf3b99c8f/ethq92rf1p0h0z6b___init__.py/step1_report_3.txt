  "purpose": "Import specific classes and functions from the di._container module for use elsewhere in the package.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing symbols from di._container module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are explicitly present; no user input handling or data output observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external input to sensitive operations; primarily static import statement.",
  "anomalies": "Imported symbols have obfuscated or non-descriptive names, which could indicate an attempt to hide functionality, but this alone is not conclusive.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement bringing specific symbols into the namespace and an __all__ declaration defining exported symbols. The imported symbols have intentionally obfuscated names, which could be a sign of malicious concealment or simply code obfuscation. There are no functions, data processing, or network activity. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns are present. The code appears to be a standard module import with obfuscated symbol names, offering no direct evidence of malicious intent. Without additional context or code, no malicious activity is identifiable from this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a simple import statement with an __all__ declaration. The use of obfuscated symbol names warrants cautious review of the actual 'di._container' module for malicious code, but this fragment alone does not contain any malicious behavior.",
