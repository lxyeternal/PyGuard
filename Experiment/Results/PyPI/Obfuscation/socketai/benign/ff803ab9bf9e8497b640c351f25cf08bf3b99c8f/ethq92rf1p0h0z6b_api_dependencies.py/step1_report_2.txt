{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define protocols, generic classes, and data structures related to dependency injection and type handling, likely for a larger dependency management system.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'inspect' and 'typing' modules; external modules 'di._utils.types', 'di.api.providers', and 'di.api.scopes'. The code reads class definitions, method signatures, and type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks such as network calls, file operations, environment variable access, or execution of untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow paths are observable; the code mainly sets up class structures and protocol definitions without data processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code contains only class and protocol definitions with standard type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code is mainly type and protocol declarations for a dependency injection system. It uses standard Python typing and inspection features. No dynamic execution, code injection, or malicious behavior is present. External imports are type hints and protocol definitions, not suspicious network or file operations. No obfuscated code or hidden payloads are identified. The structure and content are consistent with legitimate dependency management patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup for dependency injection and type protocols, with no malicious behavior or security risks evident. It does not perform any harmful actions or data leaks.",
