{
  "purpose": "Define dependency injection interfaces, protocols, and data structures for a framework, with obfuscated class and variable names.",
  "sources": "Class and method definitions, property accessors, and type annotations within the code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, external input, network, or file operations are present; code is purely structural.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code does not process external input or perform system interactions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names, which could hinder readability but do not indicate malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class and protocol definitions related to dependency injection, with obfuscated naming. It does not include any external data handling, network communication, or system modifications. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are evident. The obfuscation appears to be a naming choice rather than malicious intent. The malware score is zero, and the security risk is minimal, justified by the structural nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as part of a dependency injection framework, with obfuscated identifiers likely for internal or auto-generated purposes. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.",
