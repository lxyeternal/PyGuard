  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet, the described purpose, and the security implications.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code conditionally imports `Annotated`, `get_args`, and `get_origin` based on Python version.\n- It imports a function `xzeNHdIeMRvKrIhDYMWACnNFEJKeivFO` from `di._utils.inspect`.\n- Defines a generator function that, given a type and a marker class, yields instances of that marker from `Annotated` type hints.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code logic appears correct for extracting markers from `Annotated` types.\n- The import from `di._utils.inspect` is obscure, with an obfuscated function name, which could be suspicious.\n- Variable names are nonsensical, which might be obfuscation.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- No functional errors are evident.\n- The obfuscated import and variable names are suspicious but not necessarily malicious.\n- No evidence of code that processes untrusted data, performs network activity, or modifies system state.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports, which aligns with no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** Ranges from 0.3 to 0.8, reflecting varying suspicion about obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** Mostly 0.2 or 0.1, indicating low security risk, which seems appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- The code is a utility for type inspection, not executing untrusted code or handling sensitive data.\n- The obfuscation and obscure import source could be red flags but do not, on their own, indicate malicious intent.\n- No external communication, data exfiltration, or system modification is present.\n\n### Assumptions and claims:\n- The reports correctly identify the purpose and logic.\n- The suspicion mainly revolves around obfuscation and obscure imports, which could be legitimate or malicious depending on context.\n\n### Consistency:\n- Scores are consistent with the analysis: malware remains at 0, obfuscation is acknowledged, and risk is low.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- The code appears to be a benign utility for extracting markers from annotated types.\n- The obfuscation and private module import are suspicious but not conclusive evidence of malicious intent.\n- No evidence of supply chain attack or malware.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendation:\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.6 (moderate suspicion due to variable names and import)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (low, based on current analysis)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a type annotation utility with obfuscated elements. While obfuscation can be a red flag, there is no evidence of malicious behavior. The supply chain security risk appears minimal based on this snippet.\n\n---\n\n**Would you like me to generate a detailed report summary or further analyze potential attack vectors?**",
