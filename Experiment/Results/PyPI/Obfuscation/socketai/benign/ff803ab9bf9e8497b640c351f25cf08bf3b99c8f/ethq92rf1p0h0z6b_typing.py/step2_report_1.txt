  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the associated code snippet.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code is a utility that inspects Python type annotations, specifically `Annotated` types.\n- It conditionally imports `Annotated`, `get_args`, and `get_origin` based on Python version.\n- It imports a function with an obfuscated name from `di._utils.inspect`.\n- The main function, `wdOoVKoOQevSVELjhSIJQwrpPwUZcVUY`, checks if a type is `Annotated`, then iterates over its arguments in reverse, yielding instances of a specified marker class.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code appears to perform legitimate type inspection tasks.\n- No evidence of malicious code, network activity, or data exfiltration.\n- The import from `di._utils.inspect` is obscure, but without further context, it could be a legitimate utility function or part of an obfuscated codebase.\n- Variable names are nonsensical, which suggests obfuscation but not necessarily malicious intent.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:\n- No explicit errors are present.\n- The obfuscated variable names hinder readability but do not impact functionality.\n- The import of an internal or private module could be a concern if untrusted, but not inherently malicious.\n- The function's logic is sound for its purpose.\n\n### Score Review:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** Scores range from 0.3 to 0.8; given the variable names and import, a higher obfuscation score is justified.\n- **Risk Score:** Mostly low (~0.2), which seems reasonable given the benign analysis.\n\n### Justification for Risk and Malware Scores:\n- The risk score is low because the code is a utility function with no evident malicious behavior.\n- The malware score remains at 0 across reports, which is appropriate.\n- Obfuscation is moderate to high, which warrants a higher obfuscated score.\n\n### Potential Inconsistencies:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis: no malware, benign purpose, obfuscation present.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n**Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n**Obfuscated Score:** 0.7 — variable names and import source suggest obfuscation.\n**Risk Score:** 0.2 — low, as the code is a utility with no apparent security issues.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The obscure import source warrants verification to ensure it’s from a trusted utility library.\n- The obfuscation could be intentional for proprietary reasons or to hinder reverse engineering but does not indicate malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the provided code and reports, I concur that this is a benign utility function for inspecting annotated types, with obfuscation but no malicious activity. The scores should reflect this: low risk, no malware, moderate obfuscation.",
