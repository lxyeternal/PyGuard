  "purpose": "Utility for inspecting Python type annotations, specifically extracting marker instances from Annotated types.",
  "sources": "Type annotations (get_args, get_origin), internal module import from di._utils.inspect",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data leaks, network activity, or system modifications observed",
  "flows": "Input type annotation -> get_args() -> iteration over args in reverse -> isinstance check -> yield marker instances",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, obscure import from di._utils.inspect with a non-descriptive function name",
  "analysis": "The code performs a legitimate task of extracting marker instances from Annotated type hints, with conditional imports based on Python version. The import from di._utils.inspect is obscure, and variable names are nonsensical, indicating obfuscation. No malicious code, network activity, or data exfiltration is evident. The logic is sound and does not process untrusted data or perform unsafe operations. The malware score is 0, consistent with no malicious activity. The obfuscation score is moderate to high (~0.7), justified by variable naming and import obscurity. The security risk score is low (~0.2), as the code is a benign utility without external communication or system impact.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for inspecting annotated types, with obfuscation but no evidence of malicious intent or supply chain compromise. The scores should reflect low malware risk, moderate obfuscation, and low overall security risk.",
