{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to analyze Python type annotations, specifically to extract markers of a certain class from Annotated type hints.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from type annotations using get_origin and get_args functions on annotated types.",
  "sinks": "The code does not appear to write or transmit untrusted data directly; it mainly processes annotations. No sinks for data leaks or external communication are present.",
  "flows": "The function checks if a type annotation is Annotated, then iterates over the annotation arguments in reverse order to find instances of a specific marker class.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated variable names, no direct malicious activity, and no external data transmission. The code’s purpose is clear and benign. No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious imports or functions. The imported module's name appears arbitrary but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a safe and standard operation: inspecting type annotations for specific markers. Variable names are intentionally obfuscated, which can sometimes be suspicious, but in this context, it appears to be an obfuscation technique rather than malicious code. No data leaks, external network operations, or harmful functions are present. The imported module from di._utils.inspect is not inherently malicious; without additional context, it appears to be a utility module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for inspecting annotated types, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. Its obfuscation seems intentional for obscurity rather than malicious intent.",
