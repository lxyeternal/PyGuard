  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, obfuscated scaffold for cloud resource management with no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The high obfuscation warrants a moderate score but does not imply malicious intent. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score is appropriately zero."
