  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate IP/subnet utility module with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. While obfuscation warrants cautious review, it does not, in this context, indicate malicious intent. The overall security risk is minimal, and the malware score remains at 0."
