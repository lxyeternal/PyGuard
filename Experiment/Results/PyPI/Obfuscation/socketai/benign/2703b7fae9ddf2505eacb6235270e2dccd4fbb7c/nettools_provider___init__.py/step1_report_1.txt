  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform some data processing or utility functions, but without additional context, the exact goal is unclear.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from variables, potentially from user input, environment variables, or external files (not explicitly shown).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, file writes, or system commands if present, but none are explicitly identifiable in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions, but without specific code snippets, exact source-to-sink paths cannot be determined.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation are detected. The code uses standard syntax and constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious constructs. No suspicious network activity, credential handling, or system modifications are evident. Usage of third-party libraries is not inherently malicious, and the code structure appears standard.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no clear indications of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code appears benign, but without further context or actual code snippets, this assessment cannot be absolute.",
