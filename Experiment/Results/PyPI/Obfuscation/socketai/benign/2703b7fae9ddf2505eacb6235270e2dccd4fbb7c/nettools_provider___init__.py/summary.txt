  "conclusion": "Most code is benign with low security risk and no malware. The only notable case involves obfuscated code with dynamic execution, warranting a higher suspicion score. Adjusting the malware score for this case from 0.4 to 0.6 improves alignment with the observed obfuscation and potential for malicious use. Overall, the assessments are consistent and appropriate."
