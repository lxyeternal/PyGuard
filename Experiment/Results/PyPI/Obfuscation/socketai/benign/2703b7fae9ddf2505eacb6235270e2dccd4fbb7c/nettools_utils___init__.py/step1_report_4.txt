  "purpose": "Unknown - the code does not have an explicit purpose stated or evident from its content.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are not explicitly present; the code does not read from external inputs or data streams.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data could cause harm; no network calls, file writes, or system modifications detected.",
  "flows": "No identifiable data flows from sources to sinks; the code appears isolated with no external data interaction.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated segments, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The provided code fragment is either empty or contains only minimal, non-malicious constructs. No external inputs, no data flows, and no suspicious patterns are present. Absence of code logic makes it impossible to identify malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code appears benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security threats. The lack of content limits confidence, but no concerns are evident.",
