  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script or package component, but without the actual code snippet provided, the purpose cannot be definitively identified.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not specified in the provided code. Typically, sources would include user input, environment variables, file reads, network requests, or third-party library data.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks would be places where data is used insecurely, such as executing system commands, writing sensitive data to logs, network transmissions, or database queries. None are explicitly identified without actual code.",
  "flows": "Without the code, specific source-to-sink data flows cannot be mapped. In typical analysis, flows would include untrusted input passing into eval, exec, subprocess calls, or data leakage points.",
  "anomalies": "No code provided for analysis; thus, no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious functions, or obfuscation can be identified.",
  "analysis": "No code snippet was provided to analyze. Normally, this step involves examining code structure, usage of third-party libraries, suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, and data flow. Without actual code, this cannot be performed.",
  "conclusion": "Unable to conclude malicious behavior or security risks without the code. Please provide the code snippet for a detailed review.",
