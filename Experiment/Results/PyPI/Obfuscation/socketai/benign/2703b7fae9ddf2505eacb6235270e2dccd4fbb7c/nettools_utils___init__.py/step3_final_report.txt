  "purpose": "Assess the supply chain security and potential malicious behavior of the open source dependency code.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, hardcoded strings, user inputs, configuration files, imported modules, potential eval/exec statements.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file operations, eval/exec calls, environment variable access, data storage.",
  "flows": "Input sources (env vars, user input) potentially leading to eval/exec or network transmission, possibly via dynamic code execution or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "Potential obfuscation, dynamic code execution, use of eval/exec, hardcoded secrets, unusual import patterns, minimal or no code content.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of potential obfuscation and dynamic execution, with sources like environment variables and user inputs that could lead to malicious flows if exploited. The absence of concrete code snippets limits definitive conclusions, but suspicion of obfuscation and dynamic behavior warrants cautious scoring. The scores assigned reflect low malware likelihood but moderate suspicion of concealment techniques. Benign code with standard imports and no suspicious patterns is confidently scored as low risk. Lack of code or content results in minimal scores and low confidence. Overall, the assessments are consistent with the provided descriptions, with the primary concern in Report 1 being the suspicion of obfuscation, justifying a moderate obfuscated score and low malware score, pending further code analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The overall evaluation indicates low likelihood of malicious activity across the reports, with cautious suspicion in Report 1 due to potential obfuscation. Scores are appropriately assigned, and no immediate threats are identified. Continued monitoring and deeper static/dynamic analysis are recommended, especially if further code details become available.",
