  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, defining dependencies and entry points.",
  "sources": "Static dependencies list ('boto3'), package metadata, and setup configuration.",
  "sinks": "Installation process and entry point execution; no untrusted data handling or external data sources.",
  "flows": "Dependencies and setup parameters are statically defined; no dynamic data flow or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, unused 'read()' function, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, no hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard 'setup.py' script with obfuscated variable names and an unused file-reading function. No malicious code, network activity, or data exfiltration is present. Obfuscation may be intended to conceal, but no malicious behavior is evident. The dependencies are legitimate, and the package configuration is typical. The obfuscation and unused functions are suspicious but not malicious. No security vulnerabilities or malicious actions are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, representing a typical setup script with obfuscated variable names. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, there is no evidence of malware or active security risks.",
