  "conclusion": "The code is a resource discovery CLI with obfuscation and insecure credential handling but no evidence of malicious activity or malware. The current scores are appropriate; obfuscation and insecure practices warrant caution but do not confirm malicious intent. Further review of dependencies and complete code is recommended."
