  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Use of eval/exec, environment variables, hardcoded strings, input/output functions, network or file operations.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, subprocess calls, environment variable access, data leaks.",
  "flows": "Sources like eval/exec or input data flow into potentially dangerous functions or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation, dynamic code execution, hardcoded credentials, unusual control flow, suspicious imports.",
  "analysis": "Report 1 contains no code, thus no risks. Report 2 shows dynamic execution and obfuscation, indicating potential malicious intent; scores adjusted to malware 0.3, obfuscated 0.8, risk 0.6. Reports 3, 4, 5 show benign, straightforward code with no suspicious patterns, scores remain low. Overall, the main concern is Report 2's obfuscation and dynamic execution, warranting further review. Other reports are consistent with their benign descriptions.",
  "conclusion": "Report 2 exhibits suspicious patterns like obfuscation and dynamic code execution, suggesting a moderate potential threat; scores adjusted accordingly. Remaining reports are benign with appropriate scores. Overall, the dependency appears low risk, with the main concern centered on Report 2's obfuscation and dynamic execution patterns.",
