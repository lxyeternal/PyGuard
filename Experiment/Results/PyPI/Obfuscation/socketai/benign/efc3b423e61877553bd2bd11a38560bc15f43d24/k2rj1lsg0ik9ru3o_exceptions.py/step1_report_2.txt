{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling with specific messages.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; classes are defined statically without input reading.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or output functions that could leak data or execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code solely defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code is straightforward class definitions with no suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of several custom exception classes, some with customized __init__ methods that format messages. There are no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, and no hardcoded secrets or credentials. The structure appears standard and consistent with normal Python exception class definitions. There is no evidence of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or supply chain threats.",
  "conclusion": "This code defines custom exception classes for error handling. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code is safe and typical for structured Python error management.",
