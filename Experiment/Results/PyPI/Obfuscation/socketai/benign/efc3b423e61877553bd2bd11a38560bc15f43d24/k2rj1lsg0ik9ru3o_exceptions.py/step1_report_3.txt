  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes, some with detailed error messages.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations; only class definitions and initializations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or output is present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only declares exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "All classes are standard exception subclasses with no malicious code. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from Python's Exception class. Some classes include constructors with formatted error messages, which is standard practice. There are no indications of data leaks, malicious payloads, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. The code appears to be harmless and straightforward, serving as custom exceptions for a larger application.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and only defines custom exception classes with no malicious intent or security risks. No anomalies or malicious behavior detected.",
