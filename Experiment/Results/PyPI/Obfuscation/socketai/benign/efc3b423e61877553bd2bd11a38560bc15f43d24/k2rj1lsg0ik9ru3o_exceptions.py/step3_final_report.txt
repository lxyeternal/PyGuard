{
  "purpose": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes, some with specific message formatting, serving as error handling constructs within a larger application.",
  "sources": "The class definitions themselves; no external input, data reading, or data flow observed.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external communication points; the code only declares exception classes without data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code consists solely of class declarations with no runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Some class names appear obfuscated or nonsensical, which could be suspicious but are not inherently malicious. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of custom exception class definitions, some with formatted messages. No input/output, network activity, or payloads are present. The obfuscated class names in one instance are notable but do not indicate malicious intent without further context. The absence of dynamic code, data leaks, or malicious patterns suggests benign intent. The obfuscation score could be mildly elevated due to class name obfuscation, but overall, the code remains safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, consisting solely of exception class definitions with no malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscated class names are suspicious but not indicative of malicious activity. The overall security risk is minimal, and malware likelihood is effectively zero.",
