  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes, some with specific initialization messages.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and initializers; no input or data reading points.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs involving untrusted data or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; primarily class and exception declarations.",
  "anomalies": "All classes are simple, with no hidden or obfuscated code. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code contains multiple custom exception classes inheriting from Exception, with some including message formatting in their initializers. The classes appear to be straightforward and standard, serving to define specific error types. No external data input, network communication, or suspicious code constructs are present. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or sabotage mechanisms. The code does not include any obfuscation or complex logic that could hide malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely defines several custom exception classes with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a benign part of a larger codebase, serving as error types.",
