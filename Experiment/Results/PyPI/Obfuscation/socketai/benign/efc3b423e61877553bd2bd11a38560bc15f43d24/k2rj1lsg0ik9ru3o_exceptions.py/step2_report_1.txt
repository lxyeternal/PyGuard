  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Findings:** The code is just class definitions for custom exceptions, some with specific message formatting. No data input, output, or external communication. No obfuscation or malicious behavior.  \n- **Assessment:** Completely benign, straightforward exception class definitions. No issues, malware, or security risks.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. These are appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1—standard exception classes with some message formatting. No external data or malicious activity.  \n- **Assessment:** Also benign, standard code for error handling.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Findings:** Same pattern—simple exception classes with no malicious intent.  \n- **Assessment:** No issues; code is harmless.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Findings:** Exception classes with obfuscated or nonsensical class names. No external data flow or malicious behavior. The obfuscation might be suspicious but could also be auto-generated or intentionally obfuscated for other reasons.  \n- **Assessment:** While obfuscated class names are unusual, there's no evidence of malicious activity—no network, no data leaks, no payloads. The obfuscation alone isn't enough to declare malware.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - **Obfuscated:** 0.7 — seems high but plausible given the naming.  \n  - **Malware:** 0 — no evidence of malicious behavior.  \n  - **SecurityRisk:** 0.1 — minor concern due to obfuscation, but not significant.  \n- **Suggestion:** The malware score should remain at 0, as there's no indication of malicious code. The obfuscated score of 0.7 is acceptable, but perhaps slightly high; a more conservative estimate might be around 0.5, but given the report's reasoning, 0.7 is justifiable.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Findings:** Exception classes with message formatting, no malicious activity. No obfuscation or suspicious behavior.  \n- **Assessment:** Benign, standard exception class definitions.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity. The code is just class definitions for exceptions, with no network, file, or payload behavior.  \n  **Estimated malware score:** **0**\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Only Report 4 shows obfuscated class names, with a score of 0.7. The others are clear and straightforward.  \n  **Estimated obfuscated score:** **0.2** (a conservative average, acknowledging some obfuscation but no malicious intent)\n\n- **Risk Score:** All reports agree that the code is benign, with no security risks.  \n  **Estimated risk score:** **0**\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- The current scores in the reports are consistent with the analysis.  \n- The malware scores should remain at 0 across all reports.  \n- The obfuscated score in Report 4 could be slightly lowered from 0.7 to around 0.5 if desired, but 0.7 is acceptable given the context.  \n- Overall, no significant security concerns are present in this code snippet.\n\n**In conclusion:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** ~0.2–0.5 (depending on interpretation)  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is a benign set of exception class definitions with minimal security implications.",
