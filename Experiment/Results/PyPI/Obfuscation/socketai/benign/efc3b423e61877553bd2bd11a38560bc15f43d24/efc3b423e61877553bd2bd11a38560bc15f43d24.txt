      "obfuscated": 0.3,
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with obfuscation and a potential security concern due to exec() on an external file. No malware detected. The main risk is if 'version.py' is compromised, malicious code could execute. Scores should reflect low malware risk but acknowledge the exec() pattern as a moderate security concern."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code with obfuscated identifiers. No malicious activity, external communication, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The high obfuscation score is justified, but the overall security risk remains very low. The malware score is zero, aligning with the absence of malicious behavior. The data handling appears safe, and the code does not pose a security threat based on this fragment."

The obfuscated class names are suspicious but not indicative of malicious activity. The overall security risk is minimal, and malware likelihood is effectively zero."

The primary concern is obfuscation, which could be for intellectual property or concealment. Overall, the code's malicious potential is very low."

The high obfuscation scores warrant further review of the imported modules' contents, but based solely on this fragment, the security risk is minimal."

The malware score is set to 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2). The obfuscation warrants cautious review but is likely stylistic or protective rather than malicious."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign regex utility module with proper validation and escaping. No signs of malware or malicious intent are present. The obfuscation is superficial and does not indicate malicious concealment. The security risk is low, primarily related to potential regex injection if inputs are untrusted outside this scope, but within this code, measures are in place to mitigate this."

The high obfuscation is likely for code concealment or protection, not malicious intent. Overall, the security assessment indicates a low risk with no malicious activity detected."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The primary security concern is the unsafe deserialization of untrusted data via jsonpickle.decode(), which can lead to remote code execution. No evidence of malware or obfuscation is present. The risk scores should be adjusted to reflect the high severity of this vulnerability, with malware risk near 0.8 and overall security risk around 0.8. It is recommended to avoid using jsonpickle for untrusted data or implement strict validation to mitigate this risk."
