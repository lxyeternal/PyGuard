  "purpose": "Classes for policy management, validation, and parsing, with validation routines and property handling.",
  "sources": "Class constructors, __init__ methods, class methods parsing JSON, attribute setters.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network connections, or file I/O observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from JSON parsing and constructor arguments into class attributes, with validation and property methods managing data integrity.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and class names, warnings about deprecated 'rules' argument, complex copying and validation routines.",
  "analysis": "The code defines policy-related classes with validation, parsing, and dynamic attribute management. Obfuscated identifiers suggest internal styling or code obfuscation but do not indicate malicious intent. No external I/O, network activity, or malicious modifications are present. Validation routines and property methods are standard for policy frameworks. The obfuscation level is moderate, justified by the naming conventions, but does not imply malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, complex policy management framework with obfuscated naming. No signs of malware, sabotage, or supply chain compromise are evident. The malware score is set to 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2). The obfuscation warrants cautious review but is likely stylistic or protective rather than malicious.",
