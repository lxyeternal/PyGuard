  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from an external file ('version.py') and package description from 'README.md'.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data outputs or system commands executed with untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Reads version.py content into a dictionary, then uses this data during setup without executing untrusted code at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'exec' to execute contents of 'version.py' could be malicious if the file is tampered with, but this is a common pattern for version management. The variable names are obfuscated but do not contain malicious patterns. No suspicious network activity or file manipulation is present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools and reads external files for version info and README content. The use of 'exec' to run 'version.py' is potentially risky if the file is compromised, but this pattern is standard in Python packaging. The rest of the code simply configures package metadata and dependencies, with obfuscated variable names but no malicious logic or network activity. No malicious behavior, malware, or suspicious activities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script with obfuscated variable names and 'exec' usage for version loading. Although 'exec' can be risky if the version file is tampered, this pattern is typical and not inherently malicious. No evidence of malicious intent or malware detected.",
