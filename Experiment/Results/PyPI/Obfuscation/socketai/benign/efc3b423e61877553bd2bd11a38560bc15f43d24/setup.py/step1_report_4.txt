{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package, defining package metadata, dependencies, and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading 'version.py' to execute its content; reading 'README.md' for long description; no other data input sources identified.",
  "sinks": "The code does not appear to process or output untrusted data; it primarily calls setup functions and reads files.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the script executes static files and sets package info.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on contents of 'version.py' is potentially risky if 'version.py' is malicious or tampered, as it executes arbitrary code. Filenames are obfuscated with non-descriptive variable names, but no malicious behavior directly apparent.",
  "analysis": "The script loads package version information via exec(), which could execute malicious code if 'version.py' is compromised. Other parts are standard for Python package setup, with no network calls, obfuscated or malicious code, or suspicious logic. Variable naming is obfuscated but appears to be placeholder or generated names, not inherently malicious. Overall, the setup process is typical, but the use of exec() warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script for a Python package, with the notable exception of executing 'version.py' via exec(), which could pose security risks if the file is malicious or altered. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or data leaks in this code segment, but the exec() pattern should be reviewed in the context of the file contents.",
