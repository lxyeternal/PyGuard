  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with obfuscation and a potential security concern due to exec() on an external file. No malware detected. The main risk is if 'version.py' is compromised, malicious code could execute. Scores should reflect low malware risk but acknowledge the exec() pattern as a moderate security concern."
