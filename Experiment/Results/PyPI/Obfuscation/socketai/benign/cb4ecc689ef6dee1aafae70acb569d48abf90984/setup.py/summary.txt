  "conclusion": "The script is a heavily obfuscated or malformed setup configuration with no direct evidence of malware or malicious intent. The high obfuscation warrants caution and further manual review, but current evidence does not justify a malware classification. The risk is moderate, primarily due to obfuscation and potential misconfiguration."
