{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to configure a Python package using setuptools, reading a README file and specifying package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; variables assigned with obfuscated or nonsensical names; setup() called with package info and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or network operations; no malicious code execution observed.",
  "flows": "Input from 'README.md' flows into the 'long_description' parameter; obfuscated variables feed into setup() arguments; no external data or untrusted sources influence the flow.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; malformed or nonsensical parameter names (e.g., 'BcbHzVGcUQgWCxsjWJkwYJbBArLpxnzV'); dependencies assigned to variables but not passed as standard arguments; inconsistent parameter usage.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard setup procedure but is heavily obfuscated with nonsensical variable names and malformed parameters, which could be an attempt to hide malicious intent or simply poor obfuscation. No evidence of malicious behavior, network activity, or data leakage was found. The obfuscation and misconfiguration raise suspicion but do not confirm malicious activity. The malware score remains at 0, the obfuscated score is high (~0.75-0.8), and the overall security risk is moderate (~0.3), reflecting caution due to obfuscation but no active threats.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a heavily obfuscated or malformed setup configuration with no direct evidence of malware or malicious intent. The high obfuscation warrants caution and further manual review, but current evidence does not justify a malware classification. The risk is moderate, primarily due to obfuscation and potential misconfiguration.",
