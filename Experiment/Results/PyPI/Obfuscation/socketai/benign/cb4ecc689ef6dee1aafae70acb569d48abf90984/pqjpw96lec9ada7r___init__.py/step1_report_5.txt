  "purpose": "Import a specific class from a local module named 'stoi' and define a version string variable.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .stoi and the assignment of a string to the variable tilfajrGJDfLxrKbcyvdgAjscFikcPPo.",
  "sinks": "The import statement loads code from a local module; the string assignment is benign.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the import loads code from a local module, and the string assignment is static.",
  "anomalies": "The imported class name 'QMxqECdiskkNIuVYhRVwnVSdDwcftUoW' appears as a random string, which could suggest obfuscation or code hiding. The variable name 'tilfajrGJDfLxrKbcyvdgAjscFikcPPo' is a nonsensical, obfuscated-looking string. These patterns are unusual for standard code and may indicate obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard import from a local module and assigns a version string. The class name and variable name are nonsensical and appear obfuscated, which could be a sign of hiding malicious intent or obfuscation. No dynamic execution, network activity, or external data handling is present. The import is from a local relative module, which is typical but combined with obfuscated identifiers, warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal and does not explicitly perform malicious actions, but the use of obfuscated identifiers suggests potential concealment. The import from a local module is not suspicious by itself, but the naming conventions are unusual and could indicate obfuscation or malicious hiding. Overall, low confidence in malicious intent based solely on this snippet, but obfuscation warrants further review.",
