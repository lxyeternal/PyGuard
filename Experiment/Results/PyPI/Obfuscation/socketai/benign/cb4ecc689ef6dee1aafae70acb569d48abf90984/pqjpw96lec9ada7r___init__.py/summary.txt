  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with obfuscation being the primary concern. The malware score should remain at 0 or very low (0.1), the obfuscation score high (around 0.7-0.8), and the overall security risk low (around 0.2). The assessments are consistent and justified; no significant revision is necessary. Further review of the larger package context is recommended if part of a broader system."
