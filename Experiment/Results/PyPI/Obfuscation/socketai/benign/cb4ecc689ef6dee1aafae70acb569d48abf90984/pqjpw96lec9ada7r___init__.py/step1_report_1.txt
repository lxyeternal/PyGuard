  "purpose": "Import a class from a relative module and assign a version string to a variable.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a relative module; assignment of a string to a variable.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no external data, user input, or untrusted sources are used.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; only static imports and variable assignment are present.",
  "anomalies": "The imported symbol has a seemingly random, obfuscated name; the module name 'stoi' and class name 'QMxqECdiskkNIuVYhRVwnVSdDwcftUoW' suggest possible obfuscation or malicious intent, but no malicious behavior is evident in this minimal snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a relative module with a non-descriptive name, which could be a sign of obfuscation. The version string appears normal. No data flows from untrusted sources, and there are no apparent sinks for malicious actions. The code is minimal, only importing and assigning a string, with no active logic or external communication. The unusual naming could be suspicious but might also be benign or boilerplate code.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet appears to be a simple import and variable assignment with obfuscated naming. There is no direct evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this isolated code. However, the obfuscated class name warrants caution if the overall package context is unknown.",
