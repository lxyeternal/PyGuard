  "purpose": "Import a class or function from a relative module and define a version string",
  "sources": "Import statement from .stoi module, assignment of version string",
  "sinks": "None directly, no untrusted data or outputs",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "The imported name 'QMxqECdiskkNIuVYhRVwnVSdDwcftUoW' appears as a seemingly random or obfuscated identifier, which could indicate obfuscation or malicious intent. The string assigned to 'tilfajrGJDfLxrKbcyvdgAjscFikcPPo' is a version number but is not suspicious on its own.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a single item from a relative module named 'stoi', with a seemingly obfuscated name. The variable 'tilfajrGJDfLxrKbcyvdgAjscFikcPPo' stores a version string. There are no obvious security issues such as code injection, hardcoded credentials, or malicious commands. The obfuscated import name raises suspicion of intentional obfuscation, which is sometimes used to hide malicious intent, but it could also be a non-malicious obfuscation or auto-generated name.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal, involving a relative import with an obfuscated identifier and a version string. While the obfuscated name may indicate an attempt to hide intent, there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior. No security risks or malware are evident in this snippet.",
