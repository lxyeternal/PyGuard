  "purpose": "Import a class from a relative module and assign a version string to a variable.",
  "sources": "Relative import from .stoi module, reading class or symbol QMxqECdiskkNIuVYhRVwnVSdDwcftUoW; assignment of version string to variable tilfajrGJDfLxrKbcyvdgAjscFikcPPo.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; import and assignment are static, with no data flow or external communication.",
  "flows": "Import statement loads class symbol; variable assignment stores version string; no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names, which could be used to conceal malicious intent; minimal code activity; no active malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a relative import of a symbol with an obfuscated name from a local module, and assigns a version string to an obfuscated variable. The import and assignment are minimal and do not involve external data or network activity. The obfuscation raises suspicion but is not evidence of malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0 or 0.1, risk 0.2, obfuscated 0.7-0.8) are consistent with the analysis. No active malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or network communication, is evident. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not confirm malicious activity in this isolated snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with obfuscation being the primary concern. The malware score should remain at 0 or very low (0.1), the obfuscation score high (around 0.7-0.8), and the overall security risk low (around 0.2). The assessments are consistent and justified; no significant revision is necessary. Further review of the larger package context is recommended if part of a broader system.",
