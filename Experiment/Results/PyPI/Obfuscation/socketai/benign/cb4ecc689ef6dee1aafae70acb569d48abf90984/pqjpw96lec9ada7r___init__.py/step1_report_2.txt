  "purpose": "Import a specific class or function from a local module named 'stoi'.",
  "sources": "Import statement: from .stoi import QMxqECdiskkNIuVYhRVwnVSdDwcftUoW",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data flows are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; only an import statement and a string assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual identifiers such as 'QMxqECdiskkNIuVYhRVwnVSdDwcftUoW' and variable name 'tilfajrGJDfLxrKbcyvdgAjscFikcPPo' suggest obfuscated or intentionally obscure naming. The import source is a relative import, which is normal in package code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward import from a local module and assigns a version string to a variable. No user input, external data, or network activity is involved. The obfuscated names could be intentional to hide purpose but do not inherently indicate malicious behavior. There are no visible suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, code execution, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple, involving a local import and a string assignment with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks based on this fragment alone.",
