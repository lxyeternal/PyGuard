{
  "purpose": "Import a specific class or function from a local module and define a version string",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module 'stoi', and a string assignment",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present; no data leak or external communication",
  "flows": "Import statement imports code from local module; string assignment is static and untrusted data flow is absent",
  "anomalies": "Importing from a relative module with a seemingly random or obfuscated name; no other suspicious activity",
  "analysis": "The code imports a symbol 'QMxqECdiskkNIuVYhRVwnVSdDwcftUoW' from a local module '.stoi', which could be obfuscated or auto-generated, indicating potential concealment. The version string assignment is static and not inherently malicious. No external network, data handling, or obfuscation techniques are present. The import source may be suspicious if the module or symbol is obfuscated or unknown, but based solely on this snippet, there is no clear malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal, performing a standard import and defining a version string. The import's source and symbol name appear obfuscated, which could be suspicious, but no direct malicious behavior or security risks are evident. Overall, low suspicion based on this fragment.",
