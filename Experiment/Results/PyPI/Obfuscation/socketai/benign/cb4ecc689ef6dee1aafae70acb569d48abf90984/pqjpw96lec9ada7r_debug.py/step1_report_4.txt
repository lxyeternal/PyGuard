{
  "purpose": "The code loads audio files and computes the Short-Time Objective Intelligibility (STOI) score between them, likely for audio quality or speech intelligibility assessment.",
  "sources": "Reading audio files 'bugged_data/enhanced_9.wav' and 'bugged_data/reference_9.wav' using torchaudio.load",
  "sinks": "Calling the PytorchSTOI instance with loaded audio data to compute a metric, potentially exposing data or being used in evaluation",
  "flows": "Audio files are loaded (sources) and their data are passed into the PytorchSTOI object (sink), which computes and returns a score",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, unusual code, or suspicious behavior; variable names appear obfuscated but are consistent with data flow",
  "analysis": "The code loads two audio files from a directory named 'bugged_data', processes them with a third-party metric class PytorchSTOI, and prints the result. No obfuscated code patterns or malicious network activity are evident. Usage of standard libraries and a legitimate metric calculation suggest normal operation. The obfuscation of variable names may be suspicious but is not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets or system modifications are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to perform a legitimate audio quality comparison task. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. Variable obfuscation does not indicate malicious intent but could be intentional obfuscation. Overall, the code is safe.",
