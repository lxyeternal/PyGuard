      "conclusion": "The script is a heavily obfuscated or malformed setup configuration with no direct evidence of malware or malicious intent. The high obfuscation warrants caution and further manual review, but current evidence does not justify a malware classification. The risk is moderate, primarily due to obfuscation and potential misconfiguration."

      "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with obfuscation being the primary concern. The malware score should remain at 0 or very low (0.1), the obfuscation score high (around 0.7-0.8), and the overall security risk low (around 0.2). The assessments are consistent and justified; no significant revision is necessary. Further review of the larger package context is recommended if part of a broader system."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, complex audio processing module with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain compromise, or malicious sabotage. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not justify higher malware or security risk scores. Static analysis indicates a benign purpose focused on spectral and voice activity analysis."

The malware score is set to 0, and the security risk score remains low at 0.2, reflecting concerns about obfuscation but not actual threat."
