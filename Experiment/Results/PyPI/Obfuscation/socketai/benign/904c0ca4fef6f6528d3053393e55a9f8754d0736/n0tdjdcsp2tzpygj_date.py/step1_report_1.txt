  "purpose": "Generate a list of datetime objects between two dates with a specified step size, optionally including the end date.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: ofkLWVgbcZgZpqLFLfbpbOIPRaIeDGrW, egOJrqsHrXUWJPLBySlpMDdRwPVpHqJx, and step.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data output or external communication present.",
  "flows": "Input date parameters are used to control the loop; no data flows outside the function.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names, which appear intentionally obfuscated; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The function takes start and end datetime objects, along with a step timedelta. It checks that start is before end and that the step is greater than one day. It iteratively adds the step to the current datetime, appending each value to a list until reaching or exceeding the end date. It optionally excludes the end date if 'inclusive' is False. Variable names are obfuscated, but the logic is straightforward, with no external calls or suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a standard date range generator with input validation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious side effects. The obfuscated variable names do not indicate malicious intent but may hinder readability.",
