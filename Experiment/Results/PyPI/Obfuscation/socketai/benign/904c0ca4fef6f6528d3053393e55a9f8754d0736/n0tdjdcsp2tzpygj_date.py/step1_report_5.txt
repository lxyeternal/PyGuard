  "purpose": "Generate a list of datetime points between a start and end date, incremented by a specified step, optionally including the end date.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'ofkLWVgbcZgZpqLFLfbpbOIPRaIeDGrW', 'egOJrqsHrXUWJPLBySlpMDdRwPVpHqJx', 'step', 'inclusive'.",
  "sinks": "The list 'mPsCZntXOazjitEwOmrpozOroHaaQyJJ' containing datetime objects; no untrusted data used externally.",
  "flows": "The function checks input validity, then iteratively appends the current date to the list, incrementing by 'step' until exceeding the end date.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are obfuscated, but no signs of malicious obfuscation or hidden code. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "The code validates start and end dates, and the step size, then creates a list of datetime points from start to end. It includes or excludes the end date based on the 'inclusive' flag. Variable names are intentionally obfuscated but do not indicate malicious intent. The logic appears straightforward and standard for date range generation. No external data sources, network calls, or file operations are present. The code is purely computational with no evidence of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a date range generator with obfuscated variable names but otherwise standard logic. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It performs a benign task with no signs of malware or security risks.",
