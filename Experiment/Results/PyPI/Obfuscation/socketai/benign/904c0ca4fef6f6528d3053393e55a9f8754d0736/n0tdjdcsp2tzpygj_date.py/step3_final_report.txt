  "purpose": "Generate a list of datetime objects between a start and end date with a specified step, optionally including the end date.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: start date, end date, step timedelta, and optional 'inclusive' flag.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or data leaks; purely in-memory list generation.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are validated, then a loop increments the current date by 'step' until reaching the end date, appending each date to the list.",
  "anomalies": "Variable and function names are heavily obfuscated, which could hinder readability but does not indicate malicious intent. Validation enforces 'step' > 1 day, which may be unnecessarily restrictive.",
  "analysis": "The code performs input validation to ensure start < end and step > 1 day, then iteratively appends dates from start to end, respecting the 'inclusive' flag. No external communication, code injection, or malicious behavior is present. Obfuscation is likely for privacy or minimization, not malicious purposes. The logic is straightforward and standard for date range generation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function for generating date sequences. No malicious activity or security vulnerabilities are detected. Obfuscation is present but not indicative of malicious intent. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score around 0.7, and security risk score approximately 0.1 are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
