  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility function, but the specific intent is unclear without further context.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables, function parameters, or external modules, but no explicit input sources like files, network, or user input are clearly shown.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or system commands, but no such operations are explicitly evident in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "No clear source-to-sink data flows are observable in the provided code, as the code appears to perform computations without external data interaction.",
  "anomalies": "There are no obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual language features. The code structure seems straightforward, but the lack of context limits certainty.",
  "analysis": "The code does not show any suspicious imports, functions, or code patterns. It neither executes dynamic code nor accesses sensitive information. There are no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms within the visible code. The absence of external data interactions or network activity reduces suspicion. Without additional context or external code, no malicious intent or security risks are detectable.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code fragment, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with no indicators of malware or security threats. However, limited context means some potential risks cannot be fully ruled out if external factors or code outside this snippet are considered.",
