{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly clear due to lack of comments or documentation, but it appears to involve importing modules, potentially setting up environment variables, or performing some initialization routines.",
  "sources": "Code reads input or data from environment variables, imported modules, or possibly user input (though not explicitly shown).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, system commands, file operations, or data transmissions if present later in the code (not visible here).",
  "flows": "Data likely flows from environment variables or user inputs through processing functions to output or network transmission points (not explicitly shown in provided code).",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious function calls are evident. The code snippet is minimal and lacks distinctive malicious indicators.",
  "analysis": "The provided code fragment is extremely limited, containing only import statements without further logic. There are no apparent data flows, data leaks, or malicious operations visible. The absence of detailed code prevents detection of hidden malicious activities. Given the minimal content, no suspicious behaviors, anomalies, or malware signatures are evident. Without additional code, it's impossible to assess the full context or potential malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on the provided snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. The code appears benign, but the limited scope prevents a definitive assessment. Additional code context is needed for a thorough review.",
