  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific errors related to directives.",
  "sources": "import statement for habits_txt.directives; no other input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is used to affect system security or leak data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only defines classes without data manipulation or execution paths.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class names and variable names without meaningful identifiers; no apparent malicious code or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module, then defines two custom exception classes. The first class extends Exception without additional logic, simply storing a message. The second class also extends Exception, formats a message with line number info from a directive object, and overrides __str__ to return that message. There are no function calls, no dynamic code execution, and no handling of untrusted input beyond class initializations. The naming appears intentionally obscure but does not indicate malicious intent. No suspicious behaviors or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely defines custom exception classes with obfuscated names. It does not perform any malicious actions, data leaks, or security breaches. The lack of dynamic behavior or external data processing suggests a low risk level.",
