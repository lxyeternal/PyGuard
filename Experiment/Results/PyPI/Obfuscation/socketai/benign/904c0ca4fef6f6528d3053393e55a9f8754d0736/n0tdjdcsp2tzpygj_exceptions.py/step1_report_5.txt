  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error conditions, possibly related to directives processing.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'habits_txt.directives' module; exception initializers receiving message strings and directive objects.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data processing or external system interactions present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into exception initializers via message and directive parameters, but no dangerous data handling occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Class names are non-descriptive and obfuscated; the exception class names are obscure and could be used to hide malicious intent. The use of complex, seemingly meaningless class names suggests possible obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module and defines two exception classes with unusual, obfuscated names. The first class stores a message; the second class constructs a formatted message incorporating a line number from a directive object. There is no evidence of data leakage, network activity, or malicious behavior. The naming convention raises suspicion of obfuscation, but no active malicious behavior is evident. No code execution, external calls, or data processing that could be exploited is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily defines custom exceptions with obfuscated names. No malicious activity or security risks are apparent. The unusual class names may indicate obfuscation, but there is no malicious behavior or security threat identified.",
