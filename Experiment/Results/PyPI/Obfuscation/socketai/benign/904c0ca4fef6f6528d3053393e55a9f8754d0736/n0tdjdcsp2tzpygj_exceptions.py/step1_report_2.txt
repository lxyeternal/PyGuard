  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes, potentially for handling specific error conditions related to directives processing.",
  "sources": "Import statement: habits_txt.directives as directives; Exception instantiations and class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data handling or output; no sinks identified that could lead to data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code primarily defines classes and imports.",
  "anomalies": "Class names are nonsensical and obfuscated; no meaningful variable names; no real processing logic; unconventional naming may suggest obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module named 'habits_txt.directives' and defines two custom exception classes with obfuscated class names. One exception class stores a message, the other constructs a message with line number details from a directive object. The classes do not perform any operations beyond storing or formatting messages. There is no indication of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads. The unusual class names and lack of functional code could be suspicious but may also be harmless obfuscation or placeholder code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a minimal setup for custom exceptions with obfuscated class names, possibly for internal use or obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this fragment. The code's unusual naming warrants caution but does not indicate malware or malicious intent.",
