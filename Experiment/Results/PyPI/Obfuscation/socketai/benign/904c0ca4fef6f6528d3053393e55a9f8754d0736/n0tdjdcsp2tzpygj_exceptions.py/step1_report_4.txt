{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes, one of which includes detailed error messaging related to directives.",
  "sources": "The code imports a module 'habits_txt.directives' and uses it to type hint in an exception class.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling evident; no I/O or data transmission points.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; code primarily defines classes and imports.",
  "anomalies": "Class names are obfuscated or nonsensical, suggesting possible obfuscation or code reuse without clarity; no secrets or hardcoded credentials; no malicious code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module, then defines two custom exceptions with unusual class names that do not indicate malicious intent. The second exception class utilizes a message that incorporates line number information from a directive object, which suggests detailed error reporting. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is present. The obfuscated class names might be intentional to conceal purpose or a result of code obfuscation, but this alone does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code is benign, serving as structured exception handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be harmless, primarily defining custom exceptions with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscated class names could indicate intentional obfuscation but do not imply malicious intent. No security concerns are apparent based on the provided snippet.",
