  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific errors, possibly related to directives processing.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'habits_txt.directives', usage of 'directives.vKpDfuLdtsJOjppEaOCDgBlvfLtdKCGB' in the constructor.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no external data output or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; exception classes do not handle external input or perform data operations.",
  "anomalies": "Class and variable names are obfuscated or nonsensical, which could be a sign of obfuscation. The code only defines classes and constructors without executing any logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module and defines two exception classes with obfuscated names. One class has a simple message attribute, while the other constructs a message involving a directive object, specifically accessing 'lineno'. There are no functions, data processing, network calls, or other behaviors that could be malicious. The use of obfuscated class names is suspicious, but without further context, it does not necessarily imply malicious intent. The code is minimal and appears to serve as part of a larger system for error handling, with no evident malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists of obfuscated class definitions for custom exceptions, with no active malicious behavior or security threats detected. The obfuscated naming could be a security by obscurity measure or an indication of code concealment, but based solely on this snippet, no malicious intent is apparent.",
