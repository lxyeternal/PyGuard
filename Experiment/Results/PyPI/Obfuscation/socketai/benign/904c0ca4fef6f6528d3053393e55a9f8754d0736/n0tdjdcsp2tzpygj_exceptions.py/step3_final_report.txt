{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes with obfuscated names, likely for error handling in a larger system.",
  "sources": "Import of 'habits_txt.directives' used for type hints and message formatting.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data or network interactions present.",
  "flows": "Exception classes store or format messages; no data flows beyond class initialization.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class names and nonsensical identifiers; minimal code structure; no active logic.",
  "analysis": "The code only defines two exception classes with obfuscated names, with no functions, data processing, or external interactions. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not indicate malicious intent. Malware and security risk scores are low, consistent with the benign nature. Obfuscation score is high due to class names, but overall, the code appears to be a minimal error handling setup without malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a minimal, obfuscated error handling module. No malicious activity or security threats are evident. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
