  "purpose": "Define classes for handling different types of user directives related to habits, such as tracking, untracking, and recording habits.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and defines classes with no external data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data output functions; the code only defines classes and methods without I/O operations or data transmission.",
  "flows": "Class methods and constructors initialize objects with parameters; no untrusted data flow or external influence identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected. No evidence of obfuscation or malicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class definitions for managing habit directives with standard Python features. No external data is read, nor are there network or system operations. The code appears to be a straightforward data structure implementation without any evident malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign data modeling module for habit tracking directives. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks are present based on this code snippet.",
