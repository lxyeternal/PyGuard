  "purpose": "Define data structures for habit tracking directives including tracking, untracking, and recording habits.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; static class definitions and imports from local modules.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows to external systems or outputs.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code only defines classes without data flow execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions with standard Python practices.",
  "analysis": "The code implements simple data classes for habit directives, utilizing Enums, inheritance, and standard methods. It does not process external data, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions suggest it is benign and free of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured implementation of data models for habit directives, with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
