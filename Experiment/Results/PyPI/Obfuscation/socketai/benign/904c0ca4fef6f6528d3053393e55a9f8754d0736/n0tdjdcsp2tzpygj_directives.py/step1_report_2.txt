{
  "purpose": "Defines classes for managing habit tracking directives, including tracking, untracking, and recording habits.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'habits_txt.defaults' and 'habits_txt.models'; data input from class constructors and method parameters.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data leading to data leaks or execution flows that could be exploited.",
  "flows": "Input data (dates, habit names, metadata, values) flows into class attributes; no dangerous flow patterns observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Usage of string formatting in __repr__ is safe; no dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data classes for different directive types with clear and straightforward initialization and comparison methods. It references external defaults and models but does not execute or manipulate untrusted input in an unsafe manner. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, file manipulation, or code injection. The structure is standard for data modeling, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical data structure implementation for managing habit tracking directives, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
