{
  "purpose": "Define classes and enumerations for managing habit tracking directives, including tracking, untracking, and recording habits.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include the parameters passed to class constructors such as date, habit_name, lineno, metadata, frequency, is_measurable, and value.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are the string representations (__repr__ methods) and comparisons (__eq__ methods), which do not involve external systems or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor inputs into class attributes and then into string representations; no external data or user input handling is observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or unsafe operations are present. The code relies on external modules for defaults and models but does not interact with external systems or execute untrusted code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several classes with initialization and comparison methods, primarily for managing habit tracking directives. There are no external data sources beyond parameters, and no sinks such as network, file, or system commands are used. The use of Enums and class inheritance appears standard. The __repr__ and __eq__ methods are straightforward and do not involve any suspicious operations. No signs of malicious code, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation of data classes for habit tracking with no malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any external communication, data handling beyond local memory, or contain suspicious constructs.",
