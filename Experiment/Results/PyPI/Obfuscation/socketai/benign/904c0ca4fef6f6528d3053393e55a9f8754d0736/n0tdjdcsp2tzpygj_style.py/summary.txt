  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for styling and formatting habit tracking data. Despite heavy obfuscation, there is no evidence of malicious intent or activity. The assigned malware score of 0.0 and low security risk score are appropriate. The obfuscation score should be around 0.75, reflecting the significant obfuscation, and the overall risk remains minimal."
