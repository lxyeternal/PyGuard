  "purpose": "Utility functions for styling and formatting habit data for display purposes.",
  "sources": "Input strings, datetime objects, model instances, and external configuration.",
  "sinks": "Styled output via click.style and string concatenation for display.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters and models into styled strings and formatted outputs.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of enum member names and variable identifiers; reliance on external configs; no secrets or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides styling and formatting utilities for habit data, with obfuscated enum members and variable names likely for stylistic or concealment reasons. No network activity, code injection, or malicious behavior is evident. The obfuscation is significant but appears to be stylistic rather than malicious. The functions operate solely on data formatting and presentation, with no dangerous sinks or suspicious data flows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for styling and formatting habit tracking data. Despite heavy obfuscation, there is no evidence of malicious intent or activity. The assigned malware score of 0.0 and low security risk score are appropriate. The obfuscation score should be around 0.75, reflecting the significant obfuscation, and the overall risk remains minimal.",
