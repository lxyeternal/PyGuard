  "conclusion": "The code is benign in isolation but exhibits obfuscation techniques and an unusual import that could be used to hide malicious code elsewhere. The low malware score aligns with the lack of active malicious behavior, but further review of the full codebase is recommended to confirm whether the obfuscation and import anomalies are benign or malicious."
