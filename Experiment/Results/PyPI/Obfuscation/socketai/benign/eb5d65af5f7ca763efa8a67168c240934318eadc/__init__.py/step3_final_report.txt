  "purpose": "Import dependencies for time series and user data objects.",
  "sources": "Import statements from standard and local modules, including an unusual import of 'zDbTPRMjaMVHfheTDkNgutluLctvLrXA' from 'datetime'.",
  "sinks": "None; code contains only import statements, no data processing or network activity.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no executable code present.",
  "anomalies": "Import of 'zDbTPRMjaMVHfheTDkNgutluLctvLrXA' from 'datetime' which does not exist in the standard library; obfuscated class and variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with heavily obfuscated class names, suggesting possible concealment or auto-generation. The import of a non-standard attribute from 'datetime' ('zDbTPRMjaMVHfheTDkNgutluLctvLrXA') is suspicious and likely indicates obfuscation or an error. No active code, network activity, or data leakage is present. The obfuscation pattern and suspicious import warrant further review of the full codebase to determine if malicious code is hidden elsewhere. Malware scores are low (around 0.15-0.2), consistent with no active malicious behavior, while obfuscation scores are high (around 0.75), reflecting the obfuscated naming. Security risk remains low (around 0.2), but the suspicious import should be verified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign in isolation but exhibits obfuscation techniques and an unusual import that could be used to hide malicious code elsewhere. The low malware score aligns with the lack of active malicious behavior, but further review of the full codebase is recommended to confirm whether the obfuscation and import anomalies are benign or malicious.",
