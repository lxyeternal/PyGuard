  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation and complex SSL certificate management, which are red flags but not definitive proof of malicious activity. The overall risk is moderate, primarily due to obfuscation and SSL handling practices. No concrete malicious behavior was observed, but further environment-specific review and runtime analysis are recommended before deployment in sensitive contexts."
