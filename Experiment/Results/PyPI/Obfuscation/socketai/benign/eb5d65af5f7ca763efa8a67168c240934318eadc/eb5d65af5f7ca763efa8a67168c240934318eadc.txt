      "obfuscated": 0.75,
      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code is benign in isolation but exhibits obfuscation techniques and an unusual import that could be used to hide malicious code elsewhere. The low malware score aligns with the lack of active malicious behavior, but further review of the full codebase is recommended to confirm whether the obfuscation and import anomalies are benign or malicious."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, albeit obfuscated, API client with some practices—particularly SSL certificate handling—that warrant caution. There is no direct evidence of malware or sabotage, but the SSL handling pattern could be exploited for interception. The obfuscation and complex SSL management suggest a moderate security risk, primarily related to potential SSL interception rather than active malicious intent."

The overall risk is moderate, primarily due to obfuscation and SSL handling practices. No concrete malicious behavior was observed, but further environment-specific review and runtime analysis are recommended before deployment in sensitive contexts."

      "conclusion": "While the code is heavily obfuscated and complex, there is no direct evidence of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or sabotage. The obfuscation warrants caution, but static analysis alone cannot confirm malicious intent. The overall security risk is moderate, primarily due to obfuscation and network interactions, but the likelihood of malicious behavior appears low based on current evidence."

The anomalies are consistent with obfuscation or auto-generated code rather than malicious sabotage. The overall security risk is low, and malware likelihood is minimal."
