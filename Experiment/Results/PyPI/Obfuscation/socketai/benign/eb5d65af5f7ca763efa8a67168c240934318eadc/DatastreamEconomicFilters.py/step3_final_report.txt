  "purpose": "Client for Datastream's Economic Filters API, managing tokens, filters, and data retrieval with environment-specific SSL handling.",
  "sources": "Configuration files, credentials, network requests, JSON serialization, environment variables, system certificates.",
  "sinks": "Network POST requests, temporary PEM files on Windows, JSON responses, potential SSL certificate files.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (config, credentials, environment) lead to token management and SSL setup, then to network requests and JSON processing.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class/variable names, dynamic SSL certificate creation from system certs on Windows, import of non-standard datetime class, complex request/response flow.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a legitimate API client with token refresh, filter management, and data retrieval. Obfuscation is superficial but present, likely for code concealment. SSL certificate handling involves creating PEM files from system certificates on Windows, which is unusual and could be exploited for man-in-the-middle attacks. No hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads are detected. The network communication appears standard. The obfuscation and SSL handling techniques are suspicious but not definitively malicious. Scores assigned (malware ~0.2, risk ~0.4, obfuscation ~0.65) are justified based on these observations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a superficially obfuscated API client with environment-specific SSL certificate handling that could be exploited maliciously but shows no active malicious payloads or behavior. The suspicion is moderate, warranting caution but not immediate rejection.",
