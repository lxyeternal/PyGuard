  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for a Python package, reading README.md and invoking setup() with package metadata. It contains obfuscated variable names and a non-standard argument key, but no malicious code or network activity.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' into a variable; static call to setup() with package metadata",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows or external data handling observed",
  "flows": "Reading file -> setup() call with static arguments; no dynamic or external data flow",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; non-standard argument key 'esnBiDWrqYoOjqDYmIlLrSSNudTEbrFZ=' in setup()",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script with obfuscated variable names and an unusual argument key. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or malicious behavior is present. The obfuscation may be for concealment but does not imply malicious intent. The non-standard argument key is suspicious but not evidence of malicious activity. Scores reflect high obfuscation but low malware risk. Overall, the code is benign but warrants cautious review due to obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with obfuscation and a suspicious argument key. No malicious activity or security risks are evident. The obfuscation and unusual parameter merit attention but do not constitute malicious behavior.",
