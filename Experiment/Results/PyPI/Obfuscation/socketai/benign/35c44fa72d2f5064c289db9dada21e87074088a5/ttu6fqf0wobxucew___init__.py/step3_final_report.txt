{
  "purpose": "The code implements spectral graph wavelet transforms for shape analysis and node embedding, utilizing spectral methods and feature computations.",
  "sources": "Reads spectral data, variable initializations, and feature calculations from spectral graph functions and placeholder strings.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data flows to untrusted sources are evident; no network or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "Spectral data flows from spectral functions through localizations and feature computations, with no external data leaks or malicious sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names (e.g., JDKDGWngidTvujetfscNOTzAHxZLcGkt), placeholder strings, complex indexing, but no malicious code or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard spectral graph wavelet analysis, with obfuscated variable names likely for proprietary or complexity reasons. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or system manipulation are detected. The obfuscation is significant but appears to serve code concealment rather than malicious intent. The absence of network activity, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious system calls supports this conclusion.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate spectral graph wavelet implementation with high obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not indicate malware. Overall, the security risk is low, and the malware score is zero.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.65,
