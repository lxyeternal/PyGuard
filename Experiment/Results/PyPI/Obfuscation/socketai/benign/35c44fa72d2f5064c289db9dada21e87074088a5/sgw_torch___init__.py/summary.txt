  "conclusion": "The code is a complex but benign graph preprocessing utility. Obfuscation is present but appears intended to hinder readability rather than conceal malicious activity. Static analysis shows no evidence of malware or security risks. The current low malware score (0) and low security risk score (~0.2) are appropriate. The obfuscation score could be slightly increased to reflect the variable naming complexity, but overall, the code is likely safe."
