  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate spectral analysis implementation with heavy obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. The high obfuscation score reflects the nonsensical naming, but the overall security risk remains low. The malware score is set to 0, consistent with the absence of malicious actions. Further static or dynamic analysis is recommended if used in critical environments, but based on this fragment, it is benign."
