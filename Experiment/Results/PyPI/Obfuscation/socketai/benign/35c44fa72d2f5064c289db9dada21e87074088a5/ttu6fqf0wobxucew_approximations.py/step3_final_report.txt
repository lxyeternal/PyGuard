  "purpose": "Implementation of Chebyshev polynomial coefficients computation and graph filtering operations in a graph signal processing context.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as filterbank elements, Chebyshev coefficients, and signal data provided as function arguments and variables within the code.",
  "sinks": "Filtered signal output, resulting from applying Chebyshev polynomial filters to input signals, returned as ndarray.",
  "flows": "Input data (filter parameters, coefficients, signals) flow into the functions, which process them via polynomial computations, culminating in the filtered signal output.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated variable names and placeholder-like comments; no malicious code patterns or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard mathematical operations for Chebyshev polynomial coefficient calculation and graph filtering. Variable names are nonsensical, suggesting obfuscation or auto-generation, but no malicious activity such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code injection is evident. The functions and parameters align with typical graph signal processing routines. Scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, low security risk) are consistent with the described benign operations. The obfuscation score is moderate, reflecting suspicion due to naming but not malicious intent. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate implementation of mathematical routines with obfuscation as the primary concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of Chebyshev polynomial filtering in graph signal processing, with obfuscated variable names but no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The current scores are appropriate; further review of actual source code is recommended if possible.",
