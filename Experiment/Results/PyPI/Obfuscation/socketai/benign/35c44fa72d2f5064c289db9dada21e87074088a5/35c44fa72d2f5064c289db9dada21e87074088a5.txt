      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is a complex but benign graph preprocessing utility. Obfuscation is present but appears intended to hinder readability rather than conceal malicious activity. Static analysis shows no evidence of malware or security risks. The current low malware score (0) and low security risk score (~0.2) are appropriate. The obfuscation score could be slightly increased to reflect the variable naming complexity, but overall, the code is likely safe."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a heavily obfuscated, complex implementation of GNN layers with no explicit malicious activity detected. The primary concern is obfuscation and external dependency, which warrants cautious review. Further inspection of the external module sgw_torch and runtime behavior analysis are recommended before use in sensitive environments."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of spectral graph filtering implementations with obfuscated naming. There is no evidence of malware, malicious sabotage, or data exfiltration. The obfuscation raises suspicion but is not sufficient to classify the code as malicious. The overall security risk is moderate due to obfuscation but low in terms of actual malicious activity."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate spectral analysis implementation with heavy obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. The high obfuscation score reflects the nonsensical naming, but the overall security risk remains low. The malware score is set to 0, consistent with the absence of malicious actions. Further static or dynamic analysis is recommended if used in critical environments, but based on this fragment, it is benign."
