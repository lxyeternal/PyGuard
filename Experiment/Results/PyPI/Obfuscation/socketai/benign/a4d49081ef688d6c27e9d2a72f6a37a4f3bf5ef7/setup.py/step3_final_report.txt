  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging, with optional Cython and NumPy dependencies, obfuscated variable names, and fallback mechanisms.",
  "sources": "File reading (README), environment variables, command-line arguments, module imports, dependency checks, and extension source files.",
  "sinks": "No suspicious data sinks or network activity; standard package build process.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (file paths, environment, dependencies) flow into build configuration and extension compilation; no malicious data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and class names, dynamic extension source selection, fallback handling for missing dependencies, unusual method naming.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py with obfuscated identifiers, handling optional dependencies (Cython, NumPy), and conditional compilation. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code is present. Obfuscation appears stylistic or for minimization, not malicious. The code performs standard package configuration tasks, including reading README, setting up extensions, and handling missing dependencies gracefully. The obfuscation level is moderate but does not correlate with malicious intent. The logic is consistent, and no suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, obfuscated setup configuration with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The obfuscation is likely stylistic rather than malicious. The security risk is minimal, and the malware likelihood is negligible.",
