{
  "purpose": "Attempt to import obfuscated symbols from either '_fastdtw' or 'fastdtw' modules, with fallback.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules '_fastdtw' or 'fastdtw'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external effects; only import operations.",
  "flows": "Import source (module) to symbol usage; no data flow beyond import.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated, nonsensical symbol names; fallback import pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard fallback import with obfuscated identifiers, which raises suspicion but does not demonstrate malicious behavior. The obfuscated names could be auto-generated or intentionally concealed. No network activity, data exfiltration, or code execution is evident. The scores across reports appropriately reflect low malware risk and high obfuscation suspicion. Given the lack of active malicious actions, the overall risk remains low, with obfuscation being the primary concern. Further investigation of the actual modules is recommended to confirm their legitimacy.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is suspicious due to obfuscated identifiers but does not contain evidence of malicious activity. The current low malware score and moderate obfuscation score are appropriate. Vigilance is advised if additional context reveals malicious behavior.",
