  "purpose": "Attempting to import specific classes or functions from local modules, possibly part of a larger package.",

  "sinks": "No data processing or untrusted data handling observed; import statements do not act as sinks for malicious data.",
  "flows": "Import source → usage of imported components (not shown in this snippet).",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class/function names (e.g., JfOclzKNHJELYanccNCyTpnvMLdTPLnS, vqZffGnJaROOXZQtOYsaVfAOawyXcMlx) which do not reveal purpose; conditional import for fallback. The presence of seemingly random names could be a sign of obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs conditional imports from local modules, attempting to load specific classes/functions from either '_fastdtw' or 'fastdtw' modules. The class/function names appear obfuscated, which can be suspicious, but they could also be legitimate generated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity, file modifications, or data exfiltration in this fragment. The import pattern itself is standard for handling optional dependencies or module fallback. No secrets, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs are present. The obfuscated names might be used to hinder reverse engineering but are not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import pattern with obfuscated names, likely to hide internal implementation details. There is no evidence of malicious intent or malware within this snippet. The obfuscation alone does not imply malicious behavior, especially without further context.",
