{
  "purpose": "Import specific classes or functions from a local module or fallback to another local module if the first is unavailable.",
  "sources": "Import statements that read modules (_fastdtw or fastdtw) to load classes/functions.",
  "sinks": "The imported classes/functions could potentially be used later in the code to execute untrusted or malicious actions, but in this snippet, they are just imported.",
  "flows": "Import statements load modules into the namespace; potential malicious flows depend on usage of imported objects, which is not shown here.",
  "anomalies": "The imported identifiers (JfOclzKNHJELYanccNCyTpnvMLdTPLnS, vqZffGnJaROOXZQtOYsaVfAOawyXcMlx) appear obfuscated or auto-generated, which is uncommon in typical code and may indicate concealment.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import two obfuscated identifiers from either a relative module '_fastdtw' or 'fastdtw' as a fallback. The obfuscated names suggest possible code hiding or malicious intent, but the snippet itself is only an import statement with no direct malicious activity. Without further context, the code's intent cannot be definitively malicious; the obfuscation raises suspicion but isn't conclusive alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a straightforward conditional import with obfuscated identifiers, which may suggest concealment or obfuscation. There is no direct malicious behavior evident in this snippet, but the obfuscation warrants caution. Overall, the snippet alone poses low security risk but the obfuscated names should be reviewed in the context of the larger codebase.",
