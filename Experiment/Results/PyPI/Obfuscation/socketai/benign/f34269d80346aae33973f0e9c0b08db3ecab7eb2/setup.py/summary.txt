  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate build configuration script with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malware or malicious activity. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not justify high malware or security risk scores. Continued monitoring and review of the actual source files are recommended to ensure no hidden malicious logic exists."
