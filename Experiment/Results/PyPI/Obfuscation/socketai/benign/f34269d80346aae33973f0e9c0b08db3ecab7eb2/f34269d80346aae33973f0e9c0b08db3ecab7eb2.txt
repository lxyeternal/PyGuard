      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate build configuration script with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malware or malicious activity. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not justify high malware or security risk scores. Continued monitoring and review of the actual source files are recommended to ensure no hidden malicious logic exists."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of obfuscated enum definitions and imports of Windows system modules, likely auto-generated or intentionally obscured. There is no evidence of malicious activity, data exfiltration, or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation alone is not suspicious enough to warrant concern, given the lack of active behavior. Overall, the code is benign, with obfuscation as the only notable characteristic."
