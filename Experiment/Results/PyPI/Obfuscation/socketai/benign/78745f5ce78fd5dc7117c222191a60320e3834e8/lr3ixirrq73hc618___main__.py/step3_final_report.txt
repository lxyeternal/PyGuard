  "purpose": "CLI tool for license compatibility verification and license data management.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments, input files, environment variables, imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Printed messages, output files, logs, exit codes.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into argument parsing, license checks, and output functions; no network or system modification observed.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with nonsensical variable names, redundant imports, inconsistent attribute naming, complex argument handling.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a CLI wrapper for the 'flict' license management tool, with heavily obfuscated variable names and structure. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious system modifications are detected. The obfuscation appears to be stylistic or protective rather than malicious. The code relies on external modules for core logic, and no suspicious data flows or payloads are present. The high obfuscation score reflects suspicion but does not indicate malicious intent. The malware score remains at 0, consistent with the absence of malicious behaviors. The overall security risk is low, primarily elevated due to obfuscation, which warrants monitoring but does not constitute malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, if heavily obfuscated, license management CLI tool. No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious data flows is present. The obfuscation raises caution but does not imply malicious intent. The supply chain risk is low, with standard vigilance recommended.",
