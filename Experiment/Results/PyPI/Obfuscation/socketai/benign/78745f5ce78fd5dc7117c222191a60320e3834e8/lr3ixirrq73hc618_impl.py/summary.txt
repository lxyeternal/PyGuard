  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate license and project validation utility, heavily obfuscated possibly for intellectual property protection. There is no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain sabotage. The malware risk score is low, and obfuscation is justified, though it warrants cautious review. Overall, the security risk remains minimal."
