  "purpose": "This code fragment lists license identifiers and conditions, serving as metadata or licensing information rather than executable code.",
  "sources": "License declaration lines, possibly from a package manifest or project metadata",
  "sinks": "No data flows or untrusted data sources; purely static license info",
  "flows": "None, as there are no data or code flows present",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the fragment is straightforward license metadata",
  "analysis": "The fragment contains license identifiers: 'X11', 'MIT OR BSD-3-Clause', and a complex GPL condition. It does not include executable code, data processing, or system interaction. All reports correctly identify it as license metadata, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, security risk: 0, obfuscated: 0) are appropriate given the content. No suspicious patterns or anomalies are present. The data is benign and poses no threat.",
  "conclusion": "The provided data is purely licensing metadata with no security implications, malware, or obfuscation. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is consistent with the benign nature of the input.",
