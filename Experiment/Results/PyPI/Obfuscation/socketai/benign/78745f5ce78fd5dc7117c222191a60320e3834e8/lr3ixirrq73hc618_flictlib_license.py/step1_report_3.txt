{
  "purpose": "This snippet appears to be a license or dependency declaration, specifying licensing terms and dependencies for a project.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the license and dependency declaration lines, which specify licensing terms and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data processing functions present that could lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow is observed; the code merely states licensing information.",
  "anomalies": "The only notable aspect is the multiple license declarations, which might indicate complex licensing conditions, but this is standard in open source projects.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is just license metadata without executable code or data processing logic. It does not include input sources, data handling, or output sinks. No suspicious or malicious behavior can be inferred from licensing statements alone. The snippet does not contain obfuscated code, malicious code, or malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "This is a non-executable licensing declaration snippet. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code simply states licensing terms without any active or potentially harmful logic.",
