  "purpose": "Define the public API of the module, explicitly specifying no exported symbols.",
  "sources": "No data sources; static assignment to __all__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static assignment without input or output.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; setting __all__ to an empty list, which is unusual but benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single line assigning an empty list to __all__, a common Python idiom for module exports. It contains no data sources, sinks, or flows, and no dynamic or obfuscated code. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. The code appears to be a placeholder or minimal module setup. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The code poses no security threat and is standard in Python modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, standard, and poses no security threat. The scores are appropriate and consistent with its benign nature. No changes are necessary.",
