{
  "purpose": "The code defines an empty list named __all__, which is typically used to specify public symbols for module exports.",
  "sources": "No data input sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data processing functions present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or data processing paths exist.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, but setting __all__ to an empty list could be a placeholder or indicate incomplete implementation; no suspicious activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single line that initializes __all__ as an empty list. This is a common Python practice to control module exports. There are no input sources, no data flows, and no suspicious or malicious operations. The code appears benign and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, minimal, and contains no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
