{
  "purpose": "The code defines an empty list named '__all__', which is typically used to specify public symbols for module exports.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling points present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or data propagation paths in the code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and does not contain any unusual or suspicious constructs. The use of '__all__' is standard in Python modules.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single line that declares an empty '__all__' list, which is common in Python modules to control what is exported when the module is imported. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The code is straightforward and serves a typical purpose in module design.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard module declaration with no malicious intent or security issues. The code is very minimal and does not pose any threat.",
