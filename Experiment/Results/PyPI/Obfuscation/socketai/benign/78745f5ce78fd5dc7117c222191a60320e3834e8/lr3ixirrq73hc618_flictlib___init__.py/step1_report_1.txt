{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define an empty list named __all__, which is typically used to specify public API elements of a module.",
  "sources": "None - the code does not read any input or data.",
  "sinks": "None - there are no operations that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present since the code is minimal and static.",
  "anomalies": "The code is unusually minimal; __all__ is defined but remains empty, which is uncommon but not inherently malicious. No other suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single variable __all__ as an empty list. This is often used in Python modules to declare the public API. There are no data sources, sinks, or dynamic code execution. The simplicity of the code suggests it's either a placeholder or intentionally minimal. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and serves a typical purpose in Python module structure without any malicious intent or security issues.",
