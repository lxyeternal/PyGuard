  "purpose": "Defines a module with an obfuscated variable storing the directory of the current script, with no active logic or data handling.",
  "sources": "os.path.dirname(__file__)",
  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "None",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable name; no data flows or suspicious operations",
  "analysis": "The code imports os, retrieves the directory of the current script, and assigns it to an obfuscated variable. No input/output, network activity, or malicious behavior is present. The obfuscation may be for concealment but does not indicate malicious intent. The code is minimal and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or security-threatening behavior. The obfuscated variable name is suspicious but not malicious. Scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware score is 0, obfuscation is moderate, and overall risk is negligible.",
