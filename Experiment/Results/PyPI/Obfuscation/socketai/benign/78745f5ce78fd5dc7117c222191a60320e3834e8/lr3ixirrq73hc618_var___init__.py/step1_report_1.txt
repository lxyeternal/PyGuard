{
  "purpose": "Define a module with an empty __all__ list, indicating no public API exports.",
  "sources": "os.path.dirname(__file__)",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or sensitive operations",
  "flows": "None present; no data flow from input to output or external systems",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable name 'vEykGFWvWOgCVzqegeVZKSCDcXPvrEVg', which appears obfuscated or randomly generated; no other suspicious activity",
  "analysis": "The code imports the os module and assigns a variable with the directory of the current script. The variable name is non-descriptive and appears obfuscated or intentionally obfuscated, which could be suspicious but is not inherently malicious. The __all__ list is empty, indicating no public API exposure. There are no other operations, no network activity, and no handling of untrusted input.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and non-malicious in function, but the use of an obfuscated variable name could suggest intent to conceal, though it does not execute any malicious behavior. No security risks are identified based on this code alone.",
