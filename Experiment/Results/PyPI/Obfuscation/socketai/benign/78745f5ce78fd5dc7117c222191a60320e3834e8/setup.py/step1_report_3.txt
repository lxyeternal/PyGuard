{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'flict' Python package, defining package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md, requirements.txt, and requirements-dev.txt files; importing version from flict.flictlib.flict_config.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; no untrusted data is used in a way that leads to data leakage or execution.",
  "flows": "Reading files -> passing dependencies to setuptools.setup; importing version -> used as package version.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are obfuscated or intentionally nonsensical, e.g., TKEQWTxeNvYdDIFgVigdpDfvjcxInkHk, which may suggest obfuscation but could also be just style. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code found. No evidence of malicious intent or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup operations: reading documentation and dependency files, importing version info, and calling setuptools.setup with metadata. Variable names are unusual but not necessarily malicious. No suspicious network activity, code injection, or data leaks are evident. The code appears to be a typical package setup with some obfuscated variable names, possibly for stylistic or minor obfuscation purposes. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with obfuscated variable names but no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any suspicious operations beyond standard package setup procedures.",
