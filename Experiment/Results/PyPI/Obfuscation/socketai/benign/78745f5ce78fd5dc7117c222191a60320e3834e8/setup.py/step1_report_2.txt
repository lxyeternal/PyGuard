{
  "purpose": "This script sets up a Python package called 'flict' by reading configuration data, README, and requirements files, then invoking setuptools.setup with the collected information.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md', 'requirements.txt', and 'requirements-dev.txt' files; imports 'flict_version' from a local module.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function and its parameters, including package metadata and dependencies, are the primary sinks; no untrusted data is directly used to influence system behavior beyond standard package setup.",
  "flows": "Reads files into variables, then passes collected data to setuptools.setup() without any modification or execution of untrusted code.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names and formatting (e.g., 'TKEQWTxeNvYdDIFgVigdpDfvjcxInkHk') suggest obfuscation, but are consistent with benign variable assignments. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code are evident. No dynamic execution, network activity, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup operations: reading documentation and requirements files, importing version info, and calling setuptools.setup with the collected data. Variable names are obfuscated but consistent. No data leaks, code injection, or malicious behavior are observed. The structure and flow are typical for a setup script. No suspicious or malicious logic is present, and no external network or file system manipulation occurs outside of reading files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. Despite obfuscated variable names, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The script does not perform any harmful actions, and the data handling appears benign.",
