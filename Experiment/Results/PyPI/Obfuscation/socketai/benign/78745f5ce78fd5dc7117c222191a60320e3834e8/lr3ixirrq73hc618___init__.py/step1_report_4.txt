  "purpose": "The code defines an empty list assigned to the special variable __all__, which typically indicates the public API of a module.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data sources are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data could cause harm are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths exist in the code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and contains no unusual constructs, secrets, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code solely assigns an empty list to __all__, a common pattern in Python modules to specify exported symbols. There are no inputs, outputs, or logic that could be malicious. The simplicity and lack of dynamic or complex operations indicate it is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
