  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, minimal code",
  "analysis": "The code assigns an empty list to __all__, a common Python pattern for module exports. It contains no functions, data input/output, external calls, or dynamic behavior. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is trivial and standard, with no security implications. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, all justified by the code's simplicity and benign nature. Confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python module placeholder with no malicious intent or security risks. All scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
