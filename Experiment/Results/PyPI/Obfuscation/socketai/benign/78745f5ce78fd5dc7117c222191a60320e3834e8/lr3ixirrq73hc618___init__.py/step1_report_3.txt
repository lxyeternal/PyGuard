{
  "purpose": "The code defines an empty list '__all__', likely intended to control module exports.",
  "sources": "No data sources; the code does not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with no suspicious or unusual patterns; defining __all__ as an empty list is a common practice to limit exports.",
  "analysis": "The code is simply an assignment of an empty list to __all__, which is a standard Python idiom to specify no public API from the module. There are no external data sources, sinks, or flows. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is benign, minimal code with no security risks or malicious intent. It likely serves as a placeholder or part of a larger module.",
