  "purpose": "The code defines an empty list '__all__', which is typically used to specify public API symbols for a module.",
  "sources": "No data sources, input, or external data read in this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data could cause vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "No data flow present, as the code only initializes an empty list.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and does not contain any unusual or suspicious constructs. The use of '__all__' in this manner is standard in Python modules.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns an empty list to '__all__'. There are no functions, variables, imports, or any other logic that could be malicious or indicate malicious intent. The code is a typical placeholder or initial module setup. No anomalies, no data inputs, and no suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is benign and standard practice in Python module definitions. There is no malicious behavior or security risk associated with this snippet.",
