  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a Python package intended for general functionality, with no clear specific goal from the provided fragment.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables, function parameters, and possibly external modules or data sources within the package.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file operations, or environment variable access, which could lead to data leakage or system modification if misused.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources such as environment variables or parameters through various functions to sinks like network or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No overt anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports are immediately apparent. However, the code structure and usage patterns need more context for thorough analysis.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and lacks explicit malicious patterns. It includes standard imports and likely some functional definitions. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious network activity is evident. Without additional context, the code appears benign but insufficiently detailed for a definitive conclusion.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there are no clear signs of malicious intent or security risks. The code seems typical for a Python package, but further analysis with more complete code could provide additional insights.",
