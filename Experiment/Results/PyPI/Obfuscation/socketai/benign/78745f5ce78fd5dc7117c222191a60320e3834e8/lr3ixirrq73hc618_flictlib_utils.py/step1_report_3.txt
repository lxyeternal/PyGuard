  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a standard Python script performing a specific task, possibly related to data processing or utility functions. No clear malicious intent is evident based on the visible code.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly visible; if environment variables or external inputs are used, they are not shown in the provided snippet. No specific data input points are identifiable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system commands are evident in the provided code fragment. No clear data leakage points are identified.",
  "flows": "Without explicit input/output operations or data transformations shown, there are no identifiable source-to-sink data flows in the provided snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code constructs are apparent. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets, obfuscated patterns, or unusual dynamic execution. No backdoors or hidden behaviors are visible.",
  "analysis": "A careful review of the entire code snippet reveals standard Python constructs and logic. No signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are detected. The code appears straightforward and benign. The lack of external inputs, network operations, or suspicious logic suggests no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The code appears to be normal, well-structured, and free from malicious anomalies. Confidence in this conclusion is high.",
