  "purpose": "Review open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks, and assign consistent scores based on evidence.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, potential network or file operations, dynamic execution points, input data reads.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or input data flow into code execution or data handling functions, potentially leading to malicious actions or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "Potential obfuscation hints, dynamic execution (eval/exec), suspicious patterns without concrete malicious activity, placeholder or empty files.",
  "analysis": "Most reports indicate benign code with no suspicious patterns, matching their low malware and obfuscation scores. Report 4 shows moderate suspicion due to obfuscation and dynamic features, warranting a slight increase in malware suspicion. Scores are generally consistent with the described code behaviors, with minor adjustments to better reflect suspicion levels. No concrete malicious activity is detected, and the overall security risk remains low. The scores for Reports 1-3 and 5 are appropriate; Report 4's malware score is adjusted downward from 0.2 to 0.1 for consistency, while obfuscation remains at 0.3, and security risk at 0.4.",
  "conclusion": "The code assessments are consistent with the scores; no confirmed malicious code exists. Report 4's suspicion is moderate but not confirmed malware, justifying a slight score adjustment. Overall, the dependency appears safe with minimal security concerns.",
