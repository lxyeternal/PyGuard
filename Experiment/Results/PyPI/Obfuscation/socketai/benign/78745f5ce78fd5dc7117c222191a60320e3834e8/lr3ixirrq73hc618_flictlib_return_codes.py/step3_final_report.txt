  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration for status codes with associated messages and provides a helper method to retrieve all enum descriptions.",
  "sources": "Enum class members and the class method NzsNvBGbatctVsBjtzvrACTJfmxYcDrS",
  "sinks": "None; no external input/output or data handling present",
  "flows": "N/A; static enum definitions without data flow or untrusted data sources",
  "anomalies": "Unusual, obfuscated class and method names; no malicious code or obfuscation in logic",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward enum class representing status codes with associated messages. It contains no dynamic code, external dependencies, or input/output operations. The class method likely returns help information about enum values. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation beyond naming, or security issues are detected. The code's benign nature is confirmed by multiple consistent reports. Obfuscation scores are justified by naming conventions but do not imply malicious intent. Malware scores are zero, and risk scores are very low, indicating no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard enumeration for status messaging with no malicious or security concerns. The obfuscated naming is suspicious but not malicious. Overall, the code poses no security risk.",
