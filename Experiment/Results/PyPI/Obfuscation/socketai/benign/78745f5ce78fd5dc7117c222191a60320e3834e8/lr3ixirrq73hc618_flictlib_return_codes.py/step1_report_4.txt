{
  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration class for status codes with associated messages, likely used for error handling or status reporting.",
  "sources": "Imports from the 'enum' module; class and method definitions within the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified that handle untrusted input or data; the code does not process external data directly.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the class defines static constants and a class method with no data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected. The method NzsNvBGbatctVsBjtzvrACTJfmxYcDrS appears to be a helper that returns a help string; its implementation is not shown but seems benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Enum subclass with several named constants mapping status codes to messages. The class method appears to generate or return help text, but its implementation is incomplete or placeholder. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activities. Usage of Enum and class methods is standard practice. No obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign definition of an enumeration for status/error codes with no signs of malware or malicious intent. It appears to serve a standard purpose within an application.",
