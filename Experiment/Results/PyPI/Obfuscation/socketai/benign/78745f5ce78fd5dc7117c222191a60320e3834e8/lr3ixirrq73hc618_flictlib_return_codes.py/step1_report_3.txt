{
  "purpose": "Define an enumeration class with status codes and associated messages, including a method to return help strings for all enum values.",
  "sources": "Class definition, enum members, and class method NzsNvBGbatctVsBjtzvrACTJfmxYcDrS",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present; no data leaks or external communications observed",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink flows; code only defines static enum data and a method returning static strings",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. The class and method are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an Enum class with several named members mapping integers to string messages, which is standard practice. The class method NzsNvBGbatctVsBjtzvrACTJfmxYcDrS simply returns a help string describing all enum values, with no dynamic or external data involved. No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or obfuscation are present. The overall structure appears normal and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical enum definition with a helper method. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected. It appears to be intended for status or error code management in a larger application.",
