{
  "purpose": "Define an enumeration for various status codes and messages related to project or expression validation, likely used for status reporting within a larger application.",
  "sources": "No external input sources detected; all data is hardcoded in enum definitions and class method.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data outputs; the class method returns a help string and does not perform any I/O or external communication.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code consists solely of static enum definitions and a class method returning a static string.",
  "anomalies": "The class and method appear to be straightforward; no suspicious or unusual code constructs, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no dynamic execution or external dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an Enum class with multiple members representing status codes and messages, which is a common pattern for status handling. The class method NzsNvBGbatctVsBjtzvrACTJfmxYcDrS provides a help string for enum values. There are no inputs, no outputs, and no external calls or data manipulation. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or sabotage are present. The structure and content are typical for a status enumeration used in software applications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Enum class used for status messaging, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It appears to be benign and designed solely for internal status referencing.",
