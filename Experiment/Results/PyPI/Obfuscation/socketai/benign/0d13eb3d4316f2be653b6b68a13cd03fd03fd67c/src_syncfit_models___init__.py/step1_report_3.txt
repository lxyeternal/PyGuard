  "purpose": "Import various models and utilities from the syncfit library for use in a larger application or analysis.",
  "sources": "Import statements from syncfit.models and syncfit.models.thermal_util",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; imports are from trusted modules, but potential misuse depends on how imported elements are used later.",
  "flows": "Imports from syncfit modules, which could lead to usage of potentially malicious code if the imported modules are compromised or maliciously altered.",
  "anomalies": "All imports are from local or standard package modules without apparent obfuscation or suspicious patterns. No hardcoded credentials or unusual code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements importing specific classes and modules from the syncfit package. There are no function calls, data handling, or network operations visible. The imported modules could potentially contain malicious code, but based on the given code, there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior, code injection, or data leaks. Since this is only an import block, the actual risk depends on the content of the imported modules, which is not visible here. There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code in these import statements themselves.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard import operations from a presumably legitimate package. There is no direct malicious activity visible in this snippet. However, the risk depends on the content of the imported modules, which cannot be assessed from these lines alone.",
