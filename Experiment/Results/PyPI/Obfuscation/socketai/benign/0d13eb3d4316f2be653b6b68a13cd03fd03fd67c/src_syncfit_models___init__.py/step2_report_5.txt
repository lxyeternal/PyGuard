  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** Purely static import statements from a consistent package, no dynamic code, no obfuscation, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is benign, straightforward, and contains no malware or security risks.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above—static imports, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Static imports from the package, but with a note that risk depends on the content of imported modules, which isn't visible here.\n- **Potential concern:** While the import statements themselves are benign, the report assigns a small security risk (0.2) due to potential misuse if imported modules are malicious.\n- **Assessment:** Since the import statements are static and straightforward, and no malicious code is visible, the risk score should remain low unless there's external evidence of malicious modules.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 seems slightly high for just import statements; perhaps 0.1 or lower would be more appropriate unless further evidence exists.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to above, static imports with no suspicious patterns.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, benign static imports.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious code or behavior is evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the static, straightforward import statements.\n- **Risk Score:** Most reports assign very low risk (0.1 or 0.2), which is reasonable given only import statements are shown. Since no dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious patterns are present, these risk scores are acceptable but could be slightly lowered to 0.1 for the majority, unless further context suggests otherwise.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The import statements themselves are standard and do not pose security risks.\n- The risk scores could be uniformly set to 0.1 for all reports, reflecting minimal concern based solely on static imports.\n- No changes needed for malware or obfuscated scores.\n\n### Overall:\n**Estimated malware score:** 0  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Estimated risk score:** 0.1\n\nThis conservative assessment aligns with the evidence—only static import statements, no malicious activity or obfuscation detected.",
