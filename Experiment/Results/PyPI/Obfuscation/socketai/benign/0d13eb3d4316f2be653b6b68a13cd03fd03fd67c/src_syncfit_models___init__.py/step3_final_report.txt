  "purpose": "Static import statements from 'syncfit.models' and related modules, likely for data or model loading.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'syncfit.models' package modules.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed; only static imports.",
  "flows": "Import statements themselves do not establish data flow; no dynamic code execution or data processing present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; straightforward static imports.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static import statements from a structured package, with no executable logic, dynamic code, or network activity. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are present. The import statements are standard and do not pose security risks. The risk scores assigned in the reports are very low, reflecting the static nature and lack of suspicious activity. The malware score is correctly set to 0, and obfuscation is absent. The slight variation in risk scores (0.1 or 0.2) is justified by the potential risk if imported modules are compromised, but from this snippet alone, there is no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of static import statements with no malicious or suspicious activity. The scores across reports are appropriate and consistent. The overall security risk is minimal, and no adjustments are necessary unless further analysis of the imported modules reveals malicious content.",
