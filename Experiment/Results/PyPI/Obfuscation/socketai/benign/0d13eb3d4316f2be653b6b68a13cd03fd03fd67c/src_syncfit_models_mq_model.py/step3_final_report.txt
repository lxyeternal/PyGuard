  "purpose": "Scientific modeling, likely astrophysics or thermal modeling involving complex physics calculations and parameter estimation.",
  "sources": "Input parameters, class attributes, imported modules, constants, and environment variables used in calculations.",
  "sinks": "Computed numerical results, likelihood evaluations, and physical measurements; no external data exfiltration or file/network I/O observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through physics calculations involving units and constants, into likelihood or model outputs.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation in variable and method names; no suspicious code, credentials, or malicious payloads detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs complex scientific computations with proper use of units and constants, extending a model class, and evaluating likelihoods. No network activity, file manipulation, or system commands are present. Obfuscation appears to be for concealment, not malicious intent. No signs of backdoors, data leaks, or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate scientific modeling code with significant obfuscation but no malicious activity. The high obfuscation likely aims to conceal implementation details rather than malicious sabotage. Security risk is minimal, and malware score is zero.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.8,
