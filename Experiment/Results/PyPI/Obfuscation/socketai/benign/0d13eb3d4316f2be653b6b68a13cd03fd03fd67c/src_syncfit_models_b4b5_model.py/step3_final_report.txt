  "purpose": "Implementation of a Bayesian/statistical modeling class with prior definitions and likelihood evaluation functions.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as prior bounds, model parameters, and external module imports.",
  "sinks": "Calculation of likelihood-like values, range checks, and return statements; no external data exfiltration or network activity.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through mathematical operations, exponentials, and range checks to output likelihood scores.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation via variable names; complex mathematical operations that could conceal malicious intent but appear consistent with statistical modeling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class inheriting from an external module, with methods performing likelihood calculations based on input parameters. Variable names are intentionally obscure, but the operations align with Bayesian inference. No network, file, or system manipulation is observed. The obfuscation appears superficial, likely stylistic or for concealment rather than malicious intent. The likelihood calculations and range checks are typical for probabilistic models. No signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of a Bayesian/statistical model with superficial obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation is likely stylistic, not malicious concealment.",
