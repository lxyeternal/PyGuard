{
  "purpose": "Implements a Bayesian/statistical model with priors and likelihood evaluations, performing internal probabilistic calculations.",
  "sources": "Reads input data parameters, class attributes, and prior distributions; uses numpy for mathematical operations.",
  "sinks": "No external data transmission or network calls; internal calculations only.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters and priors through mathematical functions to return likelihood scores or feasibility indicators.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of variable and method names; complex math functions typical of probabilistic models; no signs of malicious code or external communication.",
  "analysis": "The code performs complex Bayesian inference calculations, involving exponentials, powers of 10, and inverse operations, consistent with likelihood or model evaluation. No network, file, or environment manipulation is present. Obfuscation appears to be for concealment or intellectual property reasons, not malicious intent. The functions return scores or -np.inf based on logical conditions, typical in probabilistic modeling. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection are evident. The heavy obfuscation warrants caution but does not imply malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a complex, obfuscated Bayesian/statistical implementation with no evidence of malicious behavior. The high obfuscation level warrants cautious review, but based on the analysis, it appears benign and intended for probabilistic modeling purposes.",
