  "purpose": "Implementation of a probabilistic or Bayesian inference model involving prior distributions and complex mathematical calculations.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as prior distributions, data variables passed into mathematical functions within methods.",
  "sinks": "Mathematical operations influencing internal state; no external I/O or system interactions detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into exponentials, powers, and conditional checks, influencing return values and internal calculations.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated variable names, complex math functions, and the use of -np.inf as a return value, which could be a control signal or error indicator.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a complex probabilistic model with obfuscated variable names and mathematical expressions. No network, file, or system modifications are present. The use of -np.inf may serve as a control signal, but does not indicate malicious activity. Obfuscation is significant but could be for proprietary reasons. The return of -np.inf is notable but not inherently malicious. Overall, the code appears to perform internal statistical calculations without external malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain overt malware or malicious behavior. Obfuscation and the signaling use of -np.inf warrant caution but are not definitive indicators of malicious intent. The overall security risk is low, with a slight concern due to obfuscation and control signals. Malware likelihood is minimal.",
