{
  "purpose": "The code defines a subclass extending an imported class, performing complex mathematical calculations likely for statistical or modeling purposes.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to the method, including prior values and various parameters for calculations.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network, or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into mathematical expressions involving exponentiation, division, and powers within the method.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated variable names and complex formulas; no hardcoded credentials or malicious strings.",
  "analysis": "The code is heavily obfuscated with complex mathematical formulas that appear legitimate for statistical or modeling tasks. No network, file, or system modification operations are evident. The obfuscation seems intentional but does not indicate malicious intent. The malware score is appropriately set to 0, and the security risk is low due to the absence of external effects or vulnerabilities. The obfuscation score is high but justified given the variable naming and formula complexity. Confidence in these conclusions is high, as the code appears to be a legitimate, albeit obfuscated, mathematical implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a complex, obfuscated mathematical or statistical implementation with no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. The high obfuscation is likely for proprietary or intellectual property reasons, not malicious intent. The assigned scores are consistent with the analysis, and no modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.75,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.2,
