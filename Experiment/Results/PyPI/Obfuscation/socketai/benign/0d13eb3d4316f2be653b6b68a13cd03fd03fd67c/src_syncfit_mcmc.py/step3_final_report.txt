  "purpose": "Performs Bayesian inference using nested sampling and MCMC for statistical modeling and parameter estimation.",
  "sources": "Input data arrays, prior dictionaries, and model parameters; reads from numpy arrays and function arguments.",
  "sinks": "Returns processed parameter estimates and likelihoods; no network, file, or secret leaks detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays through models and sampling routines, culminating in output parameter lists.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, complex import of 'PicklingError' for exception handling, dynamic model class usage, and complex flow control.",
  "analysis": "The code performs scientific Bayesian inference with standard libraries (emcee, dynesty), using multiprocessing for parallel sampling. Variable names are highly complex and non-descriptive, indicating obfuscation but not malicious intent. No network activity, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious data handling are present. Exception handling around pickling suggests serialization concerns, typical in parallel processing. The obfuscation level is notable but appears to serve internal naming conventions rather than conceal malicious code. The overall structure and behavior align with legitimate scientific modeling routines, with no evidence of malicious payloads or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate scientific Bayesian inference software with obfuscated variable names. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious activity are evident. The obfuscation is likely for internal clarity or complexity, not malicious concealment. The security risk is low, but the obfuscation warrants cautious validation before deployment in sensitive environments.",
