  "purpose": "Importing specific classes and modules from internal package components for use within the package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules: ._version, .mcmc, and the entire models and analysis modules.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or perform actions with potential security impact.",
  "flows": "Import statements do not establish data flow paths involving untrusted input; they merely import code definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual class names such as ReUDvcLBnCJKslvbwCHNcvlxqBrNFDaG, SkWoCnBWvDHTuvFHIFfbVNoyIBbDgafs, and SeCxsHFPDtWHZgAWLMdbhjIVQXFtZADj may suggest obfuscation or generated code. The import of these classes indicates potential code obfuscation or hiding functionality. No credentials, network calls, or other suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from internal modules, including one version identifier and two classes with seemingly nonsensical names. The presence of obfuscated class names could suggest an attempt to hide malicious or sensitive code, but without further context or implementation details, these imports alone are not inherently malicious. No external data, environment variables, or suspicious operations are evident. The code appears to be part of a larger package structure, and the import of these classes does not by itself indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is limited to import statements, with suspiciously obfuscated class names suggesting possible obfuscation or concealment tactics. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks based solely on this snippet. Further context from the imported modules would be needed for a thorough assessment, but the current snippet does not raise security concerns.",
