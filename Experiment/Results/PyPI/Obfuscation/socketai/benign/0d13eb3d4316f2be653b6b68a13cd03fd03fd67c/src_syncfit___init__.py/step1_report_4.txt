  "sinks": "None evident; no data outputs or network connections shown.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources; purely import statements.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated class and module names, which can be suspicious. No other code or behavior present.",
  "analysis": "The code contains import statements for internal modules and classes, with names that appear intentionally obfuscated. There are no input sources, data processing, or sink points visible. The obfuscation could be an attempt to conceal malicious intent, but based solely on these import statements, no malicious behavior is observable. The code does not perform any actions or data handling beyond importing modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is limited to import statements with obfuscated identifiers, which can be suspicious but are not necessarily malicious on their own. No malicious activity or security risks are evident within this fragment. The obfuscation warrants caution, but with the provided code, there is no concrete evidence of malicious intent.",
