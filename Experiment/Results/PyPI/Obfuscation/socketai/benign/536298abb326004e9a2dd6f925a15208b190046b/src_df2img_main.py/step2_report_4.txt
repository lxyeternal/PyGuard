  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code generates a styled Plotly table from pandas data, reading from Series/DataFrame, with styling options.\n- **Sinks:** Uses `show()` and `write_image()`.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No suspicious external activity, no hardcoded credentials, variable naming obfuscated but functionally legitimate.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a utility for data visualization, with no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0.0, Security Risk: 0.2, Obfuscated: 0.7, Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, generating Plotly figures from pandas data.\n- **Sinks:** Writes image files.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No external data, network activity, or secrets; straightforward visualization.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Benign utility; no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Security Risk: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Confidence: 1\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same general purpose.\n- **Sinks:** Save figure as image.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** Obfuscated variable names, but no external activity or malicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Benign visualization code, obfuscation appears to be for concealment but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0.0, Security Risk: 0.2, Obfuscated: 0.8, Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar visualization purpose.\n- **Sinks:** Save figure image.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** Obfuscated code, complex internal functions, but no external communication or secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Utility for visualization, obfuscation may hinder readability but no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Security Risk: 0.2, Obfuscated: 0.8, Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same purpose.\n- **Sinks:** Save image.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** Obfuscated names, HTML tags in labels, but no external or malicious activity.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Likely a visualization utility, obfuscation present but no malicious signals.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Security Risk: 0.2, Obfuscated: 0.8, Confidence: 0.8\n\n---\n\n### Critical Review & Justification:\n\n- **Presence of Malicious Behavior:**  \n  No evidence of malware, backdoors, network activity, or data exfiltration. The code is focused on data visualization and exporting images, which is common and benign.\n\n- **Obfuscation & Variable Naming:**  \n  The variable and function names are intentionally obfuscated, which could be a concern for code transparency but not inherently malicious. Obfuscation alone does not imply malware.\n\n- **Write Image Functionality:**  \n  The use of `write_image()` could, in theory, be misused to exfiltrate data if combined with malicious code, but in this context, it appears to be a standard feature for exporting visualizations.\n\n- **Potential Risks:**  \n  The only notable concern is obfuscation, which might hinder code review and understanding. However, no malicious intent is evident.\n\n- **Scores Evaluation:**  \n  The malware scores are appropriately low (0.0 or 0). Security risk scores are slightly elevated (0.2) possibly due to obfuscation, but not justified as a serious risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at **0.0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Given the obfuscation, a score of **0.7–0.8** is justified.\n- **Risk Score:** Should stay low, around **0.2**, as the code is primarily for visualization and export.\n\n### Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.75 (average of reports)  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.2\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a legitimate data visualization utility with obfuscated variable names. No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious activity is present. The obfuscation may be a concern for code review but does not elevate the security risk significantly.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Continue monitoring for obfuscation patterns, but based on this analysis, no immediate security threat exists.",
