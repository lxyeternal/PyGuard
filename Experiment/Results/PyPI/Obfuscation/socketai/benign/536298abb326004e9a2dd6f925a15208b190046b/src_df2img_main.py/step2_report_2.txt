  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a utility to generate styled Plotly tables from pandas data, with no evidence of malicious activity. Obfuscated variable names are noted but deemed legitimate.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0.0, securityRisk=0.2, obfuscated=0.7, confidence=0.9\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. No malicious behavior is evident. The obfuscation is high but appears to be an attempt to hide complexity rather than malicious intent. The security risk is low, considering the code's purpose.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is a benign visualization utility with no malicious activity. Obfuscation is minimal.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1\n\n- **Assessment:** The conclusion aligns with the code's apparent purpose. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a benign visualization utility, with obfuscated variable names but no malicious activity. No network or data exfiltration detected.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0.0, securityRisk=0.2, obfuscated=0.8, confidence=0.9\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. Obfuscation is high but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a complex, obfuscated visualization script with no malicious behavior. Obfuscation is high, but no malicious intent is evident.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, obfuscated=0.8, confidence=0.9\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is appropriate. The obfuscation could be for concealment but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, emphasizing benign purpose, with obfuscation but no malicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, obfuscated=0.8, confidence=0.8\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code's function.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0 or 0.0, which is appropriate. The code does not exhibit malicious behaviors such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Ranges from 0.7 to 0.8, which seems reasonable given the variable and function names are intentionally obscure but serve legitimate purposes.\n\n- **Security Risk Score:** Slightly elevated at 0.2 across reports, which seems fair considering the code can write images to disk and display figures. However, since no malicious activity is detected, this remains low.\n\n- **Purpose & Behavior:** The code is a visualization utility, not an attack vector or malware.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis. The malware score should remain at 0, as no malicious activity is evident.\n\n- The obfuscated score is justified given the variable naming, but it's not excessively high to suggest malicious intent.\n\n- The security risk score is appropriately low but could be slightly increased if considering potential misuse (e.g., writing images to arbitrary locations), but given the context, 0.2 is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimated Scores:\n\n- **Malware:** **0.0** — No malicious behavior detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** **0.75** — Variable names are intentionally obscure but do not indicate malicious intent.\n\n- **Security Risk:** **0.2** — Low risk, primarily due to file writing capabilities, but no active threats.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is a legitimate data visualization utility with obfuscated variable names. No malware or malicious activity is evident. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and should remain as they are, with perhaps a slight adjustment to obfuscated score to 0.75 for clarity.",
