{
  "purpose": "Generate a styled Plotly table from pandas data, with options for layout, styling, and exporting as an image.",
  "sources": "Reads pandas Series or DataFrame, accesses pandas index and columns, and uses input parameters for styling.",
  "sinks": "Uses plotly.graph_objects.Figure's show() method and write_image() to display and save the visualization.",
  "flows": "Data is read from pandas objects; styling parameters are applied; figure is generated; optionally displayed and saved as an image.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names; no external network activity or hardcoded secrets; potential overuse of dynamic styling.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a Plotly table visualization from pandas data, applying styles and layout options. It includes nested functions for processing data and styling. Variable names are intentionally obfuscated, but the logic is consistent with a visualization utility. No evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection. The use of write_image() is standard for exporting figures. Obfuscation is notable but not indicative of malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0 or 0.2, obfuscated=0.75-0.8, securityRisk=0.2) are justified given the code's functionality and obfuscation level.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate data visualization utility that generates styled Plotly tables from pandas data. It employs obfuscated variable names but does not contain malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The scores across reports are appropriate; malware is absent, obfuscation is high but not malicious, and the security risk is low. No modifications are necessary.",
