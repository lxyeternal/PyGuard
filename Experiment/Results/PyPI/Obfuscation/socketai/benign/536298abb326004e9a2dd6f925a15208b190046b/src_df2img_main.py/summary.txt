  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate data visualization utility that generates styled Plotly tables from pandas data. It employs obfuscated variable names but does not contain malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The scores across reports are appropriate; malware is absent, obfuscation is high but not malicious, and the security risk is low. No modifications are necessary."
