{
  "purpose": "Generate and display a styled Plotly table figure based on input pandas data, with customizable layout and styling options.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from pandas Series/DataFrame, reads layout configuration from function parameters and titles.",
  "sinks": "Uses Plotly's show() to display the figure; writes the figure image to a specified file path via write_image().",
  "flows": "Input data is processed to create table headers and cells, then passed to Plotly for rendering and saving.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Variable naming is obfuscated but seems to serve legitimate functions.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a Plotly figure with a table based on pandas data. It includes functions for preparing header labels and data rows, applies style updates, and renders or saves the figure. There is no evidence of malicious network activity, data theft, or system compromise. The obfuscated variable names and flexible layout updates suggest complexity but not malicious intent. The use of 'write_image' indicates potential for data exfiltration if misused, but within this context, it appears to be a legitimate feature for exporting visualizations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for generating and exporting styled Plotly tables from pandas data. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident based on this code fragment.",
