  "purpose": "Generate and customize Plotly table figures from pandas data structures with options for styling and layout.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from pandas Series/DataFrame objects, optional function parameters for styling and layout.",
  "sinks": "Uses Plotly's write_image method to save figures, potentially writing to file paths provided.",
  "flows": "Data flows from pandas objects through figure creation, with styling updates based on parameters, then saved via write_image.",
  "anomalies": "Code contains highly obfuscated function and variable names, unnecessary string concatenations with HTML tags, and dynamic layout updates. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious string patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to create a Plotly figure displaying a pandas DataFrame or Series as a table. It includes internal helper functions for processing the data and layout styling, with optional customization parameters. The obfuscation of variable and function names suggests an attempt to hide the code's purpose or make it less readable, but no malicious payload or behavior is evident. The code uses standard libraries and Plotly functions without suspicious network activity, external calls, or data exfiltration. The 'write_image' function writes the figure to a user-specified path; this could be misused if combined with malicious inputs, but on its own, it’s a normal operation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard data visualization utility for generating styled tables from pandas data, with obfuscated naming but no malicious intent or security risk evident. The obfuscation might hinder readability but does not indicate malicious behavior. The write_image function is a normal feature for exporting images. No malicious signals such as backdoors, unauthorized data collection, or harmful network activity are detected.",
