  "purpose": "Test functions for the df2img library, generating visualizations from pandas DataFrames, saving images, and performing assertions on figure properties.",
  "sources": "DataFrames created within fixtures, which are used as input for visualization functions.",
  "sinks": "Generated figures, saved image files on disk, and deleted files after testing.",
  "flows": "DataFrames flow into df2img functions to produce figures, which are then saved to disk; no external or untrusted data sources are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected. Variable names are obfuscated but consistent with test code. File operations are standard for testing image output.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of test functions that generate pandas DataFrames with NaN values and styled configurations, invoke df2img to produce figures, save images to disk, and clean up files. No external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. Variable names are intentionally obscure, but this is typical in test or auto-generated code. The file operations are standard in testing scenarios. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are identified. The code's purpose is benign, focused on visualization testing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of test functions for the df2img visualization library. No malicious activity or security risks are present. The obfuscation observed is limited to variable naming and does not indicate malicious intent. The overall security risk score should be very low, and malware score should be zero.",
