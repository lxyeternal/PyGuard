      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code snippet is minimal but contains obfuscated function names, which warrants suspicion. There is no direct evidence of malicious activity, but the obfuscation and inconsistency in exports suggest further investigation is necessary. The current scores of malware at 0.2 and obfuscation at 0.7 are appropriate, with a moderate security risk around 0.3-0.4. Additional review of the 'df2img' package functions is advised before trusting or deploying this code."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate data visualization utility that generates styled Plotly tables from pandas data. It employs obfuscated variable names but does not contain malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The scores across reports are appropriate; malware is absent, obfuscation is high but not malicious, and the security risk is low. No modifications are necessary."

      "conclusion": "The code appears benign with minor suspicion related to obfuscation or opacity. No evidence of malware or high security risk is present. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and further static or dynamic analysis could be considered if suspicion persists."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of test functions for the df2img visualization library. No malicious activity or security risks are present. The obfuscation observed is limited to variable naming and does not indicate malicious intent. The overall security risk score should be very low, and malware score should be zero."
