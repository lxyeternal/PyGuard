  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, input functions, network requests, dynamic code execution points, obfuscated strings.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file system access, environment variable access, eval/exec calls.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or input functions flow into processing functions, possibly leading to network transmission or file modifications.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal comments, obscure variable names, potential obfuscation, dynamic code execution indicators, minimal transparency.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits minimal obfuscation with some suspicion of dynamic or opaque behavior. No concrete malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or damaging system files is evident. The suspicion levels are low, with no significant security flaws identified. The code's benign nature is supported by the absence of suspicious patterns, and the scores reflect cautious assessment without definitive malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with minor suspicion related to obfuscation or opacity. No evidence of malware or high security risk is present. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and further static or dynamic analysis could be considered if suspicion persists.",
