  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script with no explicit purpose stated; it seems to perform some computation or processing based on imported modules and defined functions.",
  "sources": "Data sources include environment variables, input functions, or external modules that may accept user input or external data; specifics cannot be determined due to absence of explicit data reading in provided code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or system commands; however, no such operations are explicitly present in the code snippet provided.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources through variables and functions; in absence of specific data operations or untrusted input handling, no suspicious flow is identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code does not contain obfuscated or malicious constructs. No unusual language features or dynamic code execution are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward with clear structure. It does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration. It uses standard Python constructs and libraries without suspicious patterns. Without additional context or external dependencies, no malicious behavior or security risks are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. The code appears benign and standard in its functionality.",
