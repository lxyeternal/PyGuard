{
  "purpose": "This code imports specific functions from the 'df2img.main' module and defines the exported symbols for the module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'df2img.main', which may load external code or data when the module is imported.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present in this snippet; no untrusted data handling or external communication is visible.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code only performs imports and sets __all__, with no data flows or processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "The imported functions have obfuscated or nonsensical names ('nIeuNqyPXxKWYHdxKsrhehpwhsyYrbBy', 'bbFVyrigLnnDgskbGGclldlJpduedtzv'), which could be an attempt to hide malicious intent or obfuscate functionality. No other suspicious activity is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two functions with highly obfuscated names from a module. The __all__ list defines exports. The obfuscated function names are unusual and could be used to hide malicious code or functionality. The code itself does not execute any logic beyond imports and symbol declaration, but the obfuscation warrants further scrutiny of the imported functions and the 'df2img' package.\n\nGiven only this snippet, the main concern is the obfuscated function names, which could be a tactic to hide malicious behavior or malware. No direct malicious activity or data leaks are apparent from this fragment alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a minimal import statement with obfuscated function names, which could indicate malicious intent or obfuscation. Further review of the imported functions and package contents is recommended. Based on this snippet alone, potential risk exists due to obfuscation, but no explicit malicious activity is detected.",
