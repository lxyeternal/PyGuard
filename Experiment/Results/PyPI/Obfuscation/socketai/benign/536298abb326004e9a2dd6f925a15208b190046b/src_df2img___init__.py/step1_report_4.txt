  "sinks": "No evident sinks or data flows to untrusted sources or external systems",

  "anomalies": "Presence of seemingly random, nonsensical function names (nIeuNqyPXxKWYHdxKsrhehpwhsyYrbBy, bbFVyrigLnnDgskbGGclldlJpduedtzv), which could suggest obfuscation or malicious intent; no documentation or context provided",
  "analysis": "The code imports two functions with complex, nonsensical names from a module, which may indicate obfuscation or an attempt to hide malicious functions. The list '__all__' specifies publicly accessible functions but does not clarify their behavior. No other code, such as function calls, data handling, or network operations, is present. The unusual naming warrants suspicion, but without further context or function definitions, the code alone does not demonstrate malicious activity. It appears as a minimal module import with obfuscated identifiers.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal and primarily imports functions with obscure names, which could be suspicious. However, based solely on this snippet, there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior. The suspicious naming suggests possible obfuscation, so caution is advised. Overall, it does not demonstrate clear malicious intent but warrants further review if more code is available.",
