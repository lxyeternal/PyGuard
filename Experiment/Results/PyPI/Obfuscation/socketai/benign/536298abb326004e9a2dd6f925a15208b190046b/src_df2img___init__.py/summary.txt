  "confidence": 0.75,
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is minimal but contains obfuscated function names, which warrants suspicion. There is no direct evidence of malicious activity, but the obfuscation and inconsistency in exports suggest further investigation is necessary. The current scores of malware at 0.2 and obfuscation at 0.7 are appropriate, with a moderate security risk around 0.3-0.4. Additional review of the 'df2img' package functions is advised before trusting or deploying this code."
