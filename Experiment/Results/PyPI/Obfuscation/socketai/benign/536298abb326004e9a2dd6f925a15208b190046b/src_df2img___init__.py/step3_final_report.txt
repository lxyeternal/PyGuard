{
  "purpose": "Import specific functions from the 'df2img.main' module for image generation or processing tasks related to dataframes.",
  "sources": "The imported functions 'nIeuNqyPXxKWYHdxKsrhehpwhsyYrbBy' and 'bbFVyrigLnnDgskbGGclldlJpduedtzv' are sourced from the 'df2img.main' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this code snippet; there are no data outputs, network calls, or external interactions.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows within this snippet; the code only imports functions and defines an export list.",
  "anomalies": "The imported functions have highly obfuscated, non-descriptive names, which is suspicious. Additionally, the '__all__' list references 'plot_dataframe' and 'save_dataframe', which are not imported or defined here, indicating inconsistency or incomplete code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two functions with obfuscated names, raising suspicion of potential hiding of malicious code. The '__all__' list suggests intended exports, but the mismatch with imported functions indicates possible obfuscation or incomplete code. No data processing, network activity, or malicious behavior is directly observable. The obfuscated names justify a high suspicion score, but the lack of evidence keeps malware risk low. The overall structure is minimal but suspicious due to naming patterns. Further review of the actual functions in 'df2img' is recommended to confirm their behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is minimal but contains obfuscated function names, which warrants suspicion. There is no direct evidence of malicious activity, but the obfuscation and inconsistency in exports suggest further investigation is necessary. The current scores of malware at 0.2 and obfuscation at 0.7 are appropriate, with a moderate security risk around 0.3-0.4. Additional review of the 'df2img' package functions is advised before trusting or deploying this code.",
