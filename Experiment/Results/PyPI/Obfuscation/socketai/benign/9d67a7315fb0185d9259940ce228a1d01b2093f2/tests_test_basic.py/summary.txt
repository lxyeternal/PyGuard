  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a heavily obfuscated validation or testing script that interacts with an external module. While obfuscation is suspicious, there is no evidence of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, system modification, or network communication. The risk and malware scores are appropriately low, reflecting the lack of active threats but acknowledging the obfuscation concern. Continued monitoring and further analysis of the external module are recommended before deploying in sensitive environments."
