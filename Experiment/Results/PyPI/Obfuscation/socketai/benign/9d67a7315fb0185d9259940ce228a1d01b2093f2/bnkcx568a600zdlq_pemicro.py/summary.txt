  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, albeit obfuscated, hardware debugging interface for PEMicro tools. There is no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The primary concern is ensuring DLLs are trusted and secure, as dynamic loading could be exploited if DLLs are tampered with. Overall, the security risk is low, with a high likelihood that this is proprietary debugging utility code."
