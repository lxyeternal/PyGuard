{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'pypemicro' intended to distribute a tool for controlling PEMicro Debug probes.",
  "sources": "Reads content from 'README.md' and 'HISTORY.md' files, and defines package metadata and dependencies within the script.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data execution or data leakage present.",
  "flows": "Reads files for long descriptions; uses package metadata to configure setup process.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names are used throughout, which is unusual for typical setup scripts. No suspicious code execution, network activity, or hidden logic observed. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and reads description files to prepare package metadata. Variable names are intentionally obfuscated, but the code performs standard setup operations. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or suspicious behavior is present. The obfuscation appears to be stylistic or to avoid easy detection, but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a typical Python package setup script with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The obfuscation alone does not imply malicious intent.",

  "obfuscated": 0.8,
