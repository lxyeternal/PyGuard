  "confidence": 0.9,
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script that reads README and HISTORY files for long descriptions, defines package metadata with obfuscated variable names, and calls setup(). No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted data handling is present. The obfuscation appears stylistic rather than malicious. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious constructs are detected. The scores assigned in the reports—malware at 0, obfuscated around 0.75-0.8, and low security risk—are consistent with the benign analysis. The code performs typical setup operations with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation appears stylistic rather than malicious. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
