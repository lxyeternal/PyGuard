  "purpose": "No purpose can be determined as the code is only a shebang line and a coding declaration without any functional code.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in the provided code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No data or untrusted input handling or processing occurs.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present due to the absence of code.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a shebang and a coding declaration with no executable content, which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is just a shebang line ('#!/usr/bin/env python') and an encoding declaration ('# -*- coding: UTF-8 -*-') with no additional code, logic, or data handling. It does not perform any operations, data processing, or interactions. Since there is no executable code, input, output, or third-party library usage, there are no security concerns, malicious behaviors, or anomalies present in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal script header without any executable content, posing no security risk or malicious intent. It appears to be part of a larger script but, on its own, it is benign.",
