  "purpose": "This code serves as a minimal Python script header, indicating the interpreter location and encoding, with no executable logic or data processing.",
  "sources": "N/A (no data input or external data sources present in the code snippet).",
  "sinks": "N/A (no untrusted data handling or output points in the code).",
  "flows": "N/A (no data flow or source-to-sink paths due to absence of executable code).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code contains only shebang and encoding comments, with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple header with no logic, input, or output. All reports correctly identify the absence of executable content and malicious behavior. Scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately set to 0, with high confidence levels. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code is benign and poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code fragment is harmless, containing only header comments with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are accurate and consistent with the code's content.",
