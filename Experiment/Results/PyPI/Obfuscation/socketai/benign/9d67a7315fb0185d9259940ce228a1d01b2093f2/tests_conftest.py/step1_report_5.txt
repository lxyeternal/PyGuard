{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple script that imports the pytest testing framework, likely for running or defining tests.",
  "sources": "The import statement for pytest, which is a standard testing library; no other data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks since the code only contains an import statement and no further logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and does not contain any suspicious or unusual constructs; it lacks any obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the pytest module, indicating it may be used for testing purposes. There are no inputs, outputs, or other logic present. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are evident in this snippet. The code's simplicity and lack of executable logic reduce the likelihood of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, primarily serving as a setup for testing with pytest. No malicious behavior, security issues, or anomalies are detected in this snippet.",
