  "purpose": "Minimal Python script importing pytest, likely for testing or setup purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement of pytest; no external data sources or inputs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data output, network activity, or file operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only imports a module without further processing.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a shebang, encoding declaration, and an import statement for pytest. It contains no functions, data flows, or external data sources. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The code appears to be a placeholder or boilerplate for testing purposes. Given its minimal and benign nature, there are no security risks or malware indicators. The confidence in this assessment is high, as the code is straightforward and lacks suspicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, minimal, and intended for testing or setup. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all 0, consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
