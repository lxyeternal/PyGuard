  "purpose": "This code is likely intended for running tests using the pytest framework.",
  "sources": "Imports the pytest module, which is a testing framework.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow observed; no source-to-sink paths due to absence of executable code beyond import.",
  "anomalies": "Only import statement; no suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior present.",
  "analysis": "The script contains only a shebang, encoding declaration, and an import statement for pytest. There are no functions, classes, or executable code that could be exploited or indicate malicious intent. The presence of pytest suggests a testing context but does not imply malicious behavior by itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of an import statement for a testing library with no suspicious or malicious activity.",
