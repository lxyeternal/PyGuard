  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- The code is just a shebang, encoding declaration, and `import pytest`.\n- No sources, sinks, flows, or anomalies.\n- Conclusion states it's benign.\n- Confidence is 0.8, malware and securityRisk are 0.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code is minimal and non-malicious. No changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar minimal code with shebang, encoding, and `import pytest`.\n- No suspicious elements.\n- Confidence is 0.9, malware and securityRisk are 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is benign. No changes needed.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same pattern: shebang, encoding, `import pytest`.\n- No anomalies or suspicious activity.\n- Confidence is 1, malware and securityRisk are 0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Again, minimal code with import pytest.\n- No suspicious activity.\n- Confidence 0.9, malware 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same minimal pattern.\n- No anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n- Confidence 1, malware 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code snippet is benign, minimal, and non-malicious.\n- The scores assigned (mostly 0 or 0.9/1 for confidence, 0 for malware and security risk) are appropriate given the simplicity of the code.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security issues.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware scores:** Should remain at 0, as no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** Should remain at 0, as the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk scores:** Given the code's benign nature, should stay at 0.\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The high confidence scores are justified due to the simplicity and lack of suspicious features.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and reasoning across all reports.",
