  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths are present in the code.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only import statements and metadata; no suspicious or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is minimal, consisting solely of a shebang, encoding declaration, and an import statement for pytest. There are no functions, classes, or executable code. It appears to be a fragment or a placeholder, not a complete program. No malicious behavior or security issues are detectable within this limited snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, containing only metadata and an import statement with no apparent malicious intent or security risks.",
