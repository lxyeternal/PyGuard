  "purpose": "The code appears to import constants and functions from the 'pypemicro' package, likely to be used for some microcontroller or embedded system interactions.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'pypemicro.pemicro_const' and 'pypemicro.pemicro'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in the provided code fragment.",
  "flows": "No data flow can be determined from the import statements alone.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only importing modules. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns are evident in these lines.",
  "analysis": "The script only imports modules and does not perform any operations, data handling, or execution. Without further code, there are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The import statements are standard for modular Python code, assuming 'pypemicro' is a legitimate package.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard import setup with no suspicious activity.",
