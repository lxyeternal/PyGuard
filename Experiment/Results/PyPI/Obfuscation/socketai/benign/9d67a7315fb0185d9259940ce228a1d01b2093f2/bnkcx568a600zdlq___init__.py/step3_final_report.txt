  "purpose": "Assess the supply chain security and malicious potential of the provided Python code snippet, which consists solely of import statements from the 'pypemicro' package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'pypemicro.pemicro_const' and 'pypemicro.pemicro' modules.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows are present in the code snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; only static import statements are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected; the code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only import statements from a legitimate open-source hardware interaction library. No functions, data processing, network activity, or execution logic are present. The malware score is set to 0, obfuscation score to 0, and security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting the benign nature of the code. The high confidence score (0.9) is justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are evident. The scores are consistent with the evidence, and the code does not pose any security threat in isolation.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on the provided import statements, there is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code appears benign, and the assigned scores are appropriate. Further security assessment should consider the actual usage of these modules in the full codebase, but as it stands, the supply chain risk is negligible.",
