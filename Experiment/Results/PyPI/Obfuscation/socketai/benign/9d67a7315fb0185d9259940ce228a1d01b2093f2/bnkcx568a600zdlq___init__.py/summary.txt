  "conclusion": "Based solely on the provided import statements, there is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code appears benign, and the assigned scores are appropriate. Further security assessment should consider the actual usage of these modules in the full codebase, but as it stands, the supply chain risk is negligible."
