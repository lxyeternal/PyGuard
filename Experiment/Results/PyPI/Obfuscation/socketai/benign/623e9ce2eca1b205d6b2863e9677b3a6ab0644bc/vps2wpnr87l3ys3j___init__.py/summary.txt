  "conclusion": "The code functions as a suspicious automation toolkit with high obfuscation and environment manipulation features. While it does not contain explicit malware payloads, its capabilities for social media automation, spoofing, and self-updating mechanisms pose security risks if exploited maliciously. The overall malware score is moderate, and the obfuscation and risk levels are high, warranting caution."
