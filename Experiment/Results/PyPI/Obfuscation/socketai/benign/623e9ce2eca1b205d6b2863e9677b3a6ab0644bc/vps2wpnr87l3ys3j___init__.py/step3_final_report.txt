{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a Facebook automation toolkit, generating random user agents, stylized text art, and performing social media interactions such as following users. It also includes self-update mechanisms via git pull and extensive obfuscation techniques.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, cookies, URL responses, and system info; imports modules conditionally; executes system commands for package management and updates.",
  "sinks": "System commands (`os.system`), network requests (`requests`, `httpx`), Facebook interaction functions that perform HTTP requests with cookies, and dynamic code execution via base64 operations.",
  "flows": "Inputs such as cookies, URL data, and random data flow into network requests and system commands; obfuscated variables and concatenated strings obscure data flow paths; environment manipulation influences behavior.",
  "anomalies": "Repeated `pip install` commands with incomplete or redundant calls, use of `git pull` during import, heavy obfuscation with variable names and string concatenation, functions generating spoofed device info and IDs, Facebook automation functions that scrape or perform actions, dynamic import handling, and base64 encoding/decoding.",
  "analysis": "The code is heavily obfuscated, with multiple conditional module imports and environment manipulation commands. It performs social media automation (e.g., following, scraping settings), generates fake device and user data, and updates itself via `git pull`. No explicit malicious payloads such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or destructive commands are present. However, its capabilities for automation, environment control, and obfuscation pose significant security concerns if misused. The repeated environment modifications and automation functions could facilitate privacy violations, impersonation, or spam activities. The obfuscation complicates detection and analysis, indicating an intent to evade scrutiny.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a suspicious automation toolkit with high obfuscation and environment manipulation features. While it does not contain explicit malware payloads, its capabilities for social media automation, spoofing, and self-updating mechanisms pose security risks if exploited maliciously. The overall malware score is moderate, and the obfuscation and risk levels are high, warranting caution.",
