      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The setup script shows signs of obfuscation and potential malicious intent due to nonsensical parameter names and invalid arguments. While no explicit malicious code is present, the suspicious structure warrants caution. The package should be reviewed further before use, and its distribution should be approached with suspicion."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign 'print' detection mechanism with obfuscated variables. While obfuscation and control flow could be used in malicious anti-debugging tactics, there is no direct evidence of malicious activity. The low malware and risk scores are appropriate. The pattern is suspicious but not malicious on its own."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code functions as a suspicious automation toolkit with high obfuscation and environment manipulation features. While it does not contain explicit malware payloads, its capabilities for social media automation, spoofing, and self-updating mechanisms pose security risks if exploited maliciously. The overall malware score is moderate, and the obfuscation and risk levels are high, warranting caution."
