  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate build configuration with obfuscated identifiers. While obfuscation is suspicious, there is no evidence of malicious activity or malware. The low malware score and moderate security risk are appropriate. Further review of the full package is recommended if additional context suggests malicious intent."
