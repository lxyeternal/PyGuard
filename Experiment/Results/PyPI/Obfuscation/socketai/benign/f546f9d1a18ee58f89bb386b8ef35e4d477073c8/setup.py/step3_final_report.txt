  "purpose": "Configure build parameters for a Windows-specific Python extension module, setting compiler flags and include directories.",
  "sources": "Import statements, get_include_dirs() function call, class and method definitions, extension sources and include_dirs",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks identified",
  "flows": "Class and method invoke build_ext with configuration parameters; extension sources and include_dirs are set during setup",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names, which are unusual and suspicious in build scripts",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for building a Windows-specific C++ extension with obfuscated identifiers. No malicious network activity, data exfiltration, or harmful system modifications are evident. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not demonstrate malicious intent. Malware scores are low, aligning with the absence of malicious behavior. Obfuscation scores are high, justified by the naming patterns. Security risk scores are moderate, mainly due to obfuscation, but no active threats are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate build configuration with obfuscated identifiers. While obfuscation is suspicious, there is no evidence of malicious activity or malware. The low malware score and moderate security risk are appropriate. Further review of the full package is recommended if additional context suggests malicious intent.",
