  "purpose": "Defines enum classes related to Wi-Fi Direct functionality, imported from Windows Runtime modules.",
  "sources": "Import statements from winrt modules; enum class definitions with obfuscated names.",
  "sinks": "No data flows, input/output, or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "flows": "None; static enum definitions without data or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and member names, suggesting code obfuscation or auto-generation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of enum class definitions with obfuscated identifiers, imported from Windows Runtime modules. No functions, data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present. The obfuscation may be due to code generation or internal naming conventions. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious patterns are detected. The malware score is 0, as there is no evidence of malicious behavior. The obfuscation score is high (~0.75), consistent with the obfuscated naming. The security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting the static, benign nature of the code. The code appears to serve as constants or configuration enums for Wi-Fi Direct features, with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting of obfuscated enum definitions for Wi-Fi Direct features, with no signs of malware or malicious activity. The obfuscation is likely due to code generation or internal naming conventions rather than malicious intent. The overall security risk is minimal.",
