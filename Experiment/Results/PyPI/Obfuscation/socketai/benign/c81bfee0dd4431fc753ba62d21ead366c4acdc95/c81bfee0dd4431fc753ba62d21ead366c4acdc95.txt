      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated cleanup utility used in setup processes. It performs standard filesystem deletions without any malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation appears cosmetic rather than malicious. The assigned scores in the reports are appropriate; the malware score remains at 0, the obfuscation score is justified around 0.75, and the security risk is low (~0.2). Overall, the code is safe and does not pose security concerns."

      "conclusion": "The code is a static analysis/transformation utility with obfuscated variable names and complex nested logic. No evidence of malicious activity or payloads is present. The obfuscation and dynamic code reconstruction capabilities could be misused if fed malicious input, but currently, it appears benign. The bug in exception handling should be fixed, but it does not impact security. Overall, the code poses low malware and security risk but warrants cautious monitoring due to obfuscation."

Overall, the supply chain risk is moderate, with high concern due to the malicious sample. Scores are consistent with the evidence, and no adjustments are necessary."
