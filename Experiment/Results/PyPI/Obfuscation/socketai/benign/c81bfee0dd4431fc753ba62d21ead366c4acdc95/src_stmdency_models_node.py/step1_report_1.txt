  "purpose": "Define a dataclass representing a CSTNode with an associated list of nodes, including hash and equality methods.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class attribute definitions, and method implementations within the dataclass.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or could cause harm.",
  "flows": "Data flows from class attributes to hash and equality methods, but no external or untrusted data sources are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The class and attribute names appear obfuscated, which could be intentional or suspicious. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code patterns are present. The code uses standard libraries and practices.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a data structure with custom hash and equality methods, relying on a third-party library 'libcst'. The obfuscated class and attribute names may indicate an attempt to hide purpose but do not inherently imply malicious intent. There are no network operations, data exfiltration, or suspicious behaviors observed. The code is syntactically valid and straightforward, with no signs of malware or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign data structure definition with obfuscated naming. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The obfuscation might be deliberate for privacy or concealment but does not indicate harmful intent.",
