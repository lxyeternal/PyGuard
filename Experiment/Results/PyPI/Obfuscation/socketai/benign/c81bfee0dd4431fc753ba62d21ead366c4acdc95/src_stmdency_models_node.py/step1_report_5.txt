{
  "purpose": "Define a dataclass representing a CSTNode with additional attributes and methods for equality and hashing.",
  "sources": "Import statements for annotations, dataclass, field, and libcst as cst.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; code does not process input/output or network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; code primarily defines a data structure.",
  "anomalies": "The class name and attribute names appear obfuscated or auto-generated, but no malicious behavior is evident. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a dataclass with a CSTNode, and a list of nodes of a custom type. The __hash__ and __eq__ methods enable usage in collections and comparisons. No code execution, data transmission, or suspicious activity detected. Obfuscation appears to be naming convention, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign data structure definition, likely part of a larger parsing or analysis tool using libcst. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
