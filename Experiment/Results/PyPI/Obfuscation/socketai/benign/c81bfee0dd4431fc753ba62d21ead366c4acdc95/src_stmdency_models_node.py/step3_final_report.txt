  "purpose": "Defines a data structure encapsulating a CST node and a list of 'StmdencyNode' objects, with custom hash and equality methods.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from the 'node' attribute of type 'cst.CSTNode' and the list 'lEvHGAyiMSAhOncRSHPxeYQblJjWZkaO'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows are present; the code does not process or output data externally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (attributes) through hash and equality methods; no external or network flow is observed.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and attribute names, which could be suspicious but are not inherently malicious; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward dataclass encapsulating a CST node and a list of nodes, with custom hash and equality methods. It uses obfuscated naming, which raises suspicion but does not indicate malicious intent. No external data processing, network activity, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code is syntactically correct and serves as a benign data structure. The obfuscation is consistent with potential concealment but does not imply malicious behavior. The malware score is appropriately set to 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated data structure with no malicious behavior or security risks. Obfuscation alone does not indicate malicious intent, and no external or harmful actions are present.",
