  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with minimal security risk; however, one report exhibits strong malicious indicators justifying high malware and obfuscation scores. Overall, the supply chain risk is moderate, with high concern due to the malicious sample. Scores are consistent with the evidence, and no adjustments are necessary."
