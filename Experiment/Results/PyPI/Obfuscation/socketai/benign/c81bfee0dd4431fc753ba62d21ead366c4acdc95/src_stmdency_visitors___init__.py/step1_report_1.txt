{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script intended to perform some data processing or utility functions. There is no clear indication of malicious intent or harmful operations.",
  "sources": "Reading input from environment variables, reading files, or receiving data through function parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writing data to files, printing output, or sending data over network connections.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or inputs into processing functions, then potentially to sinks like file writes or network calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscation, or hidden backdoors observed. Code uses standard library functions without unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, using common Python constructs. No malicious code segments, such as data exfiltration, network connections to suspicious domains, or malicious system modifications, are identified. No obfuscated code or obfuscation techniques are present. The code appears to be legitimate utility code or script, with no indicators of supply chain attack tactics.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign script with standard functionality. Confidence in this assessment is high, with a score of 0.9. No obfuscation or malware detected, security risk score is low at 0.1.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
