  "purpose": "Assign a version string to a variable, likely indicating the package or code version.",

  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "None",
  "anomalies": "The variable name appears obfuscated or nonsensical, which could be suspicious; however, no malicious behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single line assigning a string '0.0.5' to a variable with an obfuscated name 'WOJgjzevByqyrKzzfGgSHcrmITzIRGCR'. This does not perform any input, output, or potentially dangerous operation. The variable name's obfuscation could be an attempt to hide intent, but no malicious activity is visible in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple variable assignment of a version string with an obfuscated variable name. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
