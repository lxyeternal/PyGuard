  "purpose": "Define a custom 'clean' command for the setup process to remove build artifacts and cache directories.",
  "sources": "os.path.exists, os.path.isdir, os.remove, remove_tree, and self.ddNaDPGKCNvfHASzzCpMXImSCLlThfGC list.",
  "sinks": "os.remove, remove_tree, logging.info messages.",
  "flows": "Checks for existence of directories/files listed in self.ddNaDPGKCNvfHASzzCpMXImSCLlThfGC; if directories, removes them via remove_tree; if files, deletes with os.remove.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are obfuscated and nonsensical; no actual malicious code present. The code's only action is cleaning files/directories, which is standard in build scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries, sets up a logger, and defines a class that inherits from setuptools.Command. The class has methods that check for specific directories/files and remove them if they exist, logging each step. Variable names are deliberately obfuscated, but the logic is straightforward: clean build artifacts and cache. No external data sources, network activity, or malicious actions are present. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign custom clean command for a Python package setup, designed solely to remove build artifacts and cache directories. No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident.",
