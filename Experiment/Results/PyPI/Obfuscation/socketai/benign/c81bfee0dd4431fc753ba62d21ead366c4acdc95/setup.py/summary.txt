  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated cleanup utility used in setup processes. It performs standard filesystem deletions without any malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation appears cosmetic rather than malicious. The assigned scores in the reports are appropriate; the malware score remains at 0, the obfuscation score is justified around 0.75, and the security risk is low (~0.2). Overall, the code is safe and does not pose security concerns."
