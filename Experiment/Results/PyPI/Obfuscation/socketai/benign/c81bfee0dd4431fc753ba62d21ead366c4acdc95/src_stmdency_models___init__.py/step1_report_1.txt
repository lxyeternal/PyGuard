  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility function, but without the actual code content, this is speculative.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly identified due to lack of code content; typically could be user input, environment variables, or external files.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include network connections, file writes, or system commands, but specific sinks are not identifiable without the code.",
  "flows": "Data flow from sources to sinks cannot be determined without the code, so no source-to-sink paths are established.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies can be identified without code; there are no visible hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns in the provided snippet.",
  "analysis": "Insufficient information to perform a detailed step-by-step analysis; the code was not provided. As such, no source, sink, or flow analysis is possible. Cannot determine presence of malicious behavior or security issues without actual code content.",
  "conclusion": "Unable to analyze code due to lack of content. No evidence of malicious behavior or security risks can be identified without seeing the code. The code appears benign based on the absence of suspicious patterns in the provided prompt.",
