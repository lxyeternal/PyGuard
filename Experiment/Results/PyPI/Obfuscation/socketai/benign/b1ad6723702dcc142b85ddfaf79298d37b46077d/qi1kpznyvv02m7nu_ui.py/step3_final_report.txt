{
  "purpose": "A spectral visualization widget integrated with a map interface, initializing UI components and controls for spectral data display.",
  "sources": "Parameters such as host_map, stack, position, and obfuscated axis limit tuples; internal attribute assignments.",
  "sinks": "No external data transmission, network calls, or data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into attribute assignments; internal UI setup without external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names and nonsensical attribute descriptions; no malicious code or external dependencies observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a class constructor setting up a spectral visualization widget with map interaction controls. No network activity, file operations, or data exfiltration are present. Obfuscation of variable names raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. The code appears to be a standard UI component initialization, with scores reflecting low security risk and no malware detected. The obfuscation is moderate, possibly for proprietary reasons, but does not indicate malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is likely benign, serving as a UI widget for spectral data visualization. Despite obfuscated variable names, there is no evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The malware score remains at 0, with a moderate obfuscation score (~0.6), and a low security risk (~0.15). Continued monitoring is recommended if source trustworthiness is uncertain.",
