  "purpose": "Define a spectral widget for visualization on a map with controls and interaction handlers.",
  "sources": "Code reads input parameters such as host_map, stack, position, axis limits, and potentially user interaction functions.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or untrusted data handling observed; code appears to be setting up UI components and attributes.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are stored in object attributes; no data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks identified.",
  "anomalies": "The variable names include random, obfuscated-looking identifiers (e.g., jtAgWruqkRmqCJgTbhDxVmkyweJAmqiP). No sensitive data or hardcoded secrets are evident. The code appears to be standard UI component setup.",
  "analysis": "The code fragment sets up a class constructor for a spectral widget, initializing various UI components and attributes. There are no functions performing network operations, executing code dynamically, or handling untrusted input beyond parameter assignment. The variable names are inconsistent and include obfuscated strings, which could be suspicious but may also be a result of auto-generated code or obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, data exfiltration, or unsafe behavior. The overall structure and content suggest typical setup code for a visualization widget.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign setup for a spectral visualization widget, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscated variable names are unusual but do not inherently indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code is standard UI component initialization without any malicious activity.",
