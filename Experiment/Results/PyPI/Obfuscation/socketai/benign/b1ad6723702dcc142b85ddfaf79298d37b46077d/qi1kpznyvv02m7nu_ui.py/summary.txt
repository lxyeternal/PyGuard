  "conclusion": "The code is likely benign, serving as a UI widget for spectral data visualization. Despite obfuscated variable names, there is no evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The malware score remains at 0, with a moderate obfuscation score (~0.6), and a low security risk (~0.15). Continued monitoring is recommended if source trustworthiness is uncertain."
