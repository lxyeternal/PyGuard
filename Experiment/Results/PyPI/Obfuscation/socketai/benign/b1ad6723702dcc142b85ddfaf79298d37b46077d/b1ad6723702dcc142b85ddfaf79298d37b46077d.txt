      "conclusion": "The code is a benign script intended for documentation formatting, with a logical bug involving an undefined variable. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The obfuscation is superficial, and the security risk is very low. The main concern is fixing the bug to ensure correct execution."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is primarily scientific data processing with significant obfuscation. While no direct malicious activity is detected, the obfuscation and nonsensical function names suggest potential concealment. The malware score is estimated at 0.2, reflecting moderate suspicion due to obfuscation but no confirmed malicious payloads. The obfuscation score remains high (~0.7), and overall security risk is low (~0.2). Continuous monitoring and static analysis are recommended if used in sensitive environments."

      "confidence": 0.85,
      "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a heavily obfuscated but legitimate geospatial hyperspectral data processing routine. There is no evidence of malware, malicious sabotage, or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation warrants caution for maintainability but does not elevate the security threat. Overall, the code is safe but poorly documented and intentionally obscured, likely for proprietary reasons."

      "obfuscated": 0.2,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no active malicious behavior. The primary risk stems from the import statement from a local module, which could contain malicious code if compromised. The hardcoded personal data is sensitive but not malicious. Overall, the malware score is 0, obfuscation is low (around 0.2-0.3), and security risk is moderate (~0.2-0.3). Further review of the 'hypercoast' module is recommended before deployment."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, obfuscated ML pipeline for VAE training and evaluation, with no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. Obfuscation is likely for code protection rather than malicious purposes. The security risk is low, and the malware score should remain at 0."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate scientific data processing toolkit for EMIT satellite datasets. Despite obfuscated variable names, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation appears to be for proprietary or stylistic reasons rather than malicious intent. The security assessment indicates a safe, low-risk profile."

      "conclusion": "There is no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage in the code. The heavy obfuscation warrants caution and further static or dynamic analysis, but based on current information, the code appears to be legitimate satellite data processing routines. The malware score should be set to 0, the obfuscation score high (around 0.9), and the security risk low (around 0.2)."

Despite obfuscated variable names, there is no evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The malware score remains at 0, with a moderate obfuscation score (~0.6), and a low security risk (~0.15). Continued monitoring is recommended if source trustworthiness is uncertain."

The obfuscation warrants caution but does not constitute malicious intent. External links should be verified separately. Overall, the code is low risk."

The high obfuscation warrants caution, especially if inputs are untrusted, but current analysis does not identify active malware or malicious behavior."
