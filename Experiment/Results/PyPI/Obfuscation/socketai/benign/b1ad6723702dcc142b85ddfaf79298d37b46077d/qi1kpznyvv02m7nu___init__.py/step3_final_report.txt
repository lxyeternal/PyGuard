  "purpose": "Assigns personal info and version; imports all from local module 'hypercoast'.",
  "sources": "Variables with personal info and version; import statement from local module.",
  "sinks": "Potentially the imported 'hypercoast' module if it contains malicious code.",
  "flows": "Import from 'hypercoast' could execute code; no data flows or network activity observed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('*') from local module; presence of hardcoded personal data.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns static personal info and version data, which are not used further in this snippet. The import statement uses a wildcard, which can obscure imported code behavior and pose security risks if the module is compromised. No malicious commands, network activity, or obfuscation are evident. The variable names are nonsensical but not malicious. The main concern is the import practice and exposure of personal data, which warrants caution but does not demonstrate malicious intent in this isolated snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no active malicious behavior. The primary risk stems from the import statement from a local module, which could contain malicious code if compromised. The hardcoded personal data is sensitive but not malicious. Overall, the malware score is 0, obfuscation is low (around 0.2-0.3), and security risk is moderate (~0.2-0.3). Further review of the 'hypercoast' module is recommended before deployment.",
