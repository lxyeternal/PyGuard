  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no active malicious behavior. The primary risk stems from the import statement from a local module, which could contain malicious code if compromised. The hardcoded personal data is sensitive but not malicious. Overall, the malware score is 0, obfuscation is low (around 0.2-0.3), and security risk is moderate (~0.2-0.3). Further review of the 'hypercoast' module is recommended before deployment."
