  "conclusion": "The code is primarily scientific data processing with significant obfuscation. While no direct malicious activity is detected, the obfuscation and nonsensical function names suggest potential concealment. The malware score is estimated at 0.2, reflecting moderate suspicion due to obfuscation but no confirmed malicious payloads. The obfuscation score remains high (~0.7), and overall security risk is low (~0.2). Continuous monitoring and static analysis are recommended if used in sensitive environments."
