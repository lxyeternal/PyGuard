  "purpose": "Processing satellite and geophysical water data, including spectral analysis, clustering, PCA, and visualization.",
  "sources": "Dataset loading from files or parameters, reading spectral and geospatial data, interpolation, clustering, PCA, and plotting functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, network activity, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Data loaded -> processed (interpolated, clustered, PCA) -> visualized (maps, plots).",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with nonsensical variable and function names, suspicious function names like 'np.linalg.ITkbnjJhasCOcoodAYQaiQogAfTrWxsY', placeholder strings, inconsistent indentation, import statements inside functions, and placeholder comments.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard scientific data analysis routines with extensive obfuscation, which may be stylistic or an attempt to conceal malicious intent. No network or system-level malicious activity is evident. The obfuscation, especially in function names and variable identifiers, raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious behavior. The heavy obfuscation aligns with typical concealment tactics in malicious scripts, but the core logic appears legitimate for scientific processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily scientific data processing with significant obfuscation. While no direct malicious activity is detected, the obfuscation and nonsensical function names suggest potential concealment. The malware score is estimated at 0.2, reflecting moderate suspicion due to obfuscation but no confirmed malicious payloads. The obfuscation score remains high (~0.7), and overall security risk is low (~0.2). Continuous monitoring and static analysis are recommended if used in sensitive environments.",
