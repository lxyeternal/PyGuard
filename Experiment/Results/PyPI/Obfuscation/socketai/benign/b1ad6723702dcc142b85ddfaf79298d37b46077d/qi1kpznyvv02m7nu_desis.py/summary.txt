  "conclusion": "There is no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage in the code. The heavy obfuscation warrants caution and further static or dynamic analysis, but based on current information, the code appears to be legitimate satellite data processing routines. The malware score should be set to 0, the obfuscation score high (around 0.9), and the security risk low (around 0.2)."
