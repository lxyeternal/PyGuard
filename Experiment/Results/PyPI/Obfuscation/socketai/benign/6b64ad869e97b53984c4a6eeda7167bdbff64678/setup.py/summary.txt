  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup script with obfuscation in variable names but no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The low malware score (0) and moderate obfuscation score (~0.6) are appropriate. The security risk remains low (0.2), primarily due to reliance on environment variables, which is standard but warrants caution if environment integrity is compromised."
