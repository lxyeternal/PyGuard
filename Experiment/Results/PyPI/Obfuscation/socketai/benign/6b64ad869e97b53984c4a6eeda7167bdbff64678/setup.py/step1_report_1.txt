  "purpose": "The code configures the build setup for a Python extension module involving native C++ code, with optional external dependencies, and prepares package metadata.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'KYTEA_DIR', static file paths, and package directories.",
  "sinks": "os.environ.get (reads environment variables), sys.path.append (modifies module search path), setup() (initiates package setup).",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'KYTEA_DIR' -> appends include and lib paths; setup() uses collected extension modules and packages.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets or credentials, and no suspicious network activity. The code primarily deals with file paths and build configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, determines OS type, and sets dependency lists accordingly. It reads 'KYTEA_DIR' environment variable to optionally include external directories for build. It defines a C++ extension module with specific source files and includes, then appends relevant directories to sys.path. Package metadata and setup configurations are specified for building and testing the package. No dynamic code execution, code injection, or suspicious behaviors are observed. The code appears to be a standard build configuration script for a Python package involving native extensions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for building a Python extension module with optional external dependencies, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
