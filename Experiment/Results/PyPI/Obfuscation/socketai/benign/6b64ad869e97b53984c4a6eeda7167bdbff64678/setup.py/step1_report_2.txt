{
  "purpose": "Setup script for building and installing a Python package with C++ extension related to 'kytea'.",
  "sources": "os.environ.get('KYTEA_DIR'), reading package data, importing setuptools, sys.path modifications",
  "sinks": "Potentially adds paths to sys.path, calls setup() which could execute code if misused, but this is standard for setup scripts.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'KYTEA_DIR' influences include paths; setup() uses collected data to build package; no external data or untrusted inputs are executed or transmitted.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code such as network connections, data exfiltration, obfuscated code, or backdoors. Use of environment variables to modify include/lib paths is typical but could be misused if environment is malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up a C++ extension build environment, dynamically adjusting include and library paths based on environment variables. It imports standard modules, configures build parameters, and calls setup(). No obfuscated code or malicious patterns are evident. The only potential concern is reliance on 'KYTEA_DIR' environment variable, which could be manipulated but is standard practice for customizable builds.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a typical setup script for building a Python package with C++ extensions. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. It is a standard configuration with typical environment variable usage for paths. No security risks are identified beyond normal build process considerations.",
