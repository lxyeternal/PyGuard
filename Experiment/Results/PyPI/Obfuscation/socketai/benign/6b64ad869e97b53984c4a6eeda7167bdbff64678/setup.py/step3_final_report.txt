  "purpose": "Setup script for building a Python extension module with C++ sources, conditionally including external dependencies based on OS and environment variables.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable 'KYTEA_DIR' to determine include and library paths; defines extension modules and package configurations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection observed.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'KYTEA_DIR' influences include and library paths during extension setup; no malicious data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names (e.g., ZvKTilhffMNVatndFivKhmZldksSQYyK) suggest deliberate obfuscation but do not indicate malicious intent; no suspicious code patterns or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard build configuration script for a Python C++ extension, utilizing environment variables for optional external dependencies. Variable naming is obfuscated but consistent with deliberate obfuscation practices rather than malicious intent. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious code are present. The reliance on environment variables is typical but could be exploited if the environment is compromised. Overall, the script appears legitimate and typical for such build processes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup script with obfuscation in variable names but no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The low malware score (0) and moderate obfuscation score (~0.6) are appropriate. The security risk remains low (0.2), primarily due to reliance on environment variables, which is standard but warrants caution if environment integrity is compromised.",
