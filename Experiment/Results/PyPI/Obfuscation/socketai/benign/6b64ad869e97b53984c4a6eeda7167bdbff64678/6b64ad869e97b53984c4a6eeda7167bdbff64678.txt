      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup script with obfuscation in variable names but no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The low malware score (0) and moderate obfuscation score (~0.6) are appropriate. The security risk remains low (0.2), primarily due to reliance on environment variables, which is standard but warrants caution if environment integrity is compromised."

      "obfuscated": 0.1,
      "confidence": 0.85,
      "conclusion": "The analysis confirms that the primary security concern is the command execution in Report 1, which justifies high malware and risk scores. Other reports, lacking concrete code, are reasonably scored low. The overall assessment indicates a moderate to high risk primarily driven by potential command injection vulnerabilities, with some suspicion of obfuscation or network activity in other contexts. Continuous monitoring and further code review are recommended."
