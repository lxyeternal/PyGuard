{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script designed for data processing or application logic. Its purpose is not explicitly stated but seems to involve typical operations without malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly visible; the code does not read from external inputs, files, or network sources directly.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include standard output or data storage functions, but no untrusted data flows or sensitive data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "There are no clear source-to-sink data flows; the code executes internal computations without external data dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hard-coded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic code execution are observed. The code structure appears straightforward and conventional.",
  "analysis": "The script contains standard Python functions and data manipulations, with no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, system modification, or data exfiltration. It lacks external input handling or insecure code patterns. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are detected. The overall behavior aligns with typical application code.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears safe and free from supply chain threats or malware, with a high confidence level.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
