  "conclusion": "The analysis confirms that the primary security concern is the command execution in Report 1, which justifies high malware and risk scores. Other reports, lacking concrete code, are reasonably scored low. The overall assessment indicates a moderate to high risk primarily driven by potential command injection vulnerabilities, with some suspicion of obfuscation or network activity in other contexts. Continuous monitoring and further code review are recommended."
