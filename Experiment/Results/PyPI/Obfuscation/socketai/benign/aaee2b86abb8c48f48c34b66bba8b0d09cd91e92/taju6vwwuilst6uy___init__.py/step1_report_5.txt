  "purpose": "Import all components from the 'openedx_filters.filters' module and define a version string variable.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing everything from 'openedx_filters.filters'.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no data flows to external systems, no untrusted input handling or output.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a seemingly random or obfuscated variable name 'SdMgzmscHjKUrkTZQlPxvlwVdHIuTTxS' assigned a version string. The variable name appears intentionally obscure or auto-generated, which may suggest obfuscation or concealment.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a standard import statement and a single variable assignment. The import statement imports everything from a specific module, which in itself is not suspicious, though using 'import *' can hide imported components and make the code harder to analyze. The variable name assigned a version string appears deliberately obfuscated or nonsensical, potentially to hide its purpose or to avoid detection. No suspicious network activity, credential handling, or malicious commands are present. The code does not perform any operations beyond importing and defining a variable.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal and straightforward but includes an obfuscated variable name, which could be an attempt to conceal its purpose. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks based solely on this fragment. The overall risk is low, but the obfuscated variable name warrants a cautious note.",
