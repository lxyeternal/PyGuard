  "purpose": "Import all symbols from the openedx_filters.filters module and define a version string.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing from openedx_filters.filters",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is used or could cause leaks",
  "flows": "No significant data flow from sources to sinks; import statement is static and harmless",
  "anomalies": "The import statement is typical; the variable name 'SdMgzmscHjKUrkTZQlPxvlwVdHIuTTxS' appears obfuscated or randomly generated, which could be suspicious but is not inherently malicious. The version string is simple and unencrypted.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module with a wildcard import, which could potentially hide malicious or unintended symbols, but this pattern alone is common in some packages. The variable with a long, nonsensical name assigned to a version string does not perform any action or network operation. There are no signs of code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious activity. Overall, the code is minimal and does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. The only concern is the obfuscated variable name, which could be part of code obfuscation or malicious intent, but on its own, it does not indicate malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a basic import and assigns a version string to a obfuscated variable name. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks based on this fragment. The overall security risk is very low.",
