  "purpose": "Import all symbols from 'openedx_filters.filters' and assign a version string to an obfuscated variable.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'openedx_filters.filters'; assignment of version string to obfuscated variable.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "Import provides symbols; variable assignment is standalone with no further data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable name 'SdMgzmscHjKUrkTZQlPxvlwVdHIuTTxS'; no other anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code imports all symbols from a module, which is standard but can be risky if the module is malicious. The variable name appears obfuscated, which could be an attempt to hide intent but is not inherently malicious. The assigned version string is benign. No code execution, network activity, or data leakage is evident. The minimal code and lack of malicious patterns suggest benign intent, though obfuscation warrants cautious review. Scores reflect low risk and no malicious activity, with the obfuscation noted but not overemphasized.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious behavior. Obfuscation is present but not sufficient to classify as malicious. Scores are consistent with the analysis; no further action needed based on this fragment.",
