  "purpose": "Import all filters from the openedx_filters.filters module and define a version string",
  "sources": "The import statement from openedx_filters.filters, and the assignment of a version string",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; no data flows to external systems or untrusted outputs",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; import and assignment are benign",
  "anomalies": "The variable name 'SdMgzmscHjKUrkTZQlPxvlwVdHIuTTxS' is unusual and appears obfuscated, which can be suspicious. The import statement is straightforward, but the random variable name may suggest obfuscation or hiding intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module and assigns a string to an obfuscated variable name. No suspicious functions, data transmission, or malicious behavior are evident. The import is standard, and the version string is benign. The unusual variable name raises suspicion of obfuscation, but there is no evidence of malicious actions. Overall, the code appears benign but uses obfuscated naming possibly to hide intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and does not demonstrate malicious behavior; however, the obfuscated variable name could indicate intent to hide or obfuscate, warranting cautious review in context.",
