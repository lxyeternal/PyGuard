  "purpose": "A unit test that instantiates an exception class with an obfuscated name, sets a 'custom_arg' attribute, and verifies its value.",
  "sources": "Instantiation of the exception class and setting of the 'custom_arg' attribute.",
  "sinks": "Assertion checking the 'custom_arg' attribute value.",
  "flows": "Object creation -> attribute assignment -> assertion check.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and exception names; no external data or network activity; simple attribute check.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Django unit test that creates an instance of an exception class with obfuscated naming, assigns a 'custom_arg' attribute, and asserts its value. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not indicate malicious intent. No external data handling, network activity, or malicious behaviors are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0.75-0.8, securityRisk=0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The obfuscation warrants cautious review but does not constitute a security threat in isolation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, obfuscated unit test with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation is notable but not sufficient to raise the overall risk score significantly. The current scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary based on this snippet.",
