  "purpose": "Unit test for the 'PPRUmHsDoGFWBHBBxylijGzMheNYLQtR' exception class from 'openedx_filters.exceptions'.",
  "sources": "Instantiation of 'PPRUmHsDoGFWBHBBxylijGzMheNYLQtR' with a 'custom_arg' parameter.",
  "sinks": "Access to 'custom_arg' attribute of the instantiated exception object.",
  "flows": "Object creation -> Attribute access of 'custom_arg'.",
  "anomalies": "The class name and variable names are obfuscated, but this is typical for obfuscated code rather than malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials, no network calls, no data leaks, or suspicious behaviors are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific exception class and creates a test case. The test case instantiates an object of the exception class with a custom argument, then verifies that the attribute is correctly set. All operations are standard unit testing practices. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or system manipulation. The obfuscated variable and class names suggest code obfuscation but do not necessarily imply malicious intent. The code is straightforward and performs a simple attribute check.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign unit test for a custom exception class. There are no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or supply chain attacks. The obfuscation appears intentional but harmless. Overall, the code appears safe.",
