  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be a Python script designed for data processing or utility functions, possibly part of a larger application.",
  "sources": "Input data may be read from environment variables, user input prompts, or external files (though no specific source is explicitly shown in the snippet).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, file operations, or system commands, but none are explicitly present in the provided code fragment.",
  "flows": "No clear source-to-sink data flow is observable within this code snippet; it primarily performs basic data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are detected. The code contains straightforward function definitions and standard library usage. No obfuscated or unusual language features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a benign Python script performing simple data handling tasks. It uses standard syntax, functions, and control flow. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code injection. Without additional context or external interactions, it does not seem to have any security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code fragment, there are no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The code appears safe and standard in its operations.",
