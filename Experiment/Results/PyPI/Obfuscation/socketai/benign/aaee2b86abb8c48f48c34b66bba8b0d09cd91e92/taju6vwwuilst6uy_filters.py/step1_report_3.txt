  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for pipeline steps with logging and an abstract method to be implemented by subclasses.",
  "sources": "Input parameters in the __init__ method (kwBJcToltvwMHfplHrKSyaSdyYLVzltB, running_pipeline, **QNBrBeOCsBnywWAqvVplSwSlavGraDYd).",
  "sinks": "The warning message in the xZzUoTqGFyTdXqUbZKyJEdtYWTawQyaS method (logs to logger).",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into object attributes; the abstract method logs a warning if not overridden.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names and a warning message about unimplemented method. No dynamic code execution or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class with an init method storing parameters, and an abstract method with a warning log if not overridden. The obfuscated variable names are suspicious but not inherently malicious. No user input handling, network calls, or dangerous operations are present. The code mainly sets up a class structure for subclasses to implement specific logic, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign abstract class definition intended for pipeline step implementation. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. Obfuscated variable names are suspicious but do not indicate malicious intent directly.",
