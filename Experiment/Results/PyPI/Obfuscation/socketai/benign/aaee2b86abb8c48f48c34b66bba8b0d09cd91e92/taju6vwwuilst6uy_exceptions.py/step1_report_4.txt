  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class with flexible attributes for error handling.",
  "sources": "Input data through the **CoJIVLLHnfFjiNfsCbgYBuuILATKNznk dictionary parameter during initialization.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks that process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "Data from the **CoJIVLLHnfFjiNfsCbgYBuuILATKNznk dictionary flows into object attributes via setattr.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated variable names; dynamic attribute setting with **kwargs; no validation of input data; no external calls or I/O operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of Exception with additional parameters and dynamic attribute assignment. No external input or output, network activity, or file operations are present. The obfuscated variable names are suspicious but do not necessarily indicate malicious intent. The dynamic attribute setting from kwargs could be misused if malicious data is injected, but there is no evidence of malicious actions like network calls or data theft. Overall, the code appears to be a standard custom exception class with obfuscated naming and no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code defines a custom exception class with dynamic attribute assignment and obfuscated variable names. There is no clear evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks based solely on this snippet. The obfuscation might hinder code review but does not indicate malicious activity.",
