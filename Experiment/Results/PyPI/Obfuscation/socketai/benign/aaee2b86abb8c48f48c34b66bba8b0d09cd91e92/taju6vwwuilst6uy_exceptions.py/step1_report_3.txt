  "purpose": "Custom exception class for handling specific error conditions with optional redirection and additional attributes.",
  "sources": "Input data from **CoJIVLLHnfFjiNfsCbgYBuuILATKNznk (additional keyword arguments).",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data assigned to instance attributes via setattr, especially 'redirect_to'.",
  "flows": "Keyword arguments -> setattr within the constructor; message attribute used in __str__ method.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; no clear malicious intent or backdoors; no suspicious network activity or code injection.",
  "analysis": "The class defines a custom exception with flexible attributes via keyword arguments. The use of obfuscated variable names is likely an attempt at code concealment but does not inherently indicate malicious intent. The class only assigns passed-in data to attributes and returns a message string. No external data sources, network operations, or system modifications are present. The 'redirect_to' attribute could potentially be used to store a URL, but in this code, it is simply set from input. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward custom exception class with obfuscated variable names. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
