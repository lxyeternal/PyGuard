  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class with optional attributes and dynamic attribute setting.",
  "sources": "The class constructor reads optional parameters including message, redirect_to, status_code, and additional keyword arguments.",
  "sinks": "The code sets attributes dynamically on the exception instance, which could potentially be exploited if malicious data is passed via keyword arguments.",
  "flows": "Input data (keyword arguments) -> dynamic attribute setting in __init__ -> exception object with arbitrary attributes",
  "anomalies": "Use of **kwargs to set arbitrary attributes without validation; no apparent validation or sanitization of input data; no external data sources or network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class inheriting from Exception. It initializes with optional parameters, including message, redirect URL, status code, and any additional keyword arguments, which are set as attributes dynamically. No external data sources, network operations, or code execution are present. The dynamic setting of attributes could pose a risk if malicious data is passed, but on its own, it is a common pattern. There are no signs of obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The class appears to be a standard custom exception implementation with flexible attribute assignment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward custom exception class with dynamic attribute assignment. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The use of **kwargs for setting attributes could be exploited if malicious data is supplied, but this is a common pattern in Python and not inherently malicious.",
