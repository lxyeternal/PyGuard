{
  "purpose": "Custom exception class for error handling with optional redirection and additional attributes.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from optional keyword arguments in the constructor (__init__). No external or untrusted sources are explicitly read in this code.",
  "sinks": "Attributes are set dynamically from provided keyword arguments, but these are stored as object attributes, not directly exposed or transmitted in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Input data (kwargs) flows into attribute assignment within the constructor; no external data flows or network communications are observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are evident. The class merely extends Exception and allows dynamic attribute setting.",
  "analysis": "The class defines a custom exception with flexible attribute setting via keyword arguments, which is a common pattern for error objects. No input sanitization or validation occurs, but this alone does not indicate malicious intent. No external data is read, and no code injection, network activity, or data leaks are present. The code appears straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a standard custom exception class with dynamic attribute assignment. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The use of dynamic attribute setting is normal in Python for such purposes. Overall, it is safe and typical for exception handling.",
