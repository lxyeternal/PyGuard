  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class with flexible attributes, obfuscated variable names, and optional kwargs for dynamic attribute assignment.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: message, redirect_to, status_code, and arbitrary kwargs; no external data sources.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic attribute setting from kwargs; no direct data leaks or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are assigned to object attributes; no external data flow or malicious code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated variable names; dynamic attribute assignment without validation; no input sanitization.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard pattern for a flexible exception class, with obfuscation and dynamic attribute setting. No network, file, or code injection activities are present. The obfuscation hinders readability but does not imply malicious intent. The dynamic kwargs could be misused if malicious data is passed, but the class itself does not process or execute such data. Scores from reports are consistent: malware=0, obfuscation high (~0.8), risk low (~0.2). The main concern is obfuscation and potential misuse of kwargs, but no actual malicious activity is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, flexible custom exception class with obfuscated variable names. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. The high obfuscation warrants caution but is not indicative of malicious intent. Overall, the security risk is minimal, and the code is safe in isolation.",
