  "purpose": "Filter specific keys from a Django QueryDict based on a predefined list and return the removed key-value pairs.",
  "sources": "Input QueryDict object passed to the method.",
  "sinks": "The method modifies the original QueryDict by popping keys; potential data modification points.",
  "flows": "Iterates over items in the copied QueryDict; if key in exclusion list, pops from original and adds to result.",
  "anomalies": "The exclusion list is empty, so the filtering condition is never true; the method always returns an empty dict.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with an empty list intended for filtering keys. The method copies the input QueryDict, iterates over its items, and removes keys present in the list from the original, returning these as a dict. Since the list is empty, no keys are ever removed, making the function effectively a no-op. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The code is straightforward but flawed in logic due to the empty filter list, which renders it ineffective. The reports are empty, providing no additional context or issues. The code does not pose security risks or malicious behavior; it is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign key-filtering utility that currently does not filter any keys due to an empty list. No malicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident. The lack of detailed reports prevents further analysis, but based on the code alone, the security risk is minimal.",
