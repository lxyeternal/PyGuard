{
  "purpose": "This code is a benign data processing script that reads input from sources such as files or environment variables, processes data, and outputs results. There are no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "sources": "File reads, environment variables, user input, data streams",
  "sinks": "File writes, network transmissions, environment variable modifications, output streams",
  "flows": "Sources (file/env/input) → data processing functions → sinks (file/network/output)",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no suspicious network activity",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data handling operations without any malicious commands or obfuscation. It reads data from typical sources, processes it in a straightforward manner, and outputs results. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or malicious network connections are present. The absence of obfuscation and malicious indicators suggests a low security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation detected. It represents a typical utility script with low security risk.",
