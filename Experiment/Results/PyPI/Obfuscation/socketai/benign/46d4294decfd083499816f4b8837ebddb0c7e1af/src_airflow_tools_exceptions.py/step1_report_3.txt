  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class for handling unexpected API response types.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data could lead to leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths within this code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The class name appears to be intentionally obfuscated or randomly generated, which is unusual and could indicate malicious intent or obfuscation. The class contains only a docstring and pass statement with no additional code or behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single, obfuscated class definition inheriting from Exception, intended to signal a specific error condition. The class name appears deliberately obscure, which could be an attempt at obfuscation. The class does not contain any methods, data, or code that perform actions. The lack of code does not inherently suggest malicious activity but the obfuscated naming raises suspicion of possible concealment or malicious obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself is minimal and syntactically valid, serving as a custom exception. The obfuscated class name is suspicious and could be an attempt at hiding malicious intent or simply obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or malware in this fragment. Overall, the code poses low risk, but the naming warrants caution if found in a larger context.",
