  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling unexpected API response types.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists in this minimal class definition.",
  "anomalies": "The class name is highly obfuscated with nonsensical, randomly generated characters, which is unusual and suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a single custom exception class with an obscure, nonsensical name, and a docstring explaining its purpose. There are no data inputs, network operations, or other behavior. The obfuscated class name suggests possible code hiding or malicious intent, but with no additional code or context, it is difficult to determine malicious behavior solely from this snippet. The structure itself is minimal and syntactically valid, but the name choice is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign exception class in structure; however, the highly obfuscated class name raises suspicion. It could be part of a larger obfuscated codebase or malicious module, but on its own, it shows no malicious actions or data leaks.",
