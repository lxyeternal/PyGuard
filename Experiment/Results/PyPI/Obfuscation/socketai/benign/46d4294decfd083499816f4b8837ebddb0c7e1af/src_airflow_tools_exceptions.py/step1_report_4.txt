  "purpose": "Define a custom exception for handling unexpected API response types.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reads are present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths exist in this minimal code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The class name appears to be a nonsensical, randomly generated string, which may suggest obfuscation or lack of meaningful naming. The code only contains a class definition with a docstring and no other logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single custom exception class inheriting from Exception, used for signaling unexpected response types from an API. There are no functions, data processing, external input, or network interactions. The class name is a long, nonsensical string, which could indicate obfuscation or generated code. No malicious patterns, such as data exfiltration, network activity, or code injection, are present. The code is very minimal and does not perform any operations beyond defining a class.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, benign class definition intended for error handling. There are no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The unusual class name does not, by itself, imply malicious activity but might suggest obfuscation or generated code. Overall, the code appears safe.",
