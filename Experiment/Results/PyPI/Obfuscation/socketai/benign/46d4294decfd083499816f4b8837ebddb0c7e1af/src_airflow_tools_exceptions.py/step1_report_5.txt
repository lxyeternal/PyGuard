  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling unexpected API response types.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations; only class definition.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow pathways; the code solely defines a class.",
  "anomalies": "The class name and exception message are unusually verbose and obfuscated, with no clear purpose or context. No dynamic or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single class definition inheriting from Exception, intended to signal a specific error condition related to API response types. There are no inputs, outputs, or external interactions. The class name and docstring are complex but do not indicate malicious intent. No suspicious code constructs, data leaks, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code defines a custom exception class with an unusually complex name but contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign component of a larger codebase.",
