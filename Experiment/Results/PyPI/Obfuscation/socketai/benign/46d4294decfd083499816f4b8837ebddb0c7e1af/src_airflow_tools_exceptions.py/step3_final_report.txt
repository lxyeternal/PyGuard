  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling unexpected API response types.",
  "sources": "Class name `vTlbFotzzTcXezHvZbGHOmxMCfVuwmHN` (used as an exception), no external data sources or inputs.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external interactions; class only defines an exception type.",
  "flows": "No data flow; class is a static exception definition with no runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated class name, which is unusual and suspicious; contains only a docstring and pass statement.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a minimal class inheriting from Exception with an obfuscated name, no data flows, inputs, or external interactions. The obfuscated name raises suspicion but the class itself is benign, serving solely as a custom exception. No malicious behavior, network activity, or data leakage is present. The obfuscation score is justified due to the nonsensical class name, but the malware and security risk scores are low, consistent with the absence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign but the obfuscated class name warrants caution. It does not contain malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The high obfuscation score is justified, and overall risk remains low. Monitoring in the broader code context is recommended, but the snippet itself is safe.",
