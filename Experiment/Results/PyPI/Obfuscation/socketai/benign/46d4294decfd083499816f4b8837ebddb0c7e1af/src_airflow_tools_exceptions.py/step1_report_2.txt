  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling unexpected API response types.",
  "sources": "Class definition in the code (no input sources or external data reading).",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted data or external effects are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines an exception class.",
  "anomalies": "Class name appears to be obfuscated or intentionally nonsensical, which could suggest obfuscation or malicious intent; no other unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single custom exception class inheriting from Exception, with a verbose, seemingly nonsensical name. There are no functions, data processing, or external interactions. The class is likely intended for use elsewhere to signal specific API response errors. The unusual class name could be an obfuscation attempt, but on its own, the code does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward class definition for a custom exception. Despite the peculiar class name, there is no malicious intent or security risk identified. The code appears to be benign but potentially obfuscated in naming.",
