  "purpose": "Provides static metadata about the airflow-tools package, including version info and connection types.",
  "sources": "Imports obfuscated attribute 'nPcLBofDBEMlUulSdtmdbcgtEXCFfJeS' from airflow_tools._version.",
  "sinks": "None; static data returned without external data sinks.",
  "flows": "Import of obfuscated version attribute to the return dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "Use of an obfuscated, nonsensical attribute name for version info.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a single obfuscated attribute and returns static package metadata. No dynamic inputs, network activity, or code execution are present. The obfuscated variable name suggests possible concealment but does not indicate malicious intent. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, code injection, or external communication are evident. The code is straightforward and benign, serving as a static metadata provider. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not constitute malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, merely returning static package metadata with an obfuscated version attribute. No evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation is suspicious but not malicious; overall, the security risk is minimal.",
