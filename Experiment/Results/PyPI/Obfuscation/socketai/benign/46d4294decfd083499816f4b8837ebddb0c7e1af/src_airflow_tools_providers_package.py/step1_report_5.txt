{
  "purpose": "Defines a function that returns metadata about the airflow-tools package, including its name, description, version, and connection types.",
  "sources": "The function reads a version identifier imported from airflow_tools._version.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "The version variable is accessed from the imported module and included in the returned dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "The variable nPcLBofDBEMlUulSdtmdbcgtEXCFfJeS appears to be an obfuscated or nonsensical name, which might indicate obfuscation or attempt to hide the value. No actual malicious behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a potentially obfuscated variable from a local module and returns static package metadata, including connection types with class names. There are no evident external inputs, no data flow to external systems, and no malicious code or behavior. The obfuscated variable name is suspicious but not malicious per se.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward metadata provider with an obfuscated variable name. There is no evidence of malicious intent or malware. It simply returns package information, and no security risks are detected.",
