{
  "purpose": "Defines a function returning metadata about the airflow-tools package, including version info and connection types.",
  "sources": "The function reads a module attribute 'nPcLBofDBEMlUulSdtmdbcgtEXCFfJeS' for version info.",
  "sinks": "No external data or untrusted input sources are present; no sinks for data leaks or command execution.",
  "flows": "The data flows from the imported module attribute into the returned dictionary structure.",
  "anomalies": "The imported attribute 'nPcLBofDBEMlUulSdtmdbcgtEXCFfJeS' appears obfuscated or non-descriptive, possibly hiding version details.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a single attribute with an obscure name, then defines a function that returns static metadata, including this attribute as version info. No user input, environment variables, or network operations are present. The obscure attribute name might suggest an attempt to hide or obfuscate version info, but no malicious behavior is evident. The structure is straightforward and does not include any code execution, data leakage, or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple metadata provider with an obfuscated attribute name for version info. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The use of an obscure attribute name warrants caution but does not constitute malicious intent.",
