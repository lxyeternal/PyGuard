{
  "purpose": "Define a function that returns metadata about the airflow-tools package, including version and connection types.",
  "sources": "The code reads the version value from the imported symbol 'nPcLBofDBEMlUulSdtmdbcgtEXCFfJeS'.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or untrusted data outputs are present. No network, file, or environment interactions are detected.",
  "flows": "The only data flow is from the imported version symbol to the return dictionary, with no external influence or untrusted input handling.",
  "anomalies": "The imported symbol 'nPcLBofDBEMlUulSdtmdbcgtEXCFfJeS' appears to be a nonsensical, obfuscated string, which could suggest deliberate obfuscation or concealment. No other suspicious or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a seemingly obfuscated or nonsensical variable and uses it as the package version. The function simply returns static metadata about the package and its connection types. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leakage, or insecure coding practices. The obfuscated import may raise suspicion but does not directly suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign; it simply returns package metadata with an obfuscated version string. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscated import warrants mild suspicion but is not malicious.",
