{
  "purpose": "Define a function that returns metadata about the airflow-tools package, including its name, description, versions, connection types, and extra links.",
  "sources": "The code reads an imported variable 'nPcLBofDBEMlUulSdtmdbcgtEXCFfJeS' for the version number.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external output points that could lead to data leaks or malicious activity.",
  "flows": "The version variable is imported and used directly in the return statement; no other data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "The imported variable 'nPcLBofDBEMlUulSdtmdbcgtEXCFfJeS' appears obfuscated or non-descriptive, which could indicate obfuscation or an attempt to hide its purpose. The rest of the code is straightforward, defining static data.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a single variable with an obfuscated name, likely containing version information. It then defines a function that returns package metadata, including this version. There are no inputs, no dynamic data manipulation, and no external connections or commands executed. The obfuscated import suggests possible concealment, but it does not directly perform malicious actions. The static return data appears to describe the package details. Overall, no malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward package metadata provider, with an obfuscated import that may be intended to conceal the version source. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The obfuscation is suspicious but not necessarily malicious.",
