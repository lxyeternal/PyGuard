  "purpose": "Define and return metadata about the 'airflow-tools' package, including version info and connection types.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'nPcLBofDBEMlUulSdtmdbcgtEXCFfJeS'; usage of 'nPcLBofDBEMlUulSdtmdbcgtEXCFfJeS' in the return statement.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leakage, code execution, or external communication present.",
  "flows": "Import of version variable -> inclusion in returned dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "Use of an obfuscated-looking variable name 'nPcLBofDBEMlUulSdtmdbcgtEXCFfJeS'; no other suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that returns package metadata, including version info stored in an obfuscated variable. No input/output, no network activity, no suspicious logic or data handling. The obfuscated variable name may suggest an attempt to hide the version value, but without malicious context, this alone is not malicious. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward metadata provider with obfuscated variable naming. There is no malicious intent or security risk detected based on this snippet.",
