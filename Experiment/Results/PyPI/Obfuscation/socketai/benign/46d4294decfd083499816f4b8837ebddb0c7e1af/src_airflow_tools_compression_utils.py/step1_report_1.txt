{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for compressing and decompressing data using gzip and zip formats, likely for data storage or transfer.",
  "sources": "Input data is received via function parameters; no direct external input sources like network or file reads are present.",
  "sinks": "Compressed or decompressed data is returned by functions, potentially for further use or storage.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into compression/decompression functions, then returns the processed data. No external or untrusted sources are explicitly read or written within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. Function names are obfuscated but follow standard compression/decompression routines. No unusual code constructs or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements straightforward compression and decompression routines using standard Python libraries gzip and zipfile. It handles data in-memory via BytesIO objects. No input validation or security checks are performed on data, but since all data is handled locally and in-memory, the risk of injection or data leakage is minimal. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, system modification, or command execution. Function names are obfuscated, but their purposes align with common data compression tasks. No hardcoded secrets or external communication mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard compression and decompression operations without any signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a utility module for handling data compression formats securely in isolation.",
