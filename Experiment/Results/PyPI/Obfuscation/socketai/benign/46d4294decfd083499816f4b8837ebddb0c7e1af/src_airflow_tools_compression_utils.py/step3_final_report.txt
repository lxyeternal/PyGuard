  "purpose": "Utility functions for compressing and decompressing data using gzip and zip formats, handling data entirely in-memory.",
  "sources": "Function parameters providing data bytes; in-memory BytesIO streams.",
  "sinks": "In-memory BytesIO streams where compressed or decompressed data is written or read.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input bytes to in-memory streams, through compression/decompression functions, and back to output bytes.",
  "anomalies": "Moderate obfuscation in variable and function names; presence of a hardcoded filename 'file.zip' as default parameter.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard Python libraries for compression/decompression with in-memory streams, with no external I/O or network activity. No signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. Obfuscation is superficial, primarily in naming. The hardcoded filename 'file.zip' is a minor concern but not malicious. All functions perform straightforward utility tasks. No secrets or external dependencies are involved.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for in-memory compression and decompression. No malicious intent or malicious code is present. The obfuscation is superficial and does not indicate malicious activity. The overall security risk is minimal, and the malware score should remain at 0.",
