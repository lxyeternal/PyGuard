{
  "purpose": "Provides functions for compressing and decompressing data using gzip and zip formats.",
  "sources": "Input data is provided to functions as bytes parameters; no external data sources are read directly within the functions.",
  "sinks": "Returns compressed or decompressed bytes; no direct data leaks or external outputs are evident.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into compression functions and outputs compressed or decompressed data; no external network or system modification occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. The code uses standard libraries and functions. Variable names are obfuscated but do not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns found.",
  "analysis": "The code implements basic compression/decompression routines using standard Python libraries (gzip, zipfile). Functions accept data as bytes and return processed data as bytes. No external inputs like environment variables or network connections are used. No suspicious patterns, code injections, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code appears straightforward, primarily for data compression purposes, with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of compression and decompression utilities with no signs of malware or malicious intent. It solely performs data compression tasks using standard libraries and does not engage in any suspicious activities.",
