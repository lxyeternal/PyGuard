{
  "purpose": "To evaluate supply chain security risks in the open source dependency by analyzing code behaviors, identifying malicious indicators, and scoring potential threats.",
  "sources": "eval()/exec() functions, hardcoded URLs/credentials, network activity, obfuscated variable names, complex control flow, environment variable usage.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, data exfiltration points, external servers, system commands, environment variables.",
  "flows": "Sources such as eval() or network calls lead to potential malicious actions or data leaks, especially when combined with obfuscated code or hardcoded secrets.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval()/exec() on untrusted data, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated variable names, complex control flow, suspicious network activity, inconsistent confidence levels, and code structure that suggests obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits patterns like eval()/exec() usage, obfuscated variables, and network activity, which are typical red flags for malicious behavior. Reports 1 and 3 highlight these issues with higher suspicion, warranting increased malware scores (from 0.45 to 0.6 for report 1, and from 0.3 to 0.6 for report 3). Reports 2 and 4 show benign characteristics with no suspicious activity, justifying low scores. Report 5 shows obfuscation but lacks concrete malicious indicators. Adjustments to scores reflect these observations, emphasizing the importance of actual code review for confirmation.",
  "conclusion": "Most reports align with their scores, but Reports 1 and 3 should have higher malware scores due to suspicious patterns. Overall, the dependency exhibits moderate risk with some obfuscation and potential malicious indicators, warranting cautious use and further analysis.",
