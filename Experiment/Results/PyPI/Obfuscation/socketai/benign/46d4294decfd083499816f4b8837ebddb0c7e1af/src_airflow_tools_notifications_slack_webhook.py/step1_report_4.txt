{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to generate and send Slack notifications related to Airflow DAGs and task failures, including links to logs and optional images.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (AIRFLOW_TOOLS__SLACK_NOTIFICATION_IMG_URL), configuration data from airflow.conf, function parameters (e.g., run_id, dag_id, task_id, execution_date, queued_at).",
  "sinks": "send_slack_webhook_notification function call, which sends data to an external Slack webhook URL; URLs constructed for logs and notifications; environment variable usage for image URL.",
  "flows": "Source data (env variables, config, parameters) flows into notification message composition, which then flows into the send_slack_webhook_notification call that sends data externally.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic URL construction with templating placeholders; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no evidence of code injection or obfuscated code; environment variables are used but are typical for configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs Slack notification messages for Airflow failures, using configuration and environment variables. It dynamically generates URLs to logs and includes optional images. No suspicious or malicious logic such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors is present. The use of templating for URLs and notification content aligns with typical notification systems. Environment variables are used for configuration but not for secret extraction. The functions primarily prepare and send notifications. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard notification module for Airflow failure alerts with no malicious intent. It constructs messages and URLs for Slack notifications, with configurable options. There are no signs of malware or security risks.",
