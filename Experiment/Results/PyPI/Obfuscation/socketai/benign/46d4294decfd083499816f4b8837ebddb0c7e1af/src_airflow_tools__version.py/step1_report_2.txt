  "purpose": "Assignment of a version string to a variable",
  "sources": "Assignment statement setting a variable to a string value",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; simple assignment",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable name that appears obfuscated, but no active malicious code or behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a string '0.12.0' to a variable with a seemingly random name. No input reading, no data processing, no external communication, and no suspicious constructs are present. The variable name does not match typical patterns and might be obfuscated, but without further context, it appears benign. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malware. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple variable assignment with an obfuscated variable name. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks based solely on this snippet.",
