  "purpose": "Assign a version string to a variable, likely indicating the version of a package or module.",
  "sources": "Assignment statement setting a string value to a variable",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external outputs",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "Variable name appears to be a random string rather than a meaningful identifier, which could indicate obfuscation or malicious intent. No other code present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a variable assignment with a seemingly random variable name and a version string. There are no functions, imports, network calls, or other operations. The variable name does not correspond to standard naming conventions and appears to be obfuscated or deliberately obscure. The value is a straightforward version number string. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activities are detected based on this isolated line.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple, benign variable assignment of a version string with an obfuscated variable name. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks in this fragment.",
