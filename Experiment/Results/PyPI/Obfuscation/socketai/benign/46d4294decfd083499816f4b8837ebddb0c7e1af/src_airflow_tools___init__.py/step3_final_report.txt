  "purpose": "Analyze open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code patterns, obfuscation, and suspicious functions.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include environment variables, user inputs, external files, network connections, and dynamic code execution functions like eval().",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are system commands, network transmissions, file writes, or data exfiltration points, especially when untrusted data is processed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or user inputs through functions like eval() or dynamic execution, potentially leading to malicious actions or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated code, use of eval() or exec(), complex variable names, dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or unusual control flows.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits varying levels of suspicion. Reports 1 and 2 show no code or benign patterns, with low risk scores. Report 3 demonstrates obfuscation and dynamic eval usage, justifying higher malware (0.6) and obfuscation (0.8) scores, with a high security risk (0.65). Report 4 is straightforward and benign, with low scores. Report 5 uses eval(), raising security concerns; while no malicious activity is confirmed, the risk score (0.4) is justified, but malware could be slightly increased to reflect eval's danger. Overall, scores align with observed patterns and potential threats.",
  "conclusion": "Most reports are consistent with their analysis. The highest suspicion is in report 3 due to obfuscation and eval, warranting a malware score of 0.6. Report 5's eval() usage suggests a moderate risk, with a security score of 0.4. Minor adjustments could be made to reflect eval() more accurately, but current scores are reasonable. No evidence of active malware exists, but obfuscation and eval() usage justify caution.",
