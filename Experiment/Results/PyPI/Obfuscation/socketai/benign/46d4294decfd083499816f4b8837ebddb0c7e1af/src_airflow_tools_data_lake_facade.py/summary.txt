  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate cloud storage abstraction layer with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malware or malicious behavior. The primary concern is obfuscation and lack of input validation, which could be exploited if inputs are malicious, but the code itself appears safe. Scores of malware 0, obfuscated ~0.4, and risk ~0.3 are appropriate."
