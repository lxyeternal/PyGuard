  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script configuring metadata and reading license content.",
  "sources": "Reads LICENSE file via io.open() and uses embedded string 'ZGYXfsmmEJhDrbHbIixoOUQzIVheUiee=' as a license or encoding parameter.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data flows; potential hidden data within embedded string or license content.",
  "flows": "License file content flows into 'license' parameter; embedded string potentially used as an encoding or secret, but not actively used elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "Embedded string 'ZGYXfsmmEJhDrbHbIixoOUQzIVheUiee=' appears as base64 or obfuscated data; used unconventionally as encoding or license content; invalid encoding in some contexts; 'win_inet_pton' module listed but unused.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with unconventional license handling and suspicious embedded data. The embedded string resembles base64-encoded data and is used as an encoding parameter in some reports, which is invalid and would cause runtime errors. No active malicious code or network activity is evident. The embedded data and unusual license reading suggest obfuscation or concealed payloads. The scores across reports indicate low malware likelihood but high suspicion of obfuscation. The invalid encoding string and embedded data warrant further decoding and analysis to determine if malicious payloads are hidden. Overall, the code appears benign but with anomalies that justify cautious review.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily benign but contains suspicious embedded data and unconventional license handling that could indicate obfuscation or hidden malicious payloads. No active malicious activity is confirmed, but further investigation into the embedded string and its decoding is recommended.",
