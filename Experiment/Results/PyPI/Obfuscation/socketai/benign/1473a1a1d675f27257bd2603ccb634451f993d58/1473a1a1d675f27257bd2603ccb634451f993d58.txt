      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The source code is a legitimate utility with some risky practices, notably dynamic SQL execution, obfuscation, and handling of sensitive data. No direct malware or backdoors are detected, but the obfuscation and dynamic code practices warrant caution. The overall security risk is moderate to high, primarily due to potential misuse if external inputs or dependencies are compromised."

      "obfuscated": 0.75,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code appears to be utility or framework code with significant obfuscation and potential injection risks due to dynamic SQL string formatting. There is no evidence of malicious payloads or active malware. The high obfuscation score is justified, and the malware likelihood remains low. The primary security concern is the potential for SQL injection if inputs are untrusted, but no malicious intent is evident."
