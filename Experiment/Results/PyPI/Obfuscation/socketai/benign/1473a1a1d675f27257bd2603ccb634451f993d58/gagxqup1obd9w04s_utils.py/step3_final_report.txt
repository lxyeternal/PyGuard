  "purpose": "Utility functions for rendering files, processing configurations, cryptographic key handling, and SQL command construction.",
  "sources": "Input dictionaries, file paths, environment variables, cryptographic keys, and configuration data.",
  "sinks": "Rendering functions, SQL execution points, cryptography functions, and file path manipulations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources into rendering, cryptography, and SQL string formatting, potentially leading to injection or execution if inputs are untrusted.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, dynamic string concatenation for paths and SQL commands, and lack of parameterized queries.",
  "analysis": "The code employs obfuscated variable names and constructs SQL commands via string formatting, which could be exploited if inputs are malicious. Cryptography functions are standard. No network activity or backdoors are evident. The functions are utility-focused but could pose injection risks if inputs are untrusted. The obfuscation and dynamic SQL are suspicious but not definitively malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be utility or framework code with significant obfuscation and potential injection risks due to dynamic SQL string formatting. There is no evidence of malicious payloads or active malware. The high obfuscation score is justified, and the malware likelihood remains low. The primary security concern is the potential for SQL injection if inputs are untrusted, but no malicious intent is evident.",
