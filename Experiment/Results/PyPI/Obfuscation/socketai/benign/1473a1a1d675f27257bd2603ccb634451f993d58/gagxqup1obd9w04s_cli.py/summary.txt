  "conclusion": "The source code is a legitimate utility with some risky practices, notably dynamic SQL execution, obfuscation, and handling of sensitive data. No direct malware or backdoors are detected, but the obfuscation and dynamic code practices warrant caution. The overall security risk is moderate to high, primarily due to potential misuse if external inputs or dependencies are compromised."
