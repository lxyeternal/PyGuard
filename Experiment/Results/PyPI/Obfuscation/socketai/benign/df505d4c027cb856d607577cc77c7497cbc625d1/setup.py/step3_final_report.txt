{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for a Python package, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Static package data within the setup() function; no external or untrusted input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows involving untrusted data; no network or file operations.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "The package name 'f9alsmda6nl4o2ck' appears obfuscated or randomly generated, which is suspicious but not malicious. The import of 're' is unused.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup.py script with static data, no dynamic or external data handling, and no malicious code. The unusual package name raises suspicion of obfuscation but does not indicate malicious intent. Malware scores are zero; obfuscation scores are moderate to high, reflecting suspicion about the package name. Security risk scores are very low, consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The package is benign based on this setup script. The main concern is the obfuscated package name, which warrants further review of the actual package contents but does not constitute malicious activity. Scores are appropriate: malware=0, obfuscated≈0.3, securityRisk≈0.1.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.3,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.1,
