  "purpose": "Define a custom syntax highlighting style for the Pygments library based on the Tango style",
  "sources": "Import statements for Pygments Style and token classes; class attribute definitions",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform I/O operations",
  "flows": "N/A; the code is purely a style definition without runtime data flows",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed; the code is static style configuration",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary classes from the Pygments library and defines a subclass 'FlaskyStyle' that specifies various color and style attributes for syntax highlighting tokens. It sets visual styles for different token types such as comments, keywords, strings, numbers, and others, with no dynamic execution or external data handling. No obfuscated constructs or suspicious behaviors are present. The code appears to be a straightforward style configuration for Pygments without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static style definition for syntax highlighting, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It simply customizes visual styles for code tokens and does not perform any I/O or data processing.",
