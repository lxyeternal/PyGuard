  "purpose": "Define a custom syntax highlighting style for the Pygments library based on the Tango style.",
  "sources": "Import statements for Pygments Style and token classes; class attributes defining style properties.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "The code simply assigns style strings to class attributes without dynamic data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary classes and defines a subclass 'FlaskyStyle' with static style properties for syntax highlighting. It uses hardcoded color values and style instructions for various token types, consistent with a style definition. No external input, no data processing, no dynamic execution or obfuscated code. The structure is straightforward and typical for style definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard style definition for Pygments with no malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, and no security risks detected.",
