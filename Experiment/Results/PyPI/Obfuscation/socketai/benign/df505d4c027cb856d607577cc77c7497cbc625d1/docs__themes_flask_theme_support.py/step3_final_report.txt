  "purpose": "Static style configuration for Pygments syntax highlighting, defining color schemes for various token types.",
  "sources": "Import statements for pygments.style and pygments.token modules; class attribute definitions setting style properties.",
  "sinks": "No data input or output operations; no untrusted data handling or external data flows present.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code is static and declarative, with no runtime data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs; straightforward style definitions with clear color mappings.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static class defining a custom Pygments style, with no dynamic behavior, external dependencies, or data processing. It assigns style attributes to syntax tokens using fixed color values. The code is well-structured, readable, and free of obfuscation or malicious patterns. No external data, network operations, or runtime vulnerabilities are present. The style configuration is typical for syntax highlighting themes and does not pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static style configuration for Pygments with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All signals indicate a safe, straightforward theme definition.",
