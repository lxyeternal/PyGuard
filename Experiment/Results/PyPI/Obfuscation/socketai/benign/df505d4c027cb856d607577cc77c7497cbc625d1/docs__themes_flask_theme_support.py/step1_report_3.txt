  "purpose": "Define a custom syntax highlighting style for Pygments used in Flasky projects.",
  "sources": "Import statements for Pygments style components; class attributes setting style properties.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted data; the code solely defines style configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious logic. The code is a static style definition.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules for styling and defines a class 'FlaskyStyle' with style attributes for syntax highlighting. It sets colors and font styles for various code token types. No dynamic code execution, input handling, or network activity is present. The code is purely declarative, with static attribute assignments, indicating it is not obfuscated or malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward style definition for Pygments highlighting. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate configuration file.",
