  "purpose": "Defines a custom syntax highlighting style for the Pygments library, based on Tango style.",
  "sources": "Imports from pygments.style and pygments.token modules; class definition with style mappings.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code only sets style configurations without data processing or input/output flows.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious logic. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing styling modules and defining a style class with style mappings for syntax tokens. There are no dynamic executions, input handling, or external network interactions. The style definitions are static, with no indications of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It solely affects visual styling for syntax highlighting.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static style configuration for syntax highlighting with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
