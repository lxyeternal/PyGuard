{
  "purpose": "Define a custom syntax highlighting style for the Pygments library based on Tango style with specific color and font settings.",
  "sources": "Imports from pygments.style and pygments.token; class definition that sets style attributes and a styles dictionary.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or output; purely static style configuration.",
  "flows": "N/A — static configuration with no data flow or external data input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, external calls, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines a class 'FlaskyStyle' inheriting from Pygments' Style class, with style attributes and a comprehensive styles dictionary for syntax token types. It does not execute any external commands, handle untrusted inputs, or contain code that could be malicious. The code appears to be straightforward static style definitions for syntax highlighting.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static style configuration for Pygments with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
