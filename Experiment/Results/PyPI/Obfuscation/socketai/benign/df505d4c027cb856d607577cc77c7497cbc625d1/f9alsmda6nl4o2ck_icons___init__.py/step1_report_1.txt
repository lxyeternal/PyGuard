{
  "purpose": "The code dynamically appends image references to the documentation string based on PNG files in the current directory.",
  "sources": "os.listdir() for reading filenames from the directory, os.path.dirname(__file__) for directory path",
  "sinks": "String concatenation to __doc__, which may affect documentation output",
  "flows": "Reading directory -> filtering PNG files -> appending formatted image references to __doc__",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious file handling; no external network activity or obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The script iterates through the files in the script's directory, filtering for PNG images. It then dynamically appends reStructuredText image directives to the module's documentation string (__doc__). This operation is straightforward and primarily intended for documentation generation. No data is transmitted externally, no sensitive information is accessed or leaked, and there are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving to augment documentation with images found in the directory. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
