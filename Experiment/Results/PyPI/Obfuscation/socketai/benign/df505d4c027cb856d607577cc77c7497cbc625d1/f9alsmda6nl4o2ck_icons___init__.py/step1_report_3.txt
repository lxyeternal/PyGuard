{
  "purpose": "The code dynamically appends image references to the __doc__ string based on PNG files found in the current directory.",
  "sources": "Reading directory contents with os.listdir(os.path.dirname(__file__))",
  "sinks": "Modifying the __doc__ string by concatenation",
  "flows": "os.listdir -> loop filter -> string concatenation to __doc__",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious function calls; simple directory listing and string modification.",
  "analysis": "The code iterates over files in the current directory, filtering for PNG files. For each PNG file, it appends a formatted string referencing the image to the __doc__ variable, which is typically used as documentation string. There are no network calls, no execution of untrusted input, no data leakage, and no malicious payloads. The code's purpose appears to be to generate documentation content dynamically based on available PNG images. There are no suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or malicious activities detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign; it dynamically updates documentation with image references and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
