  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Imports `os` and `re` (though `re` is unused).\n- Iterates over files in the same directory as the script (`os.path.dirname(__file__)`).\n- Filters for files ending with `.png`.\n- Appends formatted image directives to the module's `__doc__` string.\n\n**Security and Malicious Behavior:**\n- No network activity, external data handling, or execution of untrusted code.\n- No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscated code.\n- The code is purely for documentation augmentation, dynamically including images.\n\n**Review of Reports:**\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and intended for documentation purposes.\n- No suspicious or malicious activity is detected.\n- The only minor anomaly is the unused import of `re`, which is harmless.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), and the malware scores are 0.\n\n**Scores and Justification:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.\n\n**Potential Adjustments:**\n- The scores seem appropriate given the analysis.\n- The only point of note is the unused `re` import, but that does not impact security.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- The code is benign.\n- The purpose is to enhance documentation with local images.\n- No changes needed in the scores.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are consistent with my analysis. The code is safe, simple, and serves a documentation purpose without security concerns.",
