  "purpose": "The code dynamically appends image references to a documentation string (__doc__) based on PNG files in the current directory.",
  "sources": "Reading the list of files in the current directory using os.listdir(os.path.dirname(__file__)).",
  "sinks": "Modifying the __doc__ string by concatenating image references based on filenames.",
  "flows": "os.listdir -> filename filtering -> __doc__ concatenation",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no obfuscated code; the code only appends image references without executing external code or commands.",
  "analysis": "The script lists files in the current directory, filters for PNG files, and appends image directives to the module's documentation string. This behavior is standard for dynamically generating documentation and does not involve any malicious actions or data leaks. The code does not process user input, execute external commands, or access sensitive data. It solely manipulates the __doc__ string based on local filenames.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign script that enhances documentation by including images from the current directory. There are no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this implementation.",
