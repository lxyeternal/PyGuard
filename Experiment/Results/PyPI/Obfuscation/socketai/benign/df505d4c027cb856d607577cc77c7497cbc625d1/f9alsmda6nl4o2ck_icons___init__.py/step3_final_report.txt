{
  "purpose": "Dynamically appends image references to the __doc__ string based on PNG files in the script's directory, likely for documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "os.listdir(os.path.dirname(__file__)) to list directory contents, filename.endswith('.png') to filter PNG files.",
  "sinks": "Appending formatted strings to __doc__, which is used for documentation; no other sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Filesystem listing (source) -> filename filtering -> string formatting -> appending to __doc__ (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Unused import of 're', but otherwise no anomalies or suspicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward directory listing, filters for PNG files, and appends image directives to the documentation string. No malicious activity, external network calls, or obfuscation are present. The purpose appears benign, serving to include images in documentation dynamically. The code is clear, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic. The import of 're' is unused but harmless. The overall behavior is safe and intended for documentation enhancement.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It simply modifies the __doc__ string based on local PNG files, which is a common pattern for dynamic documentation. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
