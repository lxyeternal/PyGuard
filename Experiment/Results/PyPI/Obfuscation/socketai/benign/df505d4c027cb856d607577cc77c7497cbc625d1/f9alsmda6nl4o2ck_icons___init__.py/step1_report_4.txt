  "purpose": "The code dynamically appends image references to a documentation string based on PNG files found in the current directory.",
  "sources": "os.listdir(os.path.dirname(__file__)) reads directory contents.",
  "sinks": "__doc__ += ... modifies the documentation string.",
  "flows": "os.listdir -> for loop -> filename check -> string concatenation to __doc__",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No obfuscated code or malicious behavior apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'os' and 're' modules but only uses 'os' for listing directory contents. It iterates through files in the script's directory, filtering for '.png' files, and appends formatted image references to the '__doc__' string. The process appears straightforward, with no suspicious or malicious operations, no data exfiltration, no network activity, and no obfuscated elements. The presence of 're' import is unused but harmless. Overall, the code's behavior is benign, aimed at generating documentation with images.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple script that augments documentation with images found in its directory. It does not perform any malicious activity or security-sensitive operations. No indicators of malware or security risks are present.",
