  "purpose": "The code dynamically appends image references to a documentation string based on PNG files in the current directory.",
  "sources": "Reading directory contents via os.listdir and os.path.dirname(__file__)",
  "sinks": "Modifying the __doc__ string with formatted image references",
  "flows": "Listing directory -> Filtering PNG files -> Appending formatted strings to __doc__",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. No use of eval, exec, or suspicious network operations. The code only manipulates documentation strings based on filesystem content.",
  "analysis": "The script iterates over files in its directory, filters for PNG files, and appends Markdown image references to its __doc__ string. This is a straightforward operation aimed at enhancing documentation with static images. No data leakage, no network activity, and no suspicious behavior are present. The code does not perform any malicious actions or suspicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, designed solely for documentation purposes, and does not contain malicious or suspicious behavior. It is safe from a security perspective.",
