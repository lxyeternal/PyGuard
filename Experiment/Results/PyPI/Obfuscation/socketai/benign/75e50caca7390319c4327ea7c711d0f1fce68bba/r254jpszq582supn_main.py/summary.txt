  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, internally styled utility for boto3 stub management. No evidence of malicious behavior or malware. Obfuscation is stylistic rather than malicious. Security risks are low, primarily associated with file operations and dynamic code generation, which are standard in build scripts."
