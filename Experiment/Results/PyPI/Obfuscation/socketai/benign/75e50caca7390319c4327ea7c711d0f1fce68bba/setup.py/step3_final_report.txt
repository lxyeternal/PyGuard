{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for a Python package, defining package metadata and dependencies with obfuscated variable names.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' from the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external communications; static metadata passed to setup().",
  "flows": "Reads local file content and passes static data to setup(), with no dynamic or external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated variable names; no dynamic code execution, network activity, or sensitive data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names, which is unusual but not malicious. No malicious code, data leaks, or external communications are present. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not demonstrate malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, risk=0.1-0.2, obfuscated=0.7-0.8) are consistent with the code's behavior and structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate package setup script with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malware or malicious activity. The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not constitute malicious intent. Overall, the security risk is minimal and scores are appropriate.",
