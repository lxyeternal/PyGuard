  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; setting package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows observed; no network or file manipulations that are suspicious.",
  "flows": "Reading file content for description, then passing static parameters to setup() function.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are obfuscated and nonsensical, but this appears to be an intentional obfuscation, not necessarily malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present. No dynamic code execution, code injection, or suspicious operations are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script using setuptools. It reads a README.md file and calls setup() with metadata. The obfuscated variable names do not alter the fundamental behavior. No network activity, file manipulations, or credential handling is present. No signs of malicious intent or malicious code are found. The script appears to be intentionally obfuscated but structurally normal.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate package configuration, although obfuscation might be suspicious if context suggests malicious intent.",
