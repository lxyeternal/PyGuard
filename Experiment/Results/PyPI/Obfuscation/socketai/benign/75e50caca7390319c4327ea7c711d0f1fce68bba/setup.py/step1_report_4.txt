  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that uses setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file using Path(__file__).parent / 'README.md'",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data sinks or external calls present",
  "flows": "Reading file content (source) to variable, then passing static metadata to setup() function (no flow of untrusted data)",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names and strings (e.g., 'CIxXJeworipbUbbJMRlScnTWGNmnRvDB', 'cameqULJCzWPWfAdoJHDufezSQLrOMJG', etc.), which is unusual and may hide malicious intent or obfuscation. No actual malicious behavior detected but the obfuscation is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script that imports Path and setuptools, reads the README file, and calls setup() with metadata. The variable names are obfuscated, which could be an attempt to hide purpose or malicious intent. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or sensitive data handling is present. The code appears to be a typical package setup with intentionally obfuscated variable names but no clear malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "This appears to be a standard package setup script with obfuscated variable names. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident from the code itself, but the obfuscation warrants caution. No malware, data leaks, or suspicious activities are detected.",
