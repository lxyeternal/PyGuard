{
  "purpose": "The code is setting up a Python package using setuptools, configuring metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the content of 'README.md' file via Path(__file__).parent / 'README.md'",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data leads to data leaks or code execution; no network, file, or environment variable interactions are present",
  "flows": "Reads README.md content during setup, but the content is not used beyond variable assignment; no further data flow or execution paths related to untrusted data",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variable names, but no malicious or suspicious behavior; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code actions detected",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup with metadata and dependencies, using obfuscated variable names that do not impact functionality. The only data read is the README.md file content, which is stored in a variable but not used in any malicious way. No network operations, dynamic code execution, or credential handling are present. The code appears to be legitimate package configuration code with minimal obfuscation and no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for a Python package, with obfuscated variable names but no malicious or suspicious behavior. It poses no security risks and appears to be safe.",
