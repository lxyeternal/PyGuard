{
  "purpose": "The functions are intended to create AWS service clients using botocore, likely as wrappers or factory functions.",
  "sources": "Function parameters such as service_name, region_name, aws_access_key_id, aws_secret_access_key, and other AWS configuration options.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive data like aws_access_key_id, aws_secret_access_key, aws_session_token; if misused, could lead to credential theft or unauthorized AWS access.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (sources) are passed into the functions; if implemented, these would be used to instantiate AWS clients, possibly transmitting credentials or configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "The functions are empty (`pass`) with no implementation, which is unusual for production code; function names appear obfuscated or nonsensical, but this alone is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two placeholder functions with identical signatures, intended for AWS client creation but lacking implementation. The reports only show 'Empty response' with no further details, logs, or evidence of malicious activity. Without actual code execution or data, there is no indication of vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. The functions do not perform any operations, and the reports do not provide concrete findings. Credential leakage or malicious payloads are not present in the provided snippets. The absence of implementation prevents any runtime analysis or detection of malicious activity. Given the lack of evidence, the code appears benign, and the reports are incomplete or non-informative.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a placeholder with no active logic, and the reports lack sufficient detail to suggest any security issues. There is no evidence of malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation. The high scores for malware or risk are unjustified; scores should be set to zero. Overall, the code and reports do not indicate any supply chain or security threat.",
