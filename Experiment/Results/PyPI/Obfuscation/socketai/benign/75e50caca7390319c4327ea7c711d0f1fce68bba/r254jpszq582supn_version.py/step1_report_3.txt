  "purpose": "Assigning a version string to a variable, likely indicating the version of a package or module.",
  "sources": "The string literal \"1.38.0\" assigned to the variable aCDLgRVuodTIskaTgGKYByELom.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing, external data sinks, or network operations detected.",
  "flows": "Simple assignment: source (string literal) to variable; no flow to other parts.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable name, which appears as a random string; no other code or logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a variable assignment with a seemingly random variable name and a version string. There are no inputs, outputs, external calls, or logic that could indicate malicious activity. The variable name does not correlate with common naming conventions, which might be obfuscation or just arbitrary naming. No suspicious patterns, code injection, or data leaks are evident. The code is minimal and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple assignment statement setting a version string to a variable with an obfuscated name. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this fragment.",
