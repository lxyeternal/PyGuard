{
  "purpose": "Defines type aliases for AWS service names using Python's Literal type for type hinting and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'typing_extensions' or 'typing' modules; assignment of large Literal lists containing AWS service names.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data handling or external data output observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily defines constants and types.",
  "anomalies": "Unusually large Literal lists may be used for validation or selection purposes but do not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are present. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports 'Literal' for compatibility, then defines two extensive Literal type aliases containing AWS service names. These lists are static and do not process or handle external inputs. No functions, network operations, or data manipulation are included. The code's structure suggests it's meant for type checking and code documentation. There are no signs of malware, suspicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities within this code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely declares type aliases for AWS service names, serving as a reference or validation mechanism. There are no indications of malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks.",
