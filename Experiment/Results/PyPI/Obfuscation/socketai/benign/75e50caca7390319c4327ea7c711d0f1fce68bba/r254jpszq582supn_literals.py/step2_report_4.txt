  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Type definitions for AWS service names.\n- Source: Import of 'Literal', large static lists.\n- Sink/Flow: No external data, no execution, purely static.\n- Anomalies: Obfuscated variable names, but no malicious behavior.\n- Analysis: Static, benign type annotations.\n- Conclusion: No malware or security risks.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Obfuscated: 0.2\n- Malware: 0\n- Security Risk: 0.1\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing static definitions.\n- No external data or dynamic code.\n- Obfuscated variable names, but no malicious intent.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same pattern: static type alias definitions with obfuscated variable names.\n- No dynamic or malicious code.\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Obfuscated: 0.4 (slightly higher, but still consistent with code generation)\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar static type definitions.\n- Obfuscated variable names, but no malicious activity.\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Obfuscated: 0.8 (higher, but still within normal for generated code)\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same pattern: static, type annotations, no malicious behavior.\n- No obfuscation level specified, but overall consistent.\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n- Confidence: 1\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Are there any signs of malware?**  \n  No. All reports clearly state that the code is static, only defining large literal type annotations for AWS service names, with no dynamic code, network activity, or data handling.\n\n- **Obfuscation?**  \n  Variable names are intentionally obscure or auto-generated, but this is common in generated code or internal type definitions, not necessarily malicious.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities?**  \n  No. The code is purely declarative. No secrets, no external inputs, no code execution.\n\n- **Malware score justification:**  \n  The malware score should be **0**. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n- **Security risk score justification:**  \n  Given the absence of external data handling, secrets, or system modifications, the security risk is minimal. A score of **0.1** (as in reports) is reasonable, but could be lowered to **0** for clarity.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  The obfuscation levels vary but are generally consistent with auto-generated code. An obfuscated score of **0.2-0.4** is appropriate.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0.2** (average of reports)  \n- **Risk score:** **0** (since no security issues are present)\n\n### Summary:\n\nThis code is a benign static type definition module for AWS service names, with no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious logic. The obfuscated variable names are likely due to code generation or internal conventions, not malicious intent.\n\n**Final estimate:**\n\n| Score Type     | Value |\n|----------------|--------|\n| Malware        | 0      |\n| Obfuscated     | 0.2    |\n| Security Risk  | 0      |\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a more detailed breakdown or further analysis.",
