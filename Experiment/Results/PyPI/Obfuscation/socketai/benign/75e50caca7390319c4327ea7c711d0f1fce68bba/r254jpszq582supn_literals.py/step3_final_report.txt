  "purpose": "Static type annotations defining AWS service name literals for type checking and validation.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'Literal' with fallback, large lists of AWS service names assigned to variables.",
  "sinks": "None; the code is purely declarative with no data flow or external interactions.",
  "flows": "N/A; static definitions without data flow or execution paths.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated or auto-generated variable names, but no malicious or suspicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of large static lists of AWS service names assigned to type aliases using 'Literal'. No dynamic code, network activity, or data handling is present. Variable names are obfuscated but likely due to code generation, not malicious intent. No secrets, backdoors, or vulnerabilities are detected. The import fallback for 'Literal' is standard. The code's purpose appears to be static type safety or documentation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static type declaration module for AWS services. There is no evidence of malware, malicious obfuscation, or security risks. The obfuscation of variable names is likely due to code generation or internal conventions, not malicious intent.",
