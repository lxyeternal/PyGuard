{
  "purpose": "Defines type literals for AWS service names used in the project, likely for type annotations.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'Literal' from 'typing_extensions' or 'typing'. The rest are static string definitions.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks. No network, file, or environment interactions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code only defines constants and type aliases.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code. The variable names are obscure but consistent with obfuscation or code-generation patterns. No dynamic execution, no suspicious API calls, no input/output handling.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports 'Literal', which is standard. It then defines two large Literal type aliases containing lists of AWS service names as strings. These are static data structures. There are no functions, no input/output handling, no network activity, or system modifications. Variable names like 'CoFsCxgGaSbusFsvWeVCSrdWbMXCsTKS' and 'eFPCphyteeTVpcgFgOyVTAZSjGWuKoll' are obfuscated or auto-generated, which can sometimes be a sign of malicious or obfuscated code, but in this case, they only hold large string lists for type annotations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is solely for defining type aliases for AWS service names, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscated variable names are likely due to code generation or obfuscation for licensing or internal purposes, not malicious intent.",
