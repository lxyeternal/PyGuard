  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple Python script that imports standard modules and performs basic operations such as printing messages and handling variables.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly present; the code does not read external data or user input.",
  "sinks": "The code does not perform any file writes, network operations, or sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present; the code executes straightforward operations without external data influence.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs detected. No hidden or suspicious code segments are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is minimalistic, importing only standard modules and executing simple print statements and variable assignments. There are no indications of malicious intent, data leaks, or suspicious behavior. The absence of external data handling, network activity, or obfuscated patterns suggests benign functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs basic operations without external dependencies or potentially harmful actions.",
