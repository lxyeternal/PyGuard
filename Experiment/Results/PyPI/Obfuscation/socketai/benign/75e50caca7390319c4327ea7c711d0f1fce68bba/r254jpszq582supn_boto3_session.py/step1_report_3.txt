  "purpose": "Attempt to import all contents from mypy_boto3.boto3_session_gen for type hinting or static analysis purposes.",
  "sources": "The import statement in the try block.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow or processing occurs beyond the import attempt.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a broad wildcard import (from ... import *), which can obscure code behavior, but is not inherently malicious. The try-except block suppresses ImportError, which might be for optional dependencies or compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code tries to import all symbols from 'mypy_boto3.boto3_session_gen', which appears to be a type hinting or static analysis library for boto3. If the import fails, it silently passes. No code execution, network activity, or data manipulation occurs. The code structure is straightforward with no suspicious logic. The broad import could potentially hide malicious code if the module itself were malicious, but based on the filename, it appears to be a type hinting library related to boto3.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, safe import statement designed for static analysis or type hinting support. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks. The only minor concern is the use of 'import *', which is a style concern but not malicious.",
