{
  "purpose": "Optional import of mypy_boto3.boto3_session_gen for static analysis or type hinting, handled gracefully if unavailable.",
  "sources": "The try-except block attempting to import all symbols from the module.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; the code does not process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the import is static and does not involve runtime data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' in a try-except block, which is discouraged but common in type hinting modules; no malicious anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, benign pattern for optional dependencies or static analysis support. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The broad import 'import *' is a style concern but not malicious. The exception handling ensures safe fallback. The malware score is 0, obfuscated is 0, and the security risk is minimal (~0.1) due to the broad import pattern, which is acceptable in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, benign, and intended for development or static analysis purposes. The scores are appropriate; no modifications needed.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
