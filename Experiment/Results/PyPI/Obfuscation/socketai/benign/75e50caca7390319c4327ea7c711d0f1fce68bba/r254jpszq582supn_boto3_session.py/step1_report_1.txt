  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data processing or external data output",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths observed",
  "anomalies": "Use of a broad import with wildcard '*' can obscure what is imported, but this is common in type hinting modules; no suspicious code or hidden behaviors detected",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import all symbols from a specific module, likely for type checking or static analysis, and handles ImportError gracefully. There are no signs of malicious activity, such as network calls, data leaks, or backdoors. The code is minimal and appears safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import with error handling for a type hinting or static analysis module, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
