  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the presence of issues, the validity of their reasoning, and the appropriateness of their scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** Simple import with error handling; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** confidence=1, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code is a minimal, standard pattern for optional imports.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The reasoning is sound.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with a note on the broad import being unconventional but benign.\n- **Scores:** confidence=0.9, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0.1\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The use of `import *` can be style concern but not malicious.\n- The securityRisk score of 0.1 is marginally justified, considering the broad import could, in theory, hide malicious code if the module were compromised, but the filename suggests a type hinting library.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are reasonable. Slightly conservative but acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Same pattern, with emphasis on the benign nature.\n- **Scores:** confidence=0.9, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0.1\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Consistent with previous assessments.\n- No suspicious activity detected.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates the benign nature, with focus on the optional dependency pattern.\n- **Scores:** confidence=0.9, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0.1\n\n**Assessment:**\n- No malicious indicators.\n- The pattern is common and safe.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, for type hints/development support.\n- **Scores:** confidence=0.9, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0.1\n\n**Assessment:**\n- No signs of malicious behavior.\n- The broad import and exception handling are typical for optional dependencies.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, consistent with the code and analysis.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All zero, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1) for some reports due to the broad import, but justified given the context.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The code snippets are benign, intended for static analysis or type hinting.\n- The scores are consistent and reasonable.\n- No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to broad import, but minimal and typical in such contexts)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores reflect the low risk and benign nature of the code.",
