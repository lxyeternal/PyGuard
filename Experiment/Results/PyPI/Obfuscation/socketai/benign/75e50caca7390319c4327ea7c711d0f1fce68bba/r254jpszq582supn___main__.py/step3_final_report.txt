  "purpose": "Import and invoke an obfuscated symbol from a type stub package, potentially executing code.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'mypy_boto3.main' and immediate invocation of the imported symbol.",
  "sinks": "Invocation of the imported symbol, which could execute code or perform actions if malicious.",
  "flows": "Import from 'mypy_boto3.main' -> immediate call of 'sMxvGaUBdqTJPxosnsPQoeVeHVnWWQSU()'.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated symbol name, use of a static type stub package at runtime, immediate invocation without context.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a symbol with a highly obfuscated name from 'mypy_boto3.main', a package intended for static type checking, not runtime execution. The immediate invocation of this symbol could execute malicious code if the symbol is malicious. The obfuscation and minimal context are suspicious but do not confirm malicious intent. The pattern is consistent with obfuscated or potentially malicious code often used to hide behavior. No data leaks, network activity, or malicious payloads are evident in this snippet. The scores from reports suggest moderate suspicion, primarily due to obfuscation, with malware likelihood around 0.3-0.4, and a high obfuscation score (~0.8). The overall security risk is moderate (~0.4-0.5). Further static or dynamic analysis of the symbol's behavior is recommended before deployment.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious obfuscation and pattern of immediate invocation, which warrants caution. There is no direct evidence of malicious activity, but the pattern is typical of obfuscated malicious code. The scores should reflect moderate concern, with malware suspicion around 0.3 and a high obfuscation score (~0.8). Further analysis is advised to confirm the intent of the imported symbol.",
