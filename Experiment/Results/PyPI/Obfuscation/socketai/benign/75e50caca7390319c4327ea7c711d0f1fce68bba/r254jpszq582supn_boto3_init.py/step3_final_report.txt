  "purpose": "Conditional import of mypy_boto3.boto3_init_gen for static type checking or IDE support.",
  "sources": "Attempted import from mypy_boto3.boto3_init_gen within try block.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows, network operations, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Import statement as source; no data flow to sinks identified.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad 'import *' in a try-except block; silent failure on ImportError.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import all symbols from a static type stub module, wrapped in a try-except to silently ignore ImportError. This pattern is common for optional dependencies used solely for static analysis or IDE support. No malicious behavior, network activity, or data handling is involved. The broad import could be considered a minor namespace pollution concern but is typical in stub modules. Scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. Confidence in benign assessment is high due to the straightforward pattern and lack of suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard pattern for optional static type support with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
