The `$info` statement is used for logging, not malicious activity. No suspicious or obfuscated code features are present.\",\n  \"analysis\": \"The code initializes a real variable `r` and assigns it the value from `$foo(\"asdf\")`. It then logs information with `$info`, printing `bar:52`, which corresponds to `$bar(42)`. The functions `$foo`, `$bar`, and `$info` are system or simulation functions typical in hardware description languages. No external data sources, user input, or network interactions are involved. The code does not perform any file I/O, system modification, or malicious behavior. The usage appears to be benign and for simulation purposes.\",\n  \"conclusion\": \"The code is benign, serving as a simulation or logging script without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It does not contain malware or security risks. The use of functions and data flow is straightforward and safe.\",\n  \"confidence\": 1,\n  \"obfuscated\": 0,\n  \"malware\": 0,\n  \"securityRisk\": 0\n}",
