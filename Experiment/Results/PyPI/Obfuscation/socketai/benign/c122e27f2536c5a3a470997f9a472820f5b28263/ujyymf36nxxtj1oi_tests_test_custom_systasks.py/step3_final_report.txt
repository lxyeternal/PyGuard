The functions are non-standard but appear benign, likely placeholders or simulation utilities. No malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or obfuscation is evident. The security implications are minimal, with no hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads. The functions' safety depends on their implementation, which is not provided, but based on the context, they are considered safe. The overall risk is low, and the malware likelihood is negligible.\",\n  \"conclusion\": \"The code is benign, used for simulation or diagnostic purposes, with no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. The non-standard functions warrant verification but do not indicate malicious intent. The security scores should remain at zero for malware and obfuscation, with a very low risk score reflecting uncertainty about the functions' implementation.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.8,\n  \"obfuscated\": 0,\n  \"malware\": 0,\n  \"securityRisk\": 0\n}",
