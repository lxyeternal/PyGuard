{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for a Python package, configuring package metadata and reading a README file for the long description.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file; static assignment of package metadata variables",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or data sinks; no network or external data handling observed",
  "flows": "Reading README content into a variable, then passing static metadata to setuptools.setup()",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names that are used consistently; no dynamic code execution or malicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script with superficial obfuscation through variable names. It reads a README file and calls setuptools.setup() with static, hardcoded package information. No dynamic input, network activity, or security-sensitive operations are present. The obfuscation appears superficial and does not indicate malicious intent. All indicators point to benign package configuration code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with superficial obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The obfuscation reduces clarity but does not imply malicious intent.",
