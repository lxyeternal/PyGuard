  "purpose": "Import all contents from the api2pdf module and define a variable with a string value.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .api2pdf",
  "sinks": "Assignment to variable iNsAsnSVbhtAJGFofzMyqFGyEORDYOsO",
  "flows": "Imported module contents are brought into current namespace; variable assigned a static string value",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable name with random characters; no immediate malicious activity detected, but the variable name could be used for obfuscation or tracking",
  "analysis": "The code imports all functions or classes from a local module named api2pdf, which could be used for PDF manipulation. The variable name 'iNsAsnSVbhtAJGFofzMyqFGyEORDYOsO' appears to be a random string, possibly obfuscated, but it is only assigned a static string 'api2pdf'. There are no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, network communication, or code execution. The import is standard, and the variable assignment is benign but unusual in naming.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard import and assigns a static string to a uniquely named variable. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The unusual variable name could suggest obfuscation, but on its own, it does not indicate malicious intent.",
