{
  "purpose": "The code performs a wildcard import from a local module 'api2pdf' and assigns an obfuscated string to a variable with an obfuscated name.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from .api2pdf import *' reads all symbols from the module; the variable assignment reads no external input but assigns a static string.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks such as network calls, data exfiltration, or system modifications present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The code imports symbols into the current namespace and assigns a static string to a variable; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' which can hide malicious functions; obfuscated variable name 'iNsAsnSVbhtAJGFofzMyqFGyEORDYOsO'; minimal code with no context of 'api2pdf' content.",
  "analysis": "The code imports all symbols from a local module using a wildcard, which can conceal malicious functions or classes. The variable name is obfuscated, raising suspicion about concealment or malicious intent. The static string assignment is benign. No direct malicious activity, such as network communication or data leakage, is evident. The high obfuscation score reflects the suspicious naming, and the moderate risk score accounts for the potential of concealed malicious code within the imported module. The malware score remains low due to lack of evidence of malicious actions. Overall, the pattern is suspicious but not definitively malicious; further review of the 'api2pdf' module is recommended.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious patterns typical of obfuscation and concealment, primarily due to the use of wildcard import and obfuscated variable names. However, there is no direct evidence of malicious activity in this snippet. The scores assigned are appropriate, indicating low malware likelihood but moderate suspicion. Further inspection of the 'api2pdf' module is advised to confirm its safety.",
