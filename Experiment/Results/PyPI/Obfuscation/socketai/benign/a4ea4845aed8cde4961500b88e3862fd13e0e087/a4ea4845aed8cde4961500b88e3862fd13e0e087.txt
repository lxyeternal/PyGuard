      "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious patterns typical of obfuscation and concealment, primarily due to the use of wildcard import and obfuscated variable names. However, there is no direct evidence of malicious activity in this snippet. The scores assigned are appropriate, indicating low malware likelihood but moderate suspicion. Further inspection of the 'api2pdf' module is advised to confirm its safety."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, albeit obfuscated, API wrapper for PDF processing. There is no evidence of malware or malicious behavior. The high obfuscation scores are justified, but the malware and security risk scores should remain low. Overall, the code appears safe for use, with obfuscation being the primary concern for review transparency."
