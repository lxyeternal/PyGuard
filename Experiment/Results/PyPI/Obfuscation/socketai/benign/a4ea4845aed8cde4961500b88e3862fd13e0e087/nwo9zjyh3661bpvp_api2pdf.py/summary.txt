  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, albeit obfuscated, API wrapper for PDF processing. There is no evidence of malware or malicious behavior. The high obfuscation scores are justified, but the malware and security risk scores should remain low. Overall, the code appears safe for use, with obfuscation being the primary concern for review transparency."
