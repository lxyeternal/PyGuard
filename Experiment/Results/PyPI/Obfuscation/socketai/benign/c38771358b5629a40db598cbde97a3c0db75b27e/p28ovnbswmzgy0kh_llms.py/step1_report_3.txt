  "purpose": "Provide instructions and example usage for integrating with the Together AI API in a Python project.",
  "sources": "Reading API key from environment variable `TOGETHER_API_KEY`, user input prompt, and optional parameters for API call.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive data such as API keys and user prompts could be exposed if mishandled, but no direct data exfiltration or malicious data flow is evident.",
  "flows": "API key from environment variable or init param -> API call with prompt and parameters -> response returned as string.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. The code is primarily documentation and example usage without actual functional implementation shown.",
  "analysis": "The provided text is a code comment and documentation snippet, explaining how to use the Together AI API. It includes instructions for obtaining an API key, setting environment variables, and example code for initializing a model object. There are no code execution segments, no data processing, and no functions or logic that could be malicious. The documentation references API endpoints and parameters but does not execute code or handle data insecurely. It appears to be a standard usage guide rather than an active script or malicious payload.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed content is purely documentation and example code, with no executable malicious behavior detected. It does not contain malicious intent or malicious payloads. The code is safe and appropriate for its intended purpose of guiding users.",
