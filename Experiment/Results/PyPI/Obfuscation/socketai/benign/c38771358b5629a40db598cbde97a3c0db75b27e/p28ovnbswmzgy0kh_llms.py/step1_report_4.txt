  "purpose": "The code provides usage instructions and example for interacting with the Together AI API, including setting API keys and configuration parameters for model inference.",
  "sources": "API key retrieval from environment variable 'TOGETHER_API_KEY', and the example code importing and initializing the Together class with parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks could occur if API keys are exposed or hardcoded, but in this case, the key is retrieved from environment variables, not hardcoded.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'TOGETHER_API_KEY' → API key used for authentication in API requests; code execution flow involving the Together class initialization and parameter passing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors observed. The code snippet primarily provides documentation and an example for API usage.",
  "analysis": "The code contains no executable malicious logic. It reads an API key from an environment variable, which is a standard and secure practice. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are present. The code mainly offers instructions, references, and example usage for an API client. There are no signs of data exfiltration, malicious commands, or obfuscation. The structure is typical for API documentation snippets.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard documentation and example code for interacting with an API, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It follows good practices by using environment variables for secrets. Overall, it appears safe and legitimate.",
