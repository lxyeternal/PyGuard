  "purpose": "Provides instructions and example usage for integrating with the Together AI API for language model completions.",
  "sources": "Reads API key from environment variable 'TOGETHER_API_KEY' and user-provided init parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive information like API keys stored in environment variables and passed as parameters; no other sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Source (environment variable or init param) -> usage in API calls for authentication.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code is primarily documentation and example snippets.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly consists of descriptive comments, instructions, and example code snippets for API usage. It mentions retrieving an API key from environment variables and passing it as an init parameter, which is standard practice. No code execution, dynamic code, or suspicious behaviors such as network connections or data exfiltration are present. The code appears to be part of documentation or sample implementation rather than functional malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is benign, serving as documentation and example usage for API integration. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware indicators. No security threats identified based on the code shown.",
