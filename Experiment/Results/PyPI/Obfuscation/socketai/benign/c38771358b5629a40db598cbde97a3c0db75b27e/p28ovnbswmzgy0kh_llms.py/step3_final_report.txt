{
  "purpose": "The code provides documentation and example snippets for using the Together AI API, including API key handling and model configuration.",
  "sources": "Reads API key from environment variable 'TOGETHER_API_KEY' or init parameter; no other data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or malicious data flows detected.",
  "flows": "API key retrieval from environment or init parameter; no malicious or suspicious data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; code is purely instructional.",
  "analysis": "The code is standard documentation with example usage; no malicious or maliciously obfuscated code present. API key handling follows best practices. No suspicious behaviors or security issues are detected. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is minimal (~0.1), reflecting standard API key management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured documentation for API interaction, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0.1 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
