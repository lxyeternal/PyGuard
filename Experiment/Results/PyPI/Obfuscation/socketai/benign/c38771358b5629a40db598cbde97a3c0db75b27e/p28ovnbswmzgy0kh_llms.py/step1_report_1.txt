{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be documentation and example usage for a Python package interacting with the Together AI API, primarily for model inference and prompt generation.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'TOGETHER_API_KEY' and the API key passed as an init parameter, as well as user-provided prompts and parameters.",
  "sinks": "API calls to 'https://api.together.ai', potentially exposing API keys, and handling user prompts that could be malicious if not sanitized.",
  "flows": "API key is read from environment variable or init parameter, then used in API request headers; user prompts flow into API calls for model inference.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Documentation includes URLs, but no malicious intent detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists mainly of descriptive comments and example snippets for interacting with the Together AI API. It reads the API key from environment variables or parameters, which is standard practice. No data is being maliciously transmitted or stored beyond the intended API calls. There are no signs of code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The code does not perform any unsafe operations, such as executing untrusted input, or accessing sensitive data without authorization.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is purely informational/documentation with example code snippets for API interaction. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be standard, safe usage instructions for a Python library interacting with an external API.",
