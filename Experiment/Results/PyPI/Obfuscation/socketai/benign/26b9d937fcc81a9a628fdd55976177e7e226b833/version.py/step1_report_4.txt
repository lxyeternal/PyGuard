  "purpose": "Assignment of a version string to a variable, likely used for package or dependency management.",
  "sources": "Assignment statement where the string '0.26.12' is assigned to the variable 'tNXzYKBDDztnaZRbLxuCgugisCFwhKYz'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow to external systems or sensitive operations detected.",
  "flows": "N/A, simple variable assignment with no data flow to external sources or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable name (obfuscated or nonsensical), but no malicious behavior observed; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a variable assignment where a string representing a version number is assigned to an obfuscated variable name. There are no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, network communication, or code execution. The variable name appears intentionally obfuscated, but this alone does not indicate malicious intent. No other code fragments or behaviors are present that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to a variable with an obfuscated name. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected. The overall security risk is negligible.",
