  "purpose": "Assignment of a version string to a variable.",
  "sources": "The code reads a hardcoded string assigned to the variable 'tNXzYKBDDztnaZRbLxuCgugisCFwhKYz'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process or output data to external sources.",
  "flows": "The flow is simple: hardcoded string assigned to a variable; no further data flow or processing observed.",
  "anomalies": "The variable name appears obfuscated and nonsensical; the code is minimal with no context or additional logic. No suspicious behavior, no external data, no processing.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a variable assignment with a nonsensical variable name and a version string. There are no inputs, outputs, or data processing. The variable name is obfuscated, but this alone is not indicative of malicious intent. No suspicious behavior or malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple assignment of a version string to an obfuscated variable name. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks based on this fragment.",
