{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific modules and classes from the 'dagster_shared' and 'dagster_deltalake_polars' packages, then registers a version identifier for the 'dagster-deltalake-polars' library.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'dagster_shared.libraries', 'dagster_deltalake_polars.deltalake_polars_type_handler', and 'dagster_deltalake_polars.version'. The registration call uses a version variable.",
  "sinks": "The registration call may involve registering version info, but no untrusted input or data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "Imports are static; the registration function likely stores version info internally, with no flow of untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "The import aliases use obfuscated or auto-generated identifiers (e.g., ZDKXSjuJjBDlfHgygimNhDRZLFoIncZB), which could be suspicious if intentional obfuscation. However, they are within the scope of standard module import practices and don't directly indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard library imports and a registration call, all typical for a Python package setup or plugin registration process. The aliasing of imported classes using seemingly random or obfuscated names might be an attempt to hide the class names, but this pattern alone is not conclusive evidence of malicious behavior. There are no external data inputs, network connections, or code execution beyond standard import and registration. The overall structure appears consistent with normal package initialization code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module registration script with obfuscated import aliases that could raise suspicion but are not inherently malicious. No evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks is identified.",
