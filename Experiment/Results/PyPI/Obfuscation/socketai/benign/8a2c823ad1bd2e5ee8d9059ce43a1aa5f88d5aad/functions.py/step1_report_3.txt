  "purpose": "Define custom SQL functions using SQLAlchemy's GenericFunction class",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading; class definitions are static",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data or control flow leading to potential security impacts",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted input handling; classes only define metadata for SQL functions",
  "anomalies": "Unusual naming conventions and obfuscated class names, but no malicious behavior or hidden code",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom SQL function classes inheriting from SQLAlchemy's GenericFunction, setting function names 'first' and 'last' with a boolean attribute. No external input handling, no dynamic execution, no network activity, or sensitive operations observed. The naming appears obfuscated but does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely defines custom SQL functions with obfuscated class names but no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears benign and purely declarative for SQLAlchemy ORM use.",
