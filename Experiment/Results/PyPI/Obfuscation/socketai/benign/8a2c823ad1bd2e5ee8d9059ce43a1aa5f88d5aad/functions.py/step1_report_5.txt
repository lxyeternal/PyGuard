  "purpose": "Define custom SQL functions for use with SQLAlchemy, possibly to be used as SQL aggregate functions.",
  "sources": "Imports from sqlalchemy.sql.functions and class attribute assignments within custom classes.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no untrusted data processing or output is shown.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external input to output; classes define static attributes for SQL function representations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class names and attribute names; no clear meaningful identifiers; potential code obfuscation pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code imports GenericFunction from SQLAlchemy to define two custom classes representing SQL functions. Each class sets class attributes that specify SQL function names ('first' and 'last') and a boolean flag. The naming of classes and attributes appears deliberately obfuscated, which could be a tactic to conceal purpose. There are no apparent inputs, data processing, network activity, or malicious operations. The code appears to be an attempt to define custom SQL functions in an obscure manner, but nothing inherently malicious is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code defines custom SQL functions with obfuscated identifiers, likely for use with SQLAlchemy. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. The obfuscation appears to be for concealment rather than malicious intent.",
