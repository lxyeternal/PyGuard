{
  "purpose": "Define custom SQL functions using SQLAlchemy's GenericFunction class, likely for use in database queries.",
  "sources": "Imports from sqlalchemy.sql.functions and class definitions that set class attributes.",
  "sinks": "No obvious sinks; no data output or external communication in the code.",
  "flows": "Import leads to class definitions; class attributes are static and do not process untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "Class attributes are set to string values ('first' and 'last') and boolean True; no dynamic or user input involved. No obfuscated code, no hardcoded credentials, or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two subclasses of SQLAlchemy's GenericFunction, assigning string identifiers and boolean flags as class attributes. These appear to be intended as custom SQL functions or expressions for use within SQLAlchemy queries. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The attributes 'first' and 'last' could be placeholders or intended for specific SQL function behaviors, but their usage here does not indicate malicious intent. The code is straightforward and does not contain obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign definition of custom SQL functions for use with SQLAlchemy. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. It appears to be a structural setup for database query extensions without any malicious intent or security risks.",
