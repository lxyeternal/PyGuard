{
  "purpose": "To configure and set up a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading beyond the import statement.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code merely invokes setup() without parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Very minimal code; no suspicious or unusual behavior observed. The setup() call is unconfigured, which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'setuptools' library and calls setup() with default parameters. This is typical for package setup scripts but does not contain any malicious logic or suspicious activity. No data is read, no sensitive operations are performed, and there are no indicators of malware or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious behavior detected.",
