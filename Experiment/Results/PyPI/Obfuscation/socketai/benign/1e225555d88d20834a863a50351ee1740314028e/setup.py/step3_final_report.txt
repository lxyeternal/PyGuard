  "purpose": "Minimal setup script importing 'setuptools' and calling setup() with no arguments.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'setuptools' and the call to 'setup()'.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Import of 'setup' from 'setuptools' followed by invocation of 'setup()' with no arguments.",
  "anomalies": "Calling 'setup()' without arguments is unusual but not malicious; no obfuscation or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward minimal setup script. It imports 'setup' from 'setuptools' and calls it without arguments, which is common in placeholder or incomplete package configurations. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard for a minimal setup script, and contains no malicious or security risks. All reports are accurate and consistent with the code content. No modifications needed.",
