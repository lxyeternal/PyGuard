{
  "purpose": "This code defines generic data structures and functions for state transition mappings, likely for use in automata or state machine implementations.",
  "sources": "Input data from provided mappings, function parameters, environment variables (not explicitly used here), and iterable symbols.",
  "sinks": "Potential data sinks include the __call__ methods which invoke functions and retrieve or modify states, and the WGDGNukguWKtaWXUGpKMHZTzHlQorlPL method which constructs mappings.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters and mappings through __call__ methods, functions like MEtFPEbDzpGqgUkrEEohDzCeUeCUksUH, and the WGDGNukguWKtaWXUGpKMHZTzHlQorlPL method, potentially affecting state objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, or suspicious domain/IP references. Use of partial functions is standard. No malicious code or backdoors evident.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type-annotated classes and functions for managing state transitions with strict and lenient modes. It uses mappings for state updates and includes a method for restoring initial state. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The functions and classes appear to implement standard state machine mechanics without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a state transition system with no signs of malware or malicious behavior. It is well-structured for automata-like use, with no suspicious data flows or anomalies. Overall security risk is low.",
