{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define functional utilities and classes for managing state transitions using mappings, likely for state machine or automaton-like behavior.",
  "sources": "Data is read from input parameters to functions, such as mappings, states, symbols, and input data provided to the __call__ methods and partial functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include dictionary lookups, get() calls, and dynamic partial application, but no direct output, network operations, or system calls are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (states, symbols, mappings) through functions and methods that access or modify state variables, and produce or update state accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code features are present. The code structure is standard for state transition utilities. No malicious privacy violations or system manipulations are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines generic types, utility functions, and classes for state management. The functions perform dictionary lookups, including optional get() calls, and partial application. The class implements a stateful automaton with methods to initialize, transition states, and reset to initial state. There are no external data leaks, network operations, or system manipulations. The code is consistent with a state machine implementation, with clear intent, and no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a state transition utility for state management, with no indications of malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks. It is a standard implementation of state handling mechanisms without obfuscated or malicious code elements.",
