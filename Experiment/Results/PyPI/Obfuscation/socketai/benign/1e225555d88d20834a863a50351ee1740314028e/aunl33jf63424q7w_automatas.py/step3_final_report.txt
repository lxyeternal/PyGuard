{
  "purpose": "Provides a framework for managing state transitions using mappings and functions, facilitating flexible state machine implementations.",
  "sources": "Reads input states and symbols from function parameters and internal data structures; accesses mappings for state transitions.",
  "sinks": "Uses mappings to determine next states; no external data leaks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Source states and symbols flow into functions which retrieve or compute next states via mappings; no external sinks involved.",
  "anomalies": "Variable and class names are heavily obfuscated, which could be intended to conceal purpose but does not directly indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines generic data structures and functions for state transition management, including utility classes and functions for flexible mapping access. No external data handling, network activity, or malicious code patterns are present. Obfuscation is notable but not evidence of malicious behavior. The logic is consistent with legitimate state machine utilities, with standard use of mappings and callables. No signs of code injection, backdoors, or malicious payloads are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a state transition framework, with obfuscated naming that warrants cautious review but no concrete evidence of malicious intent. The overall security risk is low, though obfuscation should be monitored.",
