{
  "purpose": "Define type-safe new types and data structures related to time interval indexing and slices, possibly for use in data analysis or time series processing.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (creek.multi_streams, warnings, dataclasses, typing, numbers); function WmyeCNgWEyjetHPjrpKXkBqxnnkXlHYh reads parameters; type definitions and constants initialized with no external data input.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs detected. No external network or file operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks. The code mostly defines types, constants, and a data class.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated function name 'WmyeCNgWEyjetHPjrpKXkBqxnnkXlHYh'; multiple meaningless variable names; presence of import warning that indicates deprecation or relocation of a module; no actual logic beyond type definitions and constant initializations.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of importing modules, issuing a warning, defining a utility function with obfuscated naming, and creating several type aliases and constants related to time indexing and intervals. The function WmyeCNgWEyjetHPjrpKXkBqxnnkXlHYh creates new type wrappers with optional documentation and aliasing, but it is not invoked with external data. The constants define time index types and interval tuple/slice types, along with iterable type aliases and a data class. No external inputs, network calls, file I/O, or executable code are present. The obfuscated function names and variable naming patterns suggest possible obfuscation or code mangling, but no malicious intent is evident from the content. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of type and data structure definitions with obfuscated naming, likely for internal use in a larger project. There is no indication of malicious behavior, malicious data handling, or supply chain sabotage. The only minor concern is obfuscation, but this alone does not suggest malicious intent.",
