{
  "purpose": "Defines type aliases and data structures for handling time interval data, with no apparent malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and functions; defines functions and constants; reads no untrusted input directly.",
  "sinks": "No sinks detected; no data is written to external systems, no network calls or file operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code mainly sets up type definitions and documentation.",
  "anomalies": "The function WmyeCNgWEyjetHPjrpKXkBqxnnkXlHYh uses an obfuscated name and creates a NewType with a descriptive docstring; the variable names are nonsensical and obfuscated, which may suggest attempt at hiding intent or merely poor naming conventions. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code are visible. No dynamic code execution or suspicious imports are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules, defines a utility function to create new types with optional documentation and aliases, and sets up several type aliases related to time interval representations. The function and variables use obfuscated names, but the logic is straightforward and harmless. No external data reading, no network activity, and no evident malicious behavior are present. The code appears to be solely for type safety and data structure definitions. The initial warning about moving modules is benign and not related to malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard type alias and data class setup with obfuscated naming, but contains no malicious or security-risk code. The obfuscation may be an attempt to hide complexity or simply poor naming; no malicious intent is evident. Overall, it poses no security threat.",
