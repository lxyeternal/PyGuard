  "purpose": "Type aliases and data structures for time intervals, including time index types and interval representations.",
  "sources": "No untrusted input, data reading, or external data sources involved.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, external communications, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Static type definitions without data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of function and variable names; deprecated module import with warning.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several type aliases and a data class for time intervals using a custom function that creates new types with optional documentation and aliases. It imports from a deprecated module, issuing a warning, but does not perform any data processing, I/O, or network activity. The obfuscated naming could be for internal code generation or concealment but does not indicate malicious intent. No dynamic code execution, external data handling, or suspicious patterns are present. The static nature and lack of external interactions suggest the code is benign, serving primarily as type setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static setup of type aliases and data structures with high obfuscation but no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation alone does not imply malicious intent, and the absence of dynamic or external operations indicates a low security risk. The overall assessment is that this code is benign, likely auto-generated or for internal use, with no immediate security threats.",
