  "purpose": "Utilities for merging multiple sorted data streams with optional custom sorting, using heapq.merge and dynamic method modifications.",
  "sources": "External 'creek.util' functions, class attributes, input streams in streams_map",
  "sinks": "Data flows into heapq.merge, no external data leaks or system effects observed",
  "flows": "Streams from streams_map are combined via product, then merged with heapq.merge using a dynamic sort key",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, dynamic method wrapping, external 'creek.util' dependencies, use of partial and class method decoration",
  "analysis": "The code manages sorted data streams with dynamic method modifications and obfuscated identifiers. No explicit malicious payloads or network activity are present. External dependencies ('creek.util') and obfuscated naming could be used to hide malicious intent, but no evidence supports this. The malware score is low (0.0-0.2), and obfuscation is moderate. The dynamic modifications and external dependencies warrant cautious review but do not confirm malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for managing sorted data streams, with obfuscation and dynamic method modifications that could be exploited if misused. No direct malicious activity is evident, but the obfuscation and external dependencies justify a cautious security assessment.",
