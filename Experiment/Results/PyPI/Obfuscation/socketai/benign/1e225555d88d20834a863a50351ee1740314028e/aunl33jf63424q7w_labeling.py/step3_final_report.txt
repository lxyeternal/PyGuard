{
  "purpose": "Framework supporting multi-labels, with discussion on semantic clarity and flexible container types for data annotation.",
  "sources": "Class constructors, method calls, and internal data structures; no external or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "Labels added via methods like add_label, stored in memory; no external data leaks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input elements flow into label containers through method calls; no external data flow or network transmission.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic partial functions and placeholder obfuscated text ('FjksOswsxFLRcvILpLlZiIUnUZtpUiFY') indicating placeholder or incomplete documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a flexible labeling system with support for multiple container types, using standard class inheritance, partial functions, and in-memory data structures. No suspicious patterns, malicious code, or external data leaks are present. The placeholder text suggests obfuscation or incomplete documentation, not malicious intent. The use of tuples for annotations and label containers is standard. No security vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, flexible data labeling framework with no evidence of malicious activity. The high obfuscation score in report 5 is justified by placeholder content, not malicious intent. Overall, the code poses no security risk.",
