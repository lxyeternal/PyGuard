  "sources": "The code may read input from environment variables, configuration files, or user input, but since no code is provided, specific sources cannot be identified.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include network requests, file writes, or executing system commands, but no concrete sink points are visible without the actual code.",
  "flows": "Data flow from sources to sinks cannot be mapped without actual code content; hence, no source-to-sink paths can be identified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are identifiable without the code content.",
  "analysis": "Unable to perform a step-by-step analysis due to the absence of the code fragment. Review cannot proceed without actual code input.",
  "conclusion": "Insufficient information to determine the purpose, behavior, or security implications of the code. Cannot identify malicious behavior or security risks without the code.",
