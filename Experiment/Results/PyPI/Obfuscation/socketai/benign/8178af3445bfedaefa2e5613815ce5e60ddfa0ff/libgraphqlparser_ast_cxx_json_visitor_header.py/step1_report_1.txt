  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a specific task based on user input or data processing, possibly related to data transformation or communication with external services.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, user input, or external API responses.",
  "sinks": "Potential data outputs such as network requests, file writes, or console output.",
  "flows": "Data from sources flows into processing functions, which may then send data to sinks such as network or file systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code constructs detected; code appears standard with normal library usage. No obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is examined for typical security risks: no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious network connections, no dynamic code execution, and no unusual data leaks. It utilizes standard libraries and has a straightforward flow. No anomalies such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or cryptomining activities are evident. The structure suggests typical application logic without hidden malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not exhibit signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a normal, benign implementation suitable for its described purpose.",
