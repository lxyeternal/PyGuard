  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a standard Python script or module, but without specific comments or documentation, the intent is unclear. It might be for data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are not explicitly present; if any, they could be environment variables, user inputs, or external files, but none are clearly shown in the provided code snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include network connections, file writes, or environment variable manipulations, but no explicit I/O operations are visible in the code snippet provided.",
  "flows": "Without concrete input sources or sink operations, flow analysis is limited. No untrusted data flow paths are evident from the code provided.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscation, or unusual code patterns are present. The code appears straightforward and conventional in structure.",
  "analysis": "The code lacks obvious input handling, output, or external interactions. There are no signs of malicious activities such as data exfiltration, network communication, or privilege escalation. The structure and syntax are normal, with no signs of obfuscation or malware. The overall security risk is minimal based on this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears benign with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. It is a typical, straightforward Python script with no suspicious behaviors detected. Due to limited context, confidence is high that there is no malicious activity.",
