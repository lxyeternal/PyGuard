{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class that outputs static license comments and a C++ code snippet, with obfuscated import names and minimal logic.",
  "sources": "Imports from modules with obfuscated or non-standard names; static print statement.",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs static content; no untrusted data or external inputs.",
  "flows": "Static data flows from the print statement; no dynamic or untrusted data sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated import names, minimal logic, printing static code snippets, potential code obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, obfuscated, and only outputs static license and C++ code snippets. No dynamic data, network activity, or malicious behavior is evident. The obfuscation and static output suggest possible auto-generation or concealment but do not indicate malicious intent. The lack of external inputs or dynamic code execution reduces the risk profile. The import obfuscation and static print are suspicious but not malicious. The scores should reflect low malware and security risk, with obfuscation acknowledged.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears obfuscated and possibly auto-generated but shows no active malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The static output and lack of dynamic or network activity suggest a low threat level. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not constitute malicious intent.",
