{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a simple utility or script, potentially for data processing or network communication, but the specific purpose cannot be definitively identified due to the lack of context.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from environment variables, function parameters, or external files; possibly gathers system information or user input.",
  "sinks": "Potentially outputs data to the console, logs, or network connections; uses functions that send data externally or write to files.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (environment, files, parameters) through processing functions, potentially ending in output functions such as network requests or file writes.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation detected. However, unusual dynamic code execution or obfuscated patterns are not present. No suspicious network domains or data leaks are evident from the provided snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward functions and data handling routines. It does not show signs of malicious behavior such as sending system data over the network, accessing sensitive info without clearance, or executing hidden commands. Usage of third-party libraries appears benign. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent based on the visible content. Without additional context or hidden code, the likelihood of malicious activity is low.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no clear indications of malicious behavior, malware, or significant security risks. The code appears to be a standard, non-malicious utility script. However, due to limited context, this assessment carries a moderate confidence level.",
  "confidence": 0.7,
