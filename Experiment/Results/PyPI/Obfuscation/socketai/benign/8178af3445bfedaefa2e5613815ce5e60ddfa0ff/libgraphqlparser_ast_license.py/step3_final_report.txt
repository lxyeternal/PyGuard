  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks based on provided code descriptions.",
  "sources": "Input data variables, environment variables, network requests, file operations, or data processing functions.",
  "sinks": "External network endpoints, file outputs, environment variables, or data storage points where untrusted data could leak or cause effects.",
  "flows": "Input sources to sinks via data processing or transmission functions, such as reading input, processing, then sending data externally.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, suspicious network activity, dynamic code execution, or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code descriptions across all reports indicate straightforward data processing with no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious network activity. External data transmission is noted but without evidence of malicious intent. Confidence levels are high where code is simple, and no anomalies are detected. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1-0.4) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No evidence suggests malicious behavior or obfuscation, and the moderate security risk primarily relates to external data transmission concerns, not malicious sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "All reports accurately assess the code as benign with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The security risk scores are appropriate, reflecting minimal threat primarily due to external data transmission. The overall evaluation confirms the code is safe for use, with no immediate security concerns.",
