  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be a Python package intended for general use, possibly providing some functionality that involves input/output or processing, but no specific purpose can be conclusively determined without seeing the actual implementation.",
  "sources": "Potential sources include any input functions, environment variables, or external data reads such as files, network calls, or user input mechanisms. As the code content is not provided, specific sources cannot be identified.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network transmissions, file writes, system commands, or data storage points where untrusted data might be processed or transmitted. Specific sinks cannot be identified without the code content.",
  "flows": "Data flow from sources to sinks would indicate potential security issues if untrusted input is used unsanitized at sink points. Since the code is not provided, such flows cannot be explicitly identified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns can be identified without the actual code content. The prompt indicates a need to review all parts of the code carefully, but no code snippets are provided.",
  "analysis": "Due to the absence of actual code, a detailed step-by-step analysis cannot be performed. Normally, this would involve checking for hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, dynamic code execution, or other malicious indicators. Without code, these checks cannot be executed.",
  "conclusion": "No code provided for review; therefore, no malicious behavior or security risks can be identified at this time. The analysis is inconclusive without concrete code samples.",
