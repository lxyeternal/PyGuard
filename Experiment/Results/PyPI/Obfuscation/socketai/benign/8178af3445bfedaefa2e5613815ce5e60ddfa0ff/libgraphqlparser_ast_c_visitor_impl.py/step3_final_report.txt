  "purpose": "Analyze the provided Python code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Code reading input data, environment variables, network requests, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), hardcoded secrets.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file operations, dynamic code execution, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Input data or environment variables to network requests or code execution points, potentially leading to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation techniques, use of eval()/exec() on untrusted data, hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, unusual code structure.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and hardcoded secrets, which are red flags for malicious intent. Network activity to suspicious domains further supports this. The scores assigned (malware 0.7, obfuscated 0.8, risk 0.8) are justified given these indicators. Other reports lack code or describe benign scripts, warranting zero scores. The benign report's minimal risk score (0.1) could be adjusted to zero for consistency. Overall, the scores align with the evidence, with Report 1 showing high suspicion and others being safe.",
  "conclusion": "Report 1 indicates high likelihood of malicious or risky behavior due to obfuscation and insecure practices, warranting high malware and risk scores. Other reports are correctly scored as benign or lacking data. The scores are consistent with the described code and anomalies.",
