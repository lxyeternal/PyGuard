{
  "purpose": "This code is a minimal placeholder script containing only a shebang line, serving as an entry point or stub with no executable logic.",
  "sources": "The shebang line itself (`#!/usr/bin/env python`), which indicates the interpreter but does not read external input or data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process or output data, nor does it interact with external systems.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks, as the code contains only a shebang line with no further logic.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code beyond the shebang line; no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal script with only a shebang line, serving as a placeholder or default script. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the content. No anomalies or suspicious features are detected. The code does not perform any operations or data handling, thus posing no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, containing only a shebang line with no executable logic or security concerns. All reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are justified. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
