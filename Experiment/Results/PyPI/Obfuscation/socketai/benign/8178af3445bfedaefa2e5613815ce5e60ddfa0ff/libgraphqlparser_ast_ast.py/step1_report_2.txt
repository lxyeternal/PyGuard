  "purpose": "The script is a simple Python script with no explicit functionality or logic provided.",
  "sources": "No input or data sources are present in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in the provided code.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists due to the absence of code logic or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of a shebang line with no additional logic or content; this is unusual but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script contains only a shebang line ('#!/usr/bin/env python') without any further code, functions, or statements. This minimal content is typical for a script that is intended to be executed directly but provides no operational functionality. Since there are no data sources, sinks, or executable logic, there are no security issues, malicious behaviors, or anomalies beyond the trivial presence of a shebang line.",
  "conclusion": "The code is an empty Python script with only a shebang line; it does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a placeholder or a minimal script setup.",
