  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their assessments with the code and considering the scores.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a build script with heavily obfuscated function and variable names.\n- It performs filesystem checks, directory changes, and runs 'cmake' and 'make' via subprocess.\n- It moves the resulting shared library into a specific directory.\n- No direct evidence of malicious activity (e.g., network activity, data exfiltration, backdoors) is present.\n- The obfuscation is suspicious and could be used to hide malicious intent, but the code's apparent purpose is legitimate: building a native library.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose:** Build and place `libgraphqlparser`.\n- **Analysis:** Recognizes obfuscation and suspicious naming but finds no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Risk 0.2, Obfuscated 0.8, Confidence 0.7.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable. The low malware score aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose:** Setup script for compiling `libgraphqlparser`.\n- **Analysis:** Similar to Report 1, suspicious naming but no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Risk 0.2, Obfuscated 0.8, Confidence 0.7.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose:** Building a C extension for the package.\n- **Analysis:** Same pattern—obfuscated but no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0.2, Risk 0.4, Obfuscated 0.8, Confidence 0.6.\n\n**Note:** The malware score is slightly higher here (0.2), possibly due to the obfuscation, but no actual malicious behavior is evident.\n\n**Verdict:** Slightly cautious but still reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose:** Part of setup for building C extensions.\n- **Analysis:** Similar observations—obfuscation, no malicious payloads.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Risk 0.1, Obfuscated 0.8, Confidence 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** The low malware score and high confidence in benign intent are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose:** Build and compile `libgraphqlparser`.\n- **Analysis:** Obfuscated but no malicious signs.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Risk 0.2, Obfuscated 1, Confidence 0.75.\n\n**Note:** Obfuscation is marked as maximum (1), which is consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of findings:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is primarily a build script with obfuscation.\n- No report indicates actual malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors.\n- The malware scores are low (0 or 0.2), reflecting suspicion but no evidence.\n- The obfuscation scores are high (0.8 or 1), which is justified given the function names.\n- The security risk scores are moderate, mainly due to obfuscation rather than malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — no evidence of malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.9 — heavily obfuscated code.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — moderate due to obfuscation, but the actual code appears benign.\n\n**Final justification:**\n\nThe code's primary function is to automate building a native library, which is common in many projects. The obfuscation is suspicious but not conclusive of malicious intent. The subprocess calls lack error handling, which could be a security concern if malicious commands were injected, but as-is, they perform standard build steps.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The reports are consistent with each other.\n- The scores are appropriate given the evidence.\n- No changes needed; the assessments align well with the code's behavior.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n\n- Keep malware score at 0.\n- Maintain high obfuscation score.\n- Keep risk score low but mindful of obfuscation's potential to hide malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Metric             | My estimate |\n|--------------------|--------------|\n| Malware            | 0.0          |\n| Obfuscated         | 0.9          |\n| Security risk      | 0.2          |\n\nThe code appears to be a legitimate build script with obfuscation, not malicious.",
