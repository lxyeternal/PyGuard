  "purpose": "Build and place libgraphqlparser shared library into the project directory, automating compilation via obfuscated functions.",
  "sources": "Filesystem checks for existing libraries, directory change, subprocess calls to 'cmake' and 'make', renaming of output files.",
  "sinks": "Renaming of build artifacts into project directories; subprocess execution without error handling.",
  "flows": "Filesystem existence checks -> directory change -> subprocess build commands -> renaming output files.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of function and variable names, subprocess calls without error handling, no validation of build success.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard build steps for a native library, but obfuscation and lack of error handling are suspicious. No network activity or malicious payloads are evident. The subprocess calls could be exploited if environment is compromised, but as-is, they serve a typical build purpose. The obfuscation may hide malicious intent, but no evidence supports this. The scores assigned in reports (malware 0, high obfuscation) are consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a likely legitimate build process with significant obfuscation. No malicious activity is demonstrated. The high obfuscation warrants caution, but the code appears benign. Overall, the risk is low, with a malware score of 0 and an obfuscation score around 0.8.",
