  "conclusion": "Most reports are consistent with their descriptions; the primary adjustment is increasing report 4's malware score from 0.2 to 0.4 to account for embedded secrets and network activity. The overall assessment indicates moderate suspicion but no confirmed malicious payloads. Scores are justified and aligned with the evidence."
