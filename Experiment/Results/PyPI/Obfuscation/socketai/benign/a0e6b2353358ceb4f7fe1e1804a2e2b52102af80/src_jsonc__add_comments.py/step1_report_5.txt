  "purpose": "The code appears to perform standard data processing and possibly interacts with external systems or user inputs, but the specific purpose is not explicitly clear from the provided snippet.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly shown; potential sources could include environment variables, user inputs, or external data files if present in the complete code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or system commands if such code exists further in the code base. No explicit sink identified in the provided fragment.",
  "flows": "Without explicit code, flow analysis cannot definitively identify source-to-sink paths. No suspicious data flows are evident from the snippet provided.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code constructs, or unusual behaviors are detected in the visible code segment. Lack of context limits full analysis.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be straightforward, utilizing common Python constructs and third-party libraries in a typical manner. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns are visible. As the snippet is minimal and lacks clear malicious indicators, it is likely benign. The absence of explicit data handling or external communication reduces immediate concern. However, the analysis is limited by the lack of full code context.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code fragment, there are no evident signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears standard and free of anomalies or malware indicators. A more comprehensive review would require the full code to identify hidden or subtle malicious activities.",
