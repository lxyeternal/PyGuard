  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static data structure with non-standard comments. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The minor concern is the invalid JSON comments, which do not pose security threats but could affect parsing in strict JSON environments. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
