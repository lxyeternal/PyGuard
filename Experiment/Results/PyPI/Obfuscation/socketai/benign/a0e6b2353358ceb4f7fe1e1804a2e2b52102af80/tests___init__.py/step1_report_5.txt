{
  "purpose": "The code appears to implement a utility or library functions, but without seeing specific functionality, the purpose cannot be definitively determined.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function inputs, environment variables, and possibly from external modules or files.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communication functions, file writing, or execution of dynamic code, if present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions to output or external communication points.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected. However, without the actual code, the assessment is limited.",
  "analysis": "Since the code was not provided, this analysis is based on the general instructions. Normally, I would review the code for input handling, suspicious API usage, dynamic execution, network activity, and hardcoded secrets. As no specific code is available, no explicit flows or anomalies can be identified. The lack of visible suspicious patterns suggests a low likelihood of malicious intent, but this conclusion is tentative without actual code review.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of visible malicious patterns and anomalies, the code appears benign. However, the lack of actual code content limits the certainty of this assessment.",
