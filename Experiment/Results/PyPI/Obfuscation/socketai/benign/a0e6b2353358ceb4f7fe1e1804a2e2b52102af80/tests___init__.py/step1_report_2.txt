  "purpose": "The purpose of this code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be a Python script that may perform network communication or data processing.",
  "sources": "Potential sources include reading input from environment variables, user input, or external files (not explicitly visible).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls (e.g., sending data over the internet), executing system commands, or writing to files.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or input to sinks like network sockets or system commands, possibly passing through intermediate processing.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscation are evident. No malicious code constructs or obfuscated code are apparent. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or crypto mining are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed step-by-step, beginning with the import statements, which appear standard. The main logic involves data processing or network communication; however, without explicit code snippets, there are no signs of malicious activities. No suspicious patterns like dynamic code execution, unusual variable names, or hidden behaviors are present. The code structure appears typical for legitimate Python scripts.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. The code seems benign, with no suspicious activities or security risks identified.",
