  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate media metadata API client with heavy obfuscation. There is no direct evidence of malicious activity, but the obfuscation warrants further review. The low malware score (~0.2) is appropriate, while the high obfuscation score (~0.7) reflects the suspicious naming. The overall security risk remains low (~0.3), but ongoing monitoring and broader context review are recommended."
