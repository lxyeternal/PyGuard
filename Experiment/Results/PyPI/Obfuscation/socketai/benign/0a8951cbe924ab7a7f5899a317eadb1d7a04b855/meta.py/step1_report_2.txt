{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes and methods for fetching and processing media metadata, including cast and crew information, from an external session-based API.",
  "sources": "Data is read from external API responses via the session.get method calls within class methods. Input parameters like media_type, douban_id, tmdb_id, and season_number serve as data sources.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, the data fetched from the API could be used to instantiate objects or returned to callers, but there are no apparent sinks that perform unsafe operations such as executing untrusted code, writing to files, or network connections initiated by untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to make API GET requests; the responses are parsed and instantiated into objects or returned directly. The flow is: parameters -> API call -> response data -> object instantiation or return.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, suspicious dynamic code executions, or unusual code structures. The use of utils.whlEwQqiRXnHhXXzngSqyWvQeokiwyZs appears to process data but is an abstracted utility function; without further info, it does not seem malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily interacts with an external API via a session object. The session.get calls fetch data based on identifiers and media types. The data is then processed into class instances, with no indication of data being used maliciously. There are no signs of code injection, data leakage, or covert data exfiltration. The utility functions are abstracted but do not exhibit suspicious behavior. The code structure is straightforward and adheres to common API interaction patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate API wrapper designed for retrieving media metadata, with no evident malicious or sabotage behavior. It uses external inputs for API calls but does not perform any unsafe operations or exhibit malicious intent based on this review.",
