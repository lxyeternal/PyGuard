  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a dependency injection setup with heavy obfuscation, typical for complex modular applications. There is no direct evidence of malicious activity. While obfuscation raises suspicion, it does not confirm malicious intent. The low malware score and moderate risk score are justified. Continuous monitoring of the imported modules and runtime behavior is recommended to ensure no hidden malicious actions are present."
