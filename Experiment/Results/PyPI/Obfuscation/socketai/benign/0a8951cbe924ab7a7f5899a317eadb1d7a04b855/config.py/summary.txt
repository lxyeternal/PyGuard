  "conclusion": "The code appears to be obfuscated configuration management logic without evidence of malicious activity. The high obfuscation scores are justified, but no signs of malware or malicious intent are detected. The overall security risk is moderate (~0.2-0.3), primarily due to obfuscation, but the malware score remains at 0.0. Continuous monitoring is recommended to ensure no malicious payloads are hidden elsewhere."
