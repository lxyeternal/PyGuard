      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a dependency injection setup with heavy obfuscation, typical for complex modular applications. There is no direct evidence of malicious activity. While obfuscation raises suspicion, it does not confirm malicious intent. The low malware score and moderate risk score are justified. Continuous monitoring of the imported modules and runtime behavior is recommended to ensure no hidden malicious actions are present."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate media metadata API client with heavy obfuscation. There is no direct evidence of malicious activity, but the obfuscation warrants further review. The low malware score (~0.2) is appropriate, while the high obfuscation score (~0.7) reflects the suspicious naming. The overall security risk remains low (~0.3), but ongoing monitoring and broader context review are recommended."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, albeit heavily obfuscated, TMDB API client with no evidence of malicious activity. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. The malware score should remain at 0, and the overall security risk is low. The obfuscation score is justified given the naming conventions."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a plugin management component with heavy obfuscation. No direct malicious activity is evident, but the obfuscation and unusual import attributes warrant cautious handling. The low malware score (0.2) and high obfuscation score (0.8) are appropriate, with a moderate security risk (0.4) due to potential concealment. Further investigation into the imported modules and runtime behavior is recommended before deployment or trust."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be part of a legitimate media management system employing obfuscation, which warrants caution. No evidence of malware or malicious payloads is present. The primary concern is the obfuscation and network interactions that could be exploited if inputs are malicious. Monitoring and further validation of the external API endpoints and input sanitization are recommended."

      "conclusion": "The code is primarily an obfuscated event publisher with no direct evidence of malicious activity. The high obfuscation raises suspicion, but without additional context or dynamic analysis, malicious intent cannot be confirmed. The scores assigned are appropriate, with low malware likelihood, high obfuscation, and moderate security risk. Continued monitoring and further analysis of the session method are advised."

Obfuscation is notable but not inherently malicious; further static or dynamic analysis is recommended if needed."

The primary security concern is the obfuscation and absence of data validation, which could conceal malicious behavior if the data source is compromised. The overall security risk is moderate, but no malware or malicious code is detected in this snippet."

The high obfuscation scores are justified, but no signs of malware or malicious intent are detected. The overall security risk is moderate (~0.2-0.3), primarily due to obfuscation, but the malware score remains at 0.0. Continuous monitoring is recommended to ensure no malicious payloads are hidden elsewhere."
