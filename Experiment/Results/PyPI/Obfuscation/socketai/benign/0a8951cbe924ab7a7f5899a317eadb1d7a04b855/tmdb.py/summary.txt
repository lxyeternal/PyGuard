  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, albeit heavily obfuscated, TMDB API client with no evidence of malicious activity. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. The malware score should remain at 0, and the overall security risk is low. The obfuscation score is justified given the naming conventions."
