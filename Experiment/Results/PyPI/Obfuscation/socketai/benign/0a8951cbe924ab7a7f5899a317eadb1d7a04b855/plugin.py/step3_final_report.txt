  "purpose": "Manage plugin data by retrieving a list of installed plugins from a session object and instantiating plugin representations.",
  "sources": "session.get('plugins.get_installed_list')",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data leaks or harmful effects directly observable",
  "flows": "Data flows from session.get() into plugin class instantiation",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of class names, variable names, import attributes, and function names; use of obscure attribute 'oZkYMQcdEiHxiEpcXtithJXuvslmrTcX'",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for plugin management, heavily obfuscated to conceal intent. It retrieves plugin data via a session GET request and creates plugin objects. No malicious actions such as data exfiltration, code injection, or system modification are visible. The obfuscation and suspicious import attribute suggest potential concealment but do not confirm malicious intent. The utility function called is also obfuscated, raising suspicion but without further context. The data flow is straightforward and does not indicate malicious activity. The overall structure appears consistent with plugin management, with obfuscation likely used to hide the code's true purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a plugin management component with heavy obfuscation. No direct malicious activity is evident, but the obfuscation and unusual import attributes warrant cautious handling. The low malware score (0.2) and high obfuscation score (0.8) are appropriate, with a moderate security risk (0.4) due to potential concealment. Further investigation into the imported modules and runtime behavior is recommended before deployment or trust.",
