  "purpose": "A command-line utility that evaluates Python expressions or statements on input data, supporting dynamic module imports and flexible execution modes.",
  "sources": "Input files or stdin, from which code snippets or data are read for evaluation.",
  "sinks": "eval() and exec() functions where untrusted code is executed, and dynamic module importation based on user input.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into eval()/exec() calls, with module imports possibly influenced by user-specified parameters, leading to code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval() and exec() on untrusted input without sanitization, complex and obfuscated variable names, inconsistent code snippets, and dynamic imports that could be exploited.",
  "analysis": "The script evaluates arbitrary Python code provided via command-line options or input streams, using eval() and exec() functions that pose significant security risks. It supports dynamic module importing, which can be manipulated to load malicious modules. Variable names are obfuscated, and some code segments appear complex or incomplete, indicating possible obfuscation. The code lacks sanitization or sandboxing, making it vulnerable to code injection and malicious exploitation. The core pattern of executing untrusted code is inherently dangerous, especially in supply chain contexts. No explicit malware or backdoors are present, but the potential for malicious payloads exists if exploited.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly insecure due to its use of eval() and exec() on untrusted input, combined with dynamic imports and obfuscation. While not explicitly malicious, its design allows for malicious exploitation, warranting a very high security risk score. Obfuscation further raises suspicion. It should be considered dangerous and unsuitable for use in secure environments.",
