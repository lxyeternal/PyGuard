      "conclusion": "The code is highly insecure due to its use of eval() and exec() on untrusted input, combined with dynamic imports and obfuscation. While not explicitly malicious, its design allows for malicious exploitation, warranting a very high security risk score. Obfuscation further raises suspicion. It should be considered dangerous and unsuitable for use in secure environments."

      "obfuscated": 0.75,
      "confidence": 0.7,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious obfuscation and potential for dynamic code execution via an undefined function, raising moderate to high security concerns. While no explicit malicious payloads are present, the pattern warrants caution. The malware score is set at 0.6, reflecting suspicion of malicious intent, and the overall security risk is similarly elevated. Further investigation into the source and implementation of the undefined function is recommended before deployment or inclusion in supply chain dependencies."
