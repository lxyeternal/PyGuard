  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate test infrastructure with high obfuscation likely for placeholder or complexity reasons. There is no evidence of malicious payloads, sabotage, or supply chain compromise. The malware score is 0, the security risk is very low (~0.2), and the obfuscation level is high (~0.75), which is justified given the naming style."
