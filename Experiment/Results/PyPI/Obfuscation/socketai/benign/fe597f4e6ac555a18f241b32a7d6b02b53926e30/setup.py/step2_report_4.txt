  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a minimal, standard setup script for Python packaging.\n- No external input, dynamic code, or network activity is involved.\n- No hardcoded secrets, anomalies, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The code is straightforward and typical for its purpose.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of malicious behavior:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is consistent with the code being benign.\n   - No report suggests any malicious activity, backdoors, or payloads.\n\n2. **Obfuscation:**\n   - All reports assign obfuscated scores of 0, which is accurate given the code's clarity.\n\n3. **Security risk:**\n   - All reports assign very low or zero security risk scores, which is appropriate.\n   - Report 5 assigns a slightly higher securityRisk score of 0.1, but given the code's simplicity, this seems unjustified unless considering potential misconfigurations. However, since no actual vulnerability exists, this can be considered an overestimation.\n\n4. **Score justification:**\n   - The scores for malware and obfuscation are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - The overall security risk scores are also consistent, with the exception of report 5's 0.1, which appears slightly inflated.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- **Code presence:** The code is a standard, benign setup script.\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports, justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across all reports, justified.\n- **Risk score:** Should be close to 0, as no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are detected.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Security risk score:** 0\n\nThis code snippet is safe, typical, and contains no security concerns. The minor variation in report 5's securityRisk score (0.1) is unwarranted given the context.\n\n**Final note:** Always consider the context and code complexity. In this case, the code is straightforward, with no indication of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
