  "purpose": "This code is used for setting up a Python package using setuptools and pbr for configuration.",
  "sources": "The setup_requires argument and the import of setuptools are sources where the code reads input or data.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks of untrusted data or actions that could lead to data leaks or system effects are present.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves importing setuptools and calling setup() with configuration parameters, which are static and do not process untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors are present. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the setuptools library and calls setup() with setup_requires and pbr parameters, standard for packaging Python modules. There are no signs of malicious behavior, no dynamic code execution, data leaks, or suspicious logic. The code is typical for a package setup script and contains no malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It appears safe and typical for its purpose.",
