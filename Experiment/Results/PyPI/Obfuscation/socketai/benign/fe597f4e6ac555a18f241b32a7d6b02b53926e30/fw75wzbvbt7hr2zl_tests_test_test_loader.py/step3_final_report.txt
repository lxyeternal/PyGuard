{
  "purpose": "The code loads test resources and verifies their types, serving as a test harness with obfuscated identifiers.",
  "sources": "Import statements for test modules and resource classes, loading test resources via loadTestsFromName(__name__)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, external network, or file operations are present; no data leaks or malicious payloads detected.",
  "flows": "Test resource loading from module name to type assertion, with no external data flow or malicious control flow.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and class names, but superficial and consistent with test code; no suspicious code patterns or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard testing setup with obfuscated identifiers, performing resource loading and type assertions. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is evident. Obfuscation appears superficial, likely for concealment rather than malicious intent. Malware scores are zero, risk scores are low, and obfuscation scores are moderate to high due to naming. Overall, the code is benign, with no security threats or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated test harness with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are consistent with this assessment, with malware score at 0, obfuscation around 0.4, and low security risk (~0.1). No adjustments are necessary.",
