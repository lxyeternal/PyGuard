{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define some string variables, possibly for identification or metadata purposes, and imports everything from a local module.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded string literals assigned to variables.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data flows to external systems are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; variables are assigned static strings with no further use shown.",
  "anomalies": "The variables are named with seemingly random strings, which could indicate obfuscation, but no malicious indicators are evident. No sensitive data or hardcoded credentials are used in a suspicious context.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, with variable assignments that may serve as metadata or identifiers. The import statement imports all symbols from a local module, which is standard but can sometimes be suspicious if used improperly. No malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code execution, or obfuscated logic, is apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, mainly setting metadata variables and importing a module. No signs of malware or malicious intent are detected.",
