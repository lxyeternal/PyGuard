  "purpose": "Metadata containing author name, email, and version information for a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "Static string assignments to variables; import statement from local module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static data assigned to variables without processing.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; import from local module; no dynamic code or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static string assignments for author, email, and version, with obfuscated variable names, and a local import. No dynamic execution, network calls, or suspicious functions are present. The obfuscation appears superficial, likely stylistic, and does not indicate malicious intent. The import statement is standard in modular code but warrants context; here, it does not suggest malicious activity. The code functions as metadata or configuration, with no evident security risks or malware. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, risk=0.1-0.2, obfuscated=0.2-0.7) are consistent with the benign, metadata nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign metadata with superficial obfuscation and a standard import. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified based on the code's simplicity and lack of active threats.",
