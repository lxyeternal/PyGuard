{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define some module-level variables, likely metadata such as author name, email, and version.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements that assign string literals to variables",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks or data flows that could lead to data leaks or malicious activity",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only initializes variables",
  "anomalies": "Presence of seemingly random variable names that do not convey meaningful information; no security-sensitive operations observed; import statement importing from a relative module, but no context is provided to determine if it is malicious",
  "analysis": "The code initializes three variables with static strings, likely metadata. The variable names are obfuscated or randomly generated, which could be an attempt to conceal intent, but no malicious behavior is evident. The import statement suggests reliance on other code, but without further context, it is benign. No suspicious logic, data handling, or potentially harmful operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and only assigns static data to variables, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The variable naming may be obfuscated but does not indicate malicious behavior.",
