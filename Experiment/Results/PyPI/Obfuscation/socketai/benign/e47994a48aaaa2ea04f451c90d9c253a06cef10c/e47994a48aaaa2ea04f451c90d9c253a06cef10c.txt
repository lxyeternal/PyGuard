      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with obfuscated variable names. The obfuscation alone does not indicate malicious activity. The malware score is correctly 0, and the security risk is low (~0.1-0.2). The obfuscation warrants caution but does not constitute malicious behavior. Overall, the package appears safe, with no evidence of sabotage or malware."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, albeit heavily obfuscated, signaling utility with no evidence of malicious activity or payloads. Its obfuscation is likely stylistic or protective rather than malicious. The low malware and security risk scores are appropriate, with a high obfuscation score reflecting the variable naming."

The main concern is the obfuscation and the import of 'blinker_herald', which should be further scrutinized outside this context. Overall, the security risk is minimal, and the code can be considered safe."
