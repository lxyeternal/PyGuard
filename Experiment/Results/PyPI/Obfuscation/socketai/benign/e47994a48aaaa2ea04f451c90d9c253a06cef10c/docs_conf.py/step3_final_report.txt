  "purpose": "Configuration setup for documentation generation, involving module imports and variable definitions.",
  "sources": "os.getcwd(), os.path.dirname(), import blinker_herald",
  "sinks": "None; static configuration with no data leaks or untrusted input handling",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; primarily variable assignments",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, import of 'blinker_herald' which could be suspicious but no malicious activity evident",
  "analysis": "The code is a static configuration script for documentation, with obfuscated variable names. It imports a module named 'blinker_herald' but does not perform any network activity, data processing, or dynamic code execution. The variable names are nonsensical, which is suspicious but not malicious. No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks, and no malicious code is present. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not indicate malicious intent. The scores reflect low malware likelihood (0), low security risk (~0.2), and high obfuscation (around 0.7).",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign configuration code with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malware or malicious behavior. The main concern is the obfuscation and the import of 'blinker_herald', which should be further scrutinized outside this context. Overall, the security risk is minimal, and the code can be considered safe.",
