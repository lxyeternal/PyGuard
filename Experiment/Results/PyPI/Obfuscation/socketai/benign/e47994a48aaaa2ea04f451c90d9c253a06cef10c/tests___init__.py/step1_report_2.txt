{
  "purpose": "The provided code snippet appears to be a minimal header indicating the file encoding, likely used as a placeholder or part of a larger script.",
  "sources": "No data sources, input reads, or external data dependencies are present in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, outputs, or potential points of data exfiltration are present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are observable, as the code contains only a file encoding declaration.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a coding declaration and no executable logic; no anomalies, malicious behaviors, or obfuscated code are evident.",
  "analysis": "This code fragment is merely a file encoding declaration (`# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-`) with no functional code. It does not perform any operations, read input, write output, or execute logic. As such, it cannot contain malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be a standard header comment often used in Python scripts to specify source encoding.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless and non-malicious, serving solely as a file encoding declaration. No security risks or malware are detected in this fragment.",
