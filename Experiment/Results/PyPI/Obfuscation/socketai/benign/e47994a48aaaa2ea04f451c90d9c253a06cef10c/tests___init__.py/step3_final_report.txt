  "purpose": "This code snippet serves as a Python file encoding declaration, specifying UTF-8 encoding.",
  "sources": "No data sources; the code is a comment line with no input reading.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; there are no data flows or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code contains only a comment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a standard encoding comment with no suspicious or malicious elements.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single comment line specifying UTF-8 encoding (`# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-`). It contains no executable code, functions, data processing, or external interactions. There are no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors. The reports correctly identify the benign nature of this snippet, with high confidence. Scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the code content. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are present. The code is a standard practice in Python scripts and poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard encoding declaration with no malicious intent or security risk. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted.",
