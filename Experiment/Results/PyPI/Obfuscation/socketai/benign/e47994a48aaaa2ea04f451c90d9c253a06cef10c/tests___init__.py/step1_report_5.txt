  "purpose": "No purpose is defined; the code contains only a file encoding declaration.",

  "anomalies": "The code contains only a shebang line declaring UTF-8 encoding; no anomalies, suspicious activity, or malicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is an extremely minimal fragment, consisting solely of a coding declaration comment. It does not perform any operations, read input, process data, or contain any logic. Since there is no executable code, no data sources, sinks, or flows are detectable. The absence of any logic or external interactions indicates that there are no security concerns or malicious behaviors embedded in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is benign, serving only to specify the source file encoding. There are no malicious behaviors, no security risks, and no suspicious patterns identified.",
