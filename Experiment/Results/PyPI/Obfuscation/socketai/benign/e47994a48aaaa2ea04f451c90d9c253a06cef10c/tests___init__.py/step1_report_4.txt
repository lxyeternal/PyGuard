  "purpose": "No specific purpose can be determined as the code is only a comment line indicating UTF-8 encoding and contains no executable logic.",
  "sources": "No data sources, inputs, or data reading operations present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, output, or potential data leak points present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths due to absence of executable code.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of only a UTF-8 encoding declaration comment; no anomalies or suspicious code elements.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a single line specifying UTF-8 encoding, which is a standard comment in Python files and does not execute or import any modules. No input/output, data handling, or logic exists to analyze further. As such, there are no security concerns or malicious indicators in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a minimal file encoding declaration with no executable content, no malicious behavior, and no security risks detected.",
