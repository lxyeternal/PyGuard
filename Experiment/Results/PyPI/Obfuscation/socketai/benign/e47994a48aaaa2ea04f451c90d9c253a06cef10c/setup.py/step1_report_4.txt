  "purpose": "Setup configuration script for a Python package named 'm2l1hrr7k298ho1u'.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' and 'HISTORY.rst' files, defining package data and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks, but the setup parameters could influence package behavior.",
  "flows": "Reading files -> configuring setup parameters -> package installation.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, inconsistent formatting, and potential misconfiguration in setup parameters. No explicit hardcoded secrets or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily loads README and HISTORY files to include in package metadata, defines dependencies, and configures package setup parameters. Variable names are intentionally obfuscated, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No suspicious network activity, code injection, or backdoors are present. The setup script appears to be a standard package configuration with some obfuscation or code scrambling, possibly for hiding intent or for aesthetic reasons. No malicious payloads or security risks identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard Python package setup script with obfuscated variable names. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are present based on the provided content.",
