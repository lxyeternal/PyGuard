  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with obfuscated variable names. The obfuscation alone does not indicate malicious activity. The malware score is correctly 0, and the security risk is low (~0.1-0.2). The obfuscation warrants caution but does not constitute malicious behavior. Overall, the package appears safe, with no evidence of sabotage or malware."
