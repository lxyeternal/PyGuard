{
  "purpose": "This code implements a signaling utility with optional 'blinker' support, providing decorators to emit signals before and after function execution, with heavy obfuscation and fallback classes when 'blinker' is unavailable.",
  "sources": "Import statements, function definitions, and class initializations that read module imports, function arguments, and class attributes.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain explicit sinks such as network calls, file modifications, or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Function decorators invoke signal emission methods; signal handlers (if any) could be invoked via the wrapped functions, but no external data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of variable and function names, dynamic function wrapping, fallback classes raising errors if signaling is used without 'blinker'.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard signaling utility with optional dependency support, heavily obfuscated but structurally consistent. No malicious payloads, network activity, or data leaks are present. The obfuscation may hinder readability but does not imply malicious intent. The fallback classes are designed to prevent signaling if 'blinker' is missing, raising runtime errors, which is a common pattern. The dynamic decorators facilitate pre- and post-signal emission, typical in event-driven frameworks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, albeit heavily obfuscated, signaling utility with no evidence of malicious activity or payloads. Its obfuscation is likely stylistic or protective rather than malicious. The low malware and security risk scores are appropriate, with a high obfuscation score reflecting the variable naming.",
