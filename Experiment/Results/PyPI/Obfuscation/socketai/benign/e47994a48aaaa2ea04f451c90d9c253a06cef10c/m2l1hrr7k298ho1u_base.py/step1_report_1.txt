{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a signaling or event dispatching utility, possibly for a larger framework, involving signal registration and invocation, with optional support for the 'blinker' library.",
  "sources": "Imports 'inspect' and optionally 'blinker'; reads from function definitions, class attributes, and parameters; reads module-level variables and class instances.",
  "sinks": "Function calls, especially dynamically generated and wrapped functions, invoke signal emitters or handlers; potential for indirect code execution via dynamic attribute access.",
  "flows": "Sources such as function definitions and class instantiations flow into wrapper functions that invoke signal emitters; signal emitters are invoked with potentially untrusted data, but the actual emission depends on external signals.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable and function names, no clear hardcoded secrets or credentials, conditional import with fallback classes that raise runtime errors if 'blinker' is unavailable, dynamic wrapping of functions for signal emission. No malicious code like network connections, file modifications, or reverse shells detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines utility functions and classes for signaling, optionally using the 'blinker' library. When 'blinker' is not installed, it defines fallback classes that raise errors if signaling functions are called. The core function 'wzxnSvjQMHMDnucpPlPvytlmxzdBoOmS' wraps other functions to add pre- and post-signal dispatching behavior, using inspect to analyze call args and dynamically invoke signal handlers. No network activity, file manipulation, or suspicious operations are evident. Variable names are intentionally obfuscated, but the logic aligns with standard signal handling mechanisms. Overall, the code does not contain malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior. It appears to be a signal dispatch utility with obfuscation, likely part of a larger framework.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a complex, obfuscated signal handling utility, potentially designed for use in a framework that supports event signaling. There are no signs of malicious intent, data exfiltration, or system disruption activities. The obfuscation may hinder readability but does not imply malicious behavior.",
