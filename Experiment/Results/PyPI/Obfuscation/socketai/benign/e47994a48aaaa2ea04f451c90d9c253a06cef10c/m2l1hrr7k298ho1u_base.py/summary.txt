  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, albeit heavily obfuscated, signaling utility with no evidence of malicious activity or payloads. Its obfuscation is likely stylistic or protective rather than malicious. The low malware and security risk scores are appropriate, with a high obfuscation score reflecting the variable naming."
