{
  "purpose": "Defines classes for SVG or graphics elements such as gradients, clip paths, masks, filters, and markers, likely for rendering or styling purposes.",
  "sources": "Class constructors, method parameters, imported modules, class attributes",
  "sinks": "None detected; no external data, network, or system modifications observed",
  "flows": "Initialization of graphical properties, appending style objects, returning tuples or class instances",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with nonsensical class and variable names; no hardcoded secrets or external data handling",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple classes related to SVG or graphical elements, with obfuscated naming conventions. Methods perform straightforward operations such as setting properties, appending style objects, or returning tuples. No network activity, data leaks, or system modifications are present. The obfuscation appears to be for concealment rather than malicious intent. Scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0.0, risk: 0.1-0.2, obfuscation: ~0.75) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The code does not process untrusted input or perform any risky operations. Overall, the code is a graphics configuration library with high obfuscation but no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of SVG/graphics classes with obfuscated identifiers, serving legitimate rendering purposes. There is no evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious activity. The obfuscation likely aims to conceal implementation details but does not imply malicious intent. The scores (malware: 0.0, obfuscation: ~0.75, risk: ~0.2) are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
