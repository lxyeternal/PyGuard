  "conclusion": "The code is a set of SVG/graphics classes with obfuscated identifiers, serving legitimate rendering purposes. There is no evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious activity. The obfuscation likely aims to conceal implementation details but does not imply malicious intent. The scores (malware: 0.0, obfuscation: ~0.75, risk: ~0.2) are justified and consistent with the analysis."
