  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated utility for video processing and display, with no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain compromise. The high obfuscation score reflects naming obfuscation but does not indicate malicious intent. Malware score is 0, security risk is low (~0.2), and obfuscation is superficial."
