{
  "purpose": "Define classes for managing video processing and visualization, including saving outputs and displaying in Jupyter notebooks.",
  "sources": "Input parameters in class constructors, method arguments, environment for display functions.",
  "sinks": "File operations for saving video output, display functions for Jupyter notebooks, potential network communication (not present).",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters and method arguments to file writing and display functions; no evidence of malicious data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of lambda functions as default arguments, dynamic import of IPython display module within conditional block, generic class and method names, no hardcoded credentials or backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes for managing video output, with methods for saving files and displaying outputs in Jupyter notebooks. No suspicious network activity, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscated code detected. Use of lambda defaults and conditional IPython imports are typical patterns for interactive or notebook-based applications. The file operations and display functions appear to be part of intended functionality without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard for a video processing utility designed for Jupyter notebooks and file saving, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. No suspicious signals or malware signatures identified.",
