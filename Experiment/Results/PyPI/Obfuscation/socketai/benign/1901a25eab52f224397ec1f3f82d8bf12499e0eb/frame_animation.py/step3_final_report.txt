  "purpose": "Classes for managing video processing, display, and output, especially in Jupyter notebooks, with resource management and saving capabilities.",
  "sources": "External 'video' module functions, IPython.display functions, file input/output operations.",
  "sinks": "File system for saving videos, display output in notebooks.",
  "flows": "Methods invoke external video functions for saving/display, with no network or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Heavily obfuscated class and method names, use of lambda defaults, dynamic import of display functions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of utility classes for video handling, display, and saving, with context managers for resource management. No network activity, no hardcoded secrets, and no malicious code patterns are present. Obfuscation appears superficial, likely for code protection or minimization. The external 'video' module functions are called for file operations, and display functions are used for notebook visualization. No suspicious data flow or malicious payloads are detected. The obfuscation does not imply malicious intent, and the overall structure aligns with benign utility code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated utility for video processing and display, with no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain compromise. The high obfuscation score reflects naming obfuscation but does not indicate malicious intent. Malware score is 0, security risk is low (~0.2), and obfuscation is superficial.",
