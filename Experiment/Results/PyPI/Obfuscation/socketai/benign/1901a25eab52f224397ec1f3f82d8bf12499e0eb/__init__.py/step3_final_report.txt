{
  "purpose": "The code generates SVG graphics using an obfuscated custom library and 'drawsvg', performing drawing operations, saving SVG/PNG files, and rasterizing images without external data or network activity.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded drawing commands, variable assignments, and method calls within the script.",
  "sinks": "File system writes for SVG and PNG files, rasterization output, no network or external data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from drawing method calls and shape definitions to file outputs and rasterization functions, with no external input or untrusted data involved.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with nonsensical variable and method names, complex chaining of drawing commands, lack of input validation or external data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a heavily obfuscated SVG graphics generator, constructing various shapes, text, and configurations, then saving and rasterizing images. No network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications are evident. Obfuscation appears intended to conceal complexity but does not demonstrate malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.1, obfuscated ~0.8, risk ~0.2) are consistent with the analysis, reflecting suspicion due to obfuscation but no active malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a complex, obfuscated graphics generation tool with no evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware and risk scores should remain low, indicating a benign nature despite the obfuscation.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0.8,
