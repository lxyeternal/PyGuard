  "purpose": "Functions for exporting drawings as GIFs, videos, spritesheets, or bitmaps, converting drawing data into media formats.",
  "sources": "Input data from lists of Drawing objects or numpy arrays, reading from variables and parameters.",
  "sinks": "Output files or file-like objects where media is saved; potential for data leakage if inputs are malicious, but code itself is benign.",
  "flows": "Input data → processing (resizing, aligning, coloring) → media file writing via imageio or similar libraries.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are obfuscated or inconsistent, which may suggest obfuscation but no malicious code or secrets are present; no network activity or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard media export functions handling image and video data, with typical parameters for alignment, background, and format. No suspicious behaviors such as network connections, code injection, or data exfiltration are evident. Obfuscation appears limited to variable naming, not malicious obfuscation. The functions perform expected tasks with no signs of sabotage or malware. The overall structure and flow are straightforward, with no anomalies indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for exporting drawings as GIFs, videos, or spritesheets. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. Obfuscation is minimal and not indicative of malicious activity. The security risk is very low, primarily related to handling untrusted input data, which is typical for such functions.",
