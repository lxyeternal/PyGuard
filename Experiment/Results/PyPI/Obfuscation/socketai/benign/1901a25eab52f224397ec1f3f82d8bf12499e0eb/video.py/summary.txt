  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for exporting drawings as GIFs, videos, or spritesheets. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. Obfuscation is minimal and not indicative of malicious activity. The security risk is very low, primarily related to handling untrusted input data, which is typical for such functions."
