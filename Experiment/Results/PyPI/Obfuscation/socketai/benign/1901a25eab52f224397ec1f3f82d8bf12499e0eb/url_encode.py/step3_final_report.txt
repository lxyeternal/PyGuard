{
  "purpose": "The code encodes binary data into base64 data URIs, sanitizes input strings by removing specified characters, and constructs data URI strings for embedding images (likely SVGs).",
  "sources": "Input data provided to functions as parameters; regex pattern for sanitization; potentially external data if integrated into larger systems.",
  "sinks": "The constructed data URI strings could be used to embed content into web pages or applications; no direct data leaks or network transmissions are evident within this code fragment.",
  "flows": "Input data is sanitized via regex substitution, then encoded into base64, and finally assembled into a data URI string for embedding.",
  "anomalies": "Use of heavily obfuscated variable names; references to undefined variables ('mime', 'STRIP_CHARS', 'b64') indicating incomplete or intentionally obscured code; no comments or documentation; incomplete implementation details.",
  "analysis": "The functions perform data sanitization and encoding for embedding images, with obfuscated variable names and incomplete references suggesting either obfuscation or incomplete code snippets. No network activity, system modifications, or malicious payloads are present. The high obfuscation score reflects the difficulty in analyzing the code, but the lack of malicious actions or payloads indicates benign intent. The undefined variables point to incomplete code, not necessarily malicious. The overall behavior is consistent with utility functions for safe embedding of image data, not malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign utility functions for encoding and sanitizing image data for embedding, with obfuscation and incomplete segments that warrant cautious review but do not demonstrate malicious intent or malware. The low malware score and moderate security risk reflect this assessment.",
