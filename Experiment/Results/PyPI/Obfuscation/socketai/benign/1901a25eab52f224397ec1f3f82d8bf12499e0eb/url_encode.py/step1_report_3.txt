{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be processing SVG images, encoding data into base64, stripping certain characters from input text, and generating URI strings for embedding images.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions: mGCCkFmIOSlHosqtVOeshcOUHKHrYIyR, txt, and potentially external data passed into these functions.",
  "sinks": "Return statements that generate data URIs with base64-encoded content and modified text data, which could be used to embed images or manipulate SVG content.",
  "flows": "Input data (mGCCkFmIOSlHosqtVOeshcOUHKHrYIyR, txt) is processed through regex substitution or encoding functions, then embedded into data URI strings for use in web contexts.",
  "anomalies": "The variable names are obfuscated and do not clearly indicate purpose. There is an undefined variable 'STRIP_CHARS' used in the third function. The function docstring mentions escaping characters, but no explicit malicious logic or external network activity is present. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code injections are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code encodes input data into base64, strips specified characters using regex, and constructs data URIs for embedding images. The variable naming and structure are intentionally obfuscated, but no direct malicious activity, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or execution of untrusted code, is evident. The functions mainly manipulate and prepare data for embedding purposes. The undefined 'STRIP_CHARS' is an issue but not an indicator of malicious intent. Overall, the code appears to be focused on data processing and encoding without malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain malicious behavior or malware. Its purpose seems to be related to encoding and preparing SVG/image data for embedding, with obfuscated variable names but no active malicious operations.",
