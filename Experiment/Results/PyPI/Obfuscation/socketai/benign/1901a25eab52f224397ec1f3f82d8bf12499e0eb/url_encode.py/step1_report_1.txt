Text input is cleaned via regex (source), then re-encoded into data URIs (sink).\",\n  \"anomalies\": \"The code uses obfuscated variable names and functions with minimal comments, which is suspicious. The function 'mlBHmOkKasDCKYilUYfYugxhekkEHnkC' mentions escaping characters but does not perform actual URI encoding, potentially indicating obfuscation or incomplete logic. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code are evident. The code seems solely focused on encoding and cleaning data for data URI creation.\",\n  \"analysis\": \"The initial code defines a binary string and a function to encode input data into a data URI with base64. The 'RWGlYiydnCskMUMXtfNLuqMdwQGsNIdo' function encodes input data in base64 and constructs a data URI string. However, it references an undefined variable 'mime'—likely a typo or incomplete code. The 'ABKhKJfhzsWVohHrvLUGWLpmcgKLulpq' function removes specified 'strip_chars' from the input text using regex, then re-encodes the cleaned text into a data URI via the previous function. The third function 'mlBHmOkKasDCKYilUYfYugxhekkEHnkC' contains a docstring describing URI escaping, but its implementation is incomplete or missing, and it references an undefined variable 'STRIP_CHARS'. Overall, the code appears to be for encoding image data into data URIs after some cleaning, with obfuscated variable names and incomplete implementation details, but no clear malicious behavior such as network communication, data theft, or backdoors.',\n  \"conclusion\": \"The code is primarily for encoding and preparing data URIs, possibly for embedding images. It contains obfuscated identifiers and incomplete segments but shows no evidence of malicious intent or malware. Its purpose seems benign, with no signs of sabotage or harmful behavior.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.7,\n  \"obfuscated\": 0.8,\n  \"malware\": 0,\n  \"securityRisk\": 0.2\n}",
