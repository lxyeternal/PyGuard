{
  "purpose": "The code appears to process image data, encoding and sanitizing input data, likely for embedding images in SVG format or similar.",
  "sources": "Input data includes function parameters such as mGCCkFmIOSlHosqtVOeshcOUHKHrYIyR, txt, and other parameters passed into functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential sink includes the return statements where base64-encoded data URIs are generated; data could be used in contexts where untrusted content is embedded.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters, through sanitization (regex replacements and character encoding), then into base64 encoding, and finally into a data URI string.",
  "anomalies": "Code contains undefined variables like STRIP_CHARS, and the variable yWEWhhrzahoqsEcVXbodkxStbiNqQdFH is used without prior definition or validation, which may be an oversight. The code employs obfuscated variable names and convoluted functions, suggesting possible concealment.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple functions for data processing: one encodes data into base64 and constructs data URIs, another sanitizes input text via regex substitutions, and another prepares URI data without base64 encoding. There are no clear signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or system modification. The obfuscation of variable names and some undefined variables suggest an attempt to hide intent. However, there are no explicit malicious actions or suspicious data leaks evident in this fragment. The functions could be misused to embed malicious content if combined with malicious inputs, but on their own, they are primarily data processing utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily performs data encoding and sanitization related to embedding images, with obfuscated variable names and some undefined references. No direct malicious behavior or malware signatures are evident within this fragment. However, its obfuscation and lack of context warrant cautious review if used in a larger application.",
