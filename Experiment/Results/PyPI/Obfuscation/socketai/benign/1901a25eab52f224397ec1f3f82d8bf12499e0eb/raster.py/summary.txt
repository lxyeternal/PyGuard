  "conclusion": "The code shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, raising suspicion but lacking confirmed malicious payloads. Scores reflect moderate concern, with a malware score of 0.4, obfuscation at 0.8, and risk at 0.5. These are justified given the evidence. Further dynamic analysis is recommended to clarify malicious intent."
