  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code input, environment variables, network or file operations, dynamic execution points (eval/exec).",
  "sinks": "Network connections, environment variable access, file writes, data leaks, system modifications.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or user input flow into dynamic execution or network transmission sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, suspicious data flows, unusual imports.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are red flags for malicious intent. No concrete malicious payloads are confirmed; the obfuscation and dynamic code execution increase suspicion but do not definitively indicate malware. The absence of hardcoded secrets or suspicious network activity reduces immediate threat. The overall structure suggests potential for malicious behavior, warranting cautious scoring.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, raising suspicion but lacking confirmed malicious payloads. Scores reflect moderate concern, with a malware score of 0.4, obfuscation at 0.8, and risk at 0.5. These are justified given the evidence. Further dynamic analysis is recommended to clarify malicious intent.",
