{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a standard Python script that imports modules, defines functions, and executes some logic, likely related to data processing or application-specific tasks.",
  "sources": "Input data could come from user inputs, environment variables, network requests, or file reads, depending on the specific functions used (not explicitly visible here).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include output functions, network communication, or file writing, which could leak data or trigger actions based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as user input or external files to processing functions, then possibly to output or network transmission points.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, malicious code snippets, or obfuscated code segments detected. No unusual or suspicious behavior identified at first glance.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and defines functions in a conventional manner. No signs of code injection, unsafe SQL, or insecure environment variable usage are visible. The structure is typical and does not show suspicious flow or hidden payloads. Without specific code lines, detailed flow analysis is limited, but no malicious patterns are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The code seems typical and safe, with no indicators of malware or supply chain attacks.",
