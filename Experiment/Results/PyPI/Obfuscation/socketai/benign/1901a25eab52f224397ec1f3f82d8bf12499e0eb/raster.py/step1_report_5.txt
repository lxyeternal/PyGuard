  "purpose": "The code appears to initialize a web server and handle HTTP requests, likely for serving a web application or API.",
  "sources": "Input is read from HTTP request parameters and potentially environment variables for configuration.",
  "sinks": "Data is outputted to HTTP responses, and some operations involve system commands or file handling.",
  "flows": "HTTP request data flows into request handlers, possibly passing through environment variables, then to response output or system commands.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious domain connections, or unusual dynamic code execution observed. No obfuscated code features detected. Usage of standard libraries and practices.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a web server, handles incoming requests, and responds accordingly. It reads request parameters and environment variables, but there are no indications of malicious data handling or suspicious external connections. All functions and modules appear standard and appropriate for a web service. No backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are evident. The code does not demonstrate obfuscation or malicious behavior. It is a typical web server implementation without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code seems to be a standard web server setup without malicious behavior or security risks. No suspicious activity or malware features detected based on the provided code.",
