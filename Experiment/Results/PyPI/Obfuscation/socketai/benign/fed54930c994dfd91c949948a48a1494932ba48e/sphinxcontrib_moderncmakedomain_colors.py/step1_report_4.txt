  "purpose": "Define a custom syntax highlighting style for Pygments",
  "sources": "Imports from pygments.style and pygments.token, class definition with style attributes",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data; no external data or command execution",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static style definitions only",
  "anomalies": "Unusual class name (gGntPSfUPYGsLTASHYVxtodEXBilLdoU) which appears obfuscated or randomly generated; no other suspicious code or behavior",
  "analysis": "The code imports styling modules, defines a class with a complex, seemingly obfuscated name, and sets style attributes using fixed color values for syntax highlighting. No input handling, no external calls, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, or malicious logic observed. The naming may suggest obfuscation but appears to be a nonsensical or auto-generated identifier, not malicious per se.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely defines a syntax highlighting style with no malicious behavior. The unusual class name is likely obfuscation or random naming but does not indicate malicious intent. No security risks or malware are present.",
