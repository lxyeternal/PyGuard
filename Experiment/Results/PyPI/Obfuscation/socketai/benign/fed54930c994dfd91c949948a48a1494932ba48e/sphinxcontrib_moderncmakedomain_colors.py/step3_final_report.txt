  "purpose": "Static syntax highlighting style configuration for Pygments, defining color tokens with an obfuscated class name.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; static class attributes setting color values.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs involved.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration with no data flow or execution paths.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class name, which appears auto-generated or placeholder; no malicious code or dynamic behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class inheriting from Pygments' Style with static color assignments for syntax tokens. The class name is obfuscated, but this is common in auto-generated or placeholder code. There are no input sources, data sinks, or dynamic behaviors. No code injection, network activity, or malicious patterns are present. The style attributes are fixed strings, and the code is purely static configuration. No secrets, credentials, or backdoors are detected. The obfuscation is superficial and does not imply malicious intent. The malware score is appropriately 0, and the security risk score is also 0. The obfuscated score is moderate due to the class name's nonsensical nature but is justified as benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static syntax highlighting style definition with obfuscated naming, posing no security or malicious threat. The scores should reflect no malware (0), low obfuscation (around 0.3), and no security risk (0).",
