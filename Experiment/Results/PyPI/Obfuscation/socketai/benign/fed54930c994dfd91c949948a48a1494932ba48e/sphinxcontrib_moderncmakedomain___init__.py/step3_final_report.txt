{
  "purpose": "Minimal package metadata or initialization, importing an obfuscated symbol and defining version info.",
  "sources": "Import statement from local module (.cmake), assignment of version string.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "Import of obfuscated symbol; no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated import name, minimal code structure, reliance on external module without context.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a suspiciously named symbol from a local module, assigns a version string, and defines __all__. No network activity, data leaks, or dynamic behavior are present. The import name appears obfuscated, which could indicate obfuscation or hiding malicious code, but no direct malicious activity is evident. The code's simplicity suggests it functions as a metadata or version module. The obfuscation warrants further review of the imported module but does not confirm malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign in function but employs obfuscated naming, which raises suspicion. There is no evidence of malware or malicious behavior in this snippet. The primary concern is obfuscation, not active malicious activity. Further review of the imported module is recommended to rule out hidden threats.",
