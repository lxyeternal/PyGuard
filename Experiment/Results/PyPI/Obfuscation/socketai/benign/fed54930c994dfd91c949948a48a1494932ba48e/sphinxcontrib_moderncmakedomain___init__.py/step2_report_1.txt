  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet, the reported concerns, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is minimal, importing a symbol from a local module (.cmake), assigning a version string, and defining `__all__`.\n- The import name `YRaswXdsfeeuZFoQLHgsCYqZPPKUSbHE` appears obfuscated or nonsensical, which raises suspicion but does not, by itself, indicate malicious activity.\n- No data flows, network activity, or untrusted input handling are present.\n- The code structure resembles a typical package metadata or initialization file, not an attack vector.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- The import name is unusual and suspicious, but no evidence suggests it is malicious or harmful.\n- The code does not contain any direct malware, backdoors, or malicious logic.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- No functional errors are evident.\n- The main flaw is the obfuscated import name, which could hinder maintainability or indicate obfuscation.\n\n### Score review and justification:\n\n#### Malware Score:\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the analysis: no malicious behavior is evident.\n- Given the obfuscated import name alone, I agree with a malware score of **0**.\n\n#### Obfuscated Score:\n- The scores range from 0.5 to 0.7.\n- The obfuscation is consistent across reports and justified by the nonsensical symbol name.\n- I would assign an obfuscated score of **0.6** overall, reflecting moderate suspicion due to obfuscation but no confirmed malicious intent.\n\n#### Risk Score:\n- The risk scores are low (0.1 to 0.2), which is appropriate given the lack of malicious activity.\n- I agree with the provided scores, which are conservative and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Critical points:\n- The reports correctly identify the suspicious nature of the import name.\n- No claims are made about vulnerabilities, which is appropriate.\n- The code is benign in function, but obfuscation warrants further review of the imported module.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.6 (moderate suspicion due to nonsensical import name)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (low, given no malicious activity, but obfuscation warrants caution)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code appears benign, with obfuscation being the main concern. The scores are reasonable, but I would slightly lower the obfuscated score to 0.6 for consistency and the risk score to 0.2, reflecting cautious suspicion but no confirmed threat.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nFurther review of the local `.cmake` module and the purpose of the obfuscated symbol is advised to ensure no malicious intent or hidden backdoors.",
