  "purpose": "Define version information and export certain functions or variables for the module",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module (.cmake), and a string assignment",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or user input; no external data handling present",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are observable in this code fragment",
  "anomalies": "Unusual import name 'YRaswXdsfeeuZFoQLHgsCYqZPPKUSbHE' which appears as a nonsensical or obfuscated identifier; no other suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code imports a seemingly random or obfuscated attribute from a local module, then assigns a version string to a variable with a non-standard name. The code exports __version__ and setup in __all__, but '__version__' is not explicitly defined in this snippet, indicating possible reliance on external code. The import name and variable names suggest obfuscation or malicious intent, but given only this fragment, there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The structure is minimal and typical for a package's version file, but the import name is suspicious and may indicate obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to serve as a version and export configuration with suspicious import naming, potentially indicating obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious activity within this snippet, but the unusual import name warrants caution. Overall, the risk is low, but further review of the related modules is recommended.",
