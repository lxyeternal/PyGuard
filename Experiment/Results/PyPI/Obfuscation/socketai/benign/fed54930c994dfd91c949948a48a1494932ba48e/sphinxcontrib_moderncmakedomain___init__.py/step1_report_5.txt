{
  "purpose": "The code appears to import a specific class or function from a module and defines a version string and an export list, likely part of a package's __init__.py file.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .cmake, assignment of version string",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to data leaks",
  "flows": "Import source does not process untrusted data; version string is static and not influenced by external input",
  "anomalies": "The imported symbol 'YRaswXdsfeeuZFoQLHgsCYqZPPKUSbHE' has a non-descriptive, obfuscated name, which could be suspicious. The import source is relative, but no apparent malicious behavior; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a potentially obfuscated symbol from a local module, which could be for legitimate reasons such as encapsulation or obfuscation. The version string is hardcoded. No input handling, data processing, or suspicious code patterns are present. The presence of an obscure symbol name warrants a note, but does not constitute malicious behavior by itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal and primarily consists of imports and static variable definitions. There are no clear signs of malicious intent or security risks. The obfuscated import name is unusual but not inherently malicious. Overall, the code appears benign.",
