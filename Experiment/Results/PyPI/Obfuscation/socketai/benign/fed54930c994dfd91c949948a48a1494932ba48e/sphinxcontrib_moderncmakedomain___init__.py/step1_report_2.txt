{
  "purpose": "Define package metadata and import a specific symbol from a local module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .cmake and the string assignment for version information.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data could cause data leaks or execution effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the import and string assignment are static.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual symbol name 'YRaswXdsfeeuZFoQLHgsCYqZPPKUSbHE' that appears obfuscated or randomly generated; minimal code context; no comments or documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a symbol with a nonsensical name from a local module, which could be an attempt to hide or obfuscate. The version string is straightforward. The overall code is minimal, with no complex logic, dynamic execution, or suspicious network activity. The presence of an unusual symbol name raises suspicion about obfuscation or malicious intent, although it could also be benign. There are no apparent malicious functions or behaviors in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple package metadata setup with an obfuscated import symbol. There is no direct evidence of malicious behavior, but the unusual symbol name warrants further review of the module and its context. Overall, the snippet alone does not demonstrate malicious intent but raises a slight concern due to obfuscation.",
