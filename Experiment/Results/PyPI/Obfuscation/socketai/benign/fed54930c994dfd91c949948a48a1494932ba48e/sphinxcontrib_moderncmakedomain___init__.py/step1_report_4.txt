  "purpose": "Import a specific attribute from a local module and define version and export variables.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .cmake module, string assignment for version",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports and assigns variables",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable name YRaswXdsfeeuZFoQLHgsCYqZPPKUSbHE, which appears obfuscated or auto-generated; import from a relative module without context; no obvious reason for the obscurity",
  "analysis": "The code imports a symbol from a relative module named 'cmake', with an obfuscated name, which could be a sign of obfuscation or hiding malicious intent. The rest of the code assigns a version string to a variable with a clear name and defines __all__ for export. There are no network connections, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors visible. The obscure variable name may suggest attempts at hiding or obfuscating, but this alone does not indicate malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs basic import and variable assignment with an unusual variable name, but no malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The obfuscation might warrant further review of the imported module, but based solely on this code snippet, it appears benign.",
