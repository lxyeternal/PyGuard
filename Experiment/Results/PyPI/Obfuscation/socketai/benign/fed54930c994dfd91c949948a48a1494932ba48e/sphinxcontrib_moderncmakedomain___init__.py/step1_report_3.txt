  "purpose": "Import a specific class from a local module and define version information and export variables.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module, hardcoded string for version",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external outputs present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as no untrusted input is processed or output",
  "anomalies": "Unusual class name 'YRaswXdsfeeuZFoQLHgsCYqZPPKUSbHE' suggests obfuscation or autogenerated code; no clear purpose for the class, but no malicious activity evident",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class with an obscure, seemingly random name from a local module. It then sets a string variable with a version number and defines __all__ for module exports. There are no indicators of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or hidden backdoors. The obscure class name may suggest code obfuscation, but this alone does not imply malicious intent. The code is minimal and appears to serve as a module component, not an attack vector.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with no evident malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscated class name is unusual but not necessarily malicious. Overall, it is a simple module with no harmful intent.",
