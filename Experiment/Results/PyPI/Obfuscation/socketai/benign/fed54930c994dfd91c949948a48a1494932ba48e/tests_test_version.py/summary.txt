  "conclusion": "The code is likely benign but obfuscated, which could be used to hide malicious intent. The low malware score (0.2) is appropriate, and the high obfuscation score (0.8) reflects suspicion. Overall security risk remains low (~0.3). No evidence of malicious activity is present in this snippet, but further context or analysis of the imported object is recommended for comprehensive security assessment."
