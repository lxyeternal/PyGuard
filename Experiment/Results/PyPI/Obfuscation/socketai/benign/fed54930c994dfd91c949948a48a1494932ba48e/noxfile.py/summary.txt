  "conclusion": "The code is an obfuscated automation script performing legitimate tasks with no detected malicious activity. The primary security concern is reliance on external scripts without validation, which could be exploited if sources are compromised. Overall, it does not qualify as malware, but best practices recommend validating downloaded scripts to mitigate supply chain risks."
