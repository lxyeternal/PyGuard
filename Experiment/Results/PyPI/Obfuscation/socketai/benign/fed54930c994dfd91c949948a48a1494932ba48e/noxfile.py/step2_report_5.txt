  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, the validity of the reasoning, and the appropriateness of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes typical automation tasks; sources include session arguments, URLs from GitHub, and local files.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Downloads external scripts from trusted GitHub URLs, saves locally, updates version info.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Obfuscated function names, but no malicious indicators. External URLs are from legitimate repositories related to CMake.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity, benign automation, with some obfuscation.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0.0 — justified, no malware detected.  \n- Obfuscated: 0.8 — high, consistent with obfuscated function names.  \n- SecurityRisk: 0.2 — low, mainly due to obfuscation.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores seem reasonable. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar automation tasks; fetches remote scripts based on version info.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Downloads scripts from GitHub, updates __init__.py with regex.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Remote code fetches without validation; reliance on external sources could be risky.\n- **Conclusion:** Routine process, but potential supply chain risk due to external fetches; no direct malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — justified.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation noted.  \n- SecurityRisk: 0.3 — moderate, due to reliance on external sources.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar automation with external URL fetches, file modifications.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Dynamic URL construction, no validation, obfuscated names, potential for malicious code if URLs are compromised.\n- **Conclusion:** Moderate risk due to external fetches, obfuscation, and lack of validation.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — no malware observed.  \n- Obfuscated: 0.4 — some obfuscation, less than previous.  \n- SecurityRisk: 0.4 — moderate, justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar pattern—automation, external URL fetches, code modifications.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Obfuscated names, external code fetches without validation, potential supply chain risk.\n- **Conclusion:** Moderate risk, external fetches without verification.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0.2 — slightly elevated, considering the obfuscation and external fetches, but no malware detected.  \n- Obfuscated: 0.8 — high, consistent with report.  \n- SecurityRisk: 0.4 — justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Routine build and test automation; fetches scripts from GitHub.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Obfuscated variable names, but URLs are from legitimate sources, no validation issues.\n- **Conclusion:** Low risk, no malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — justified.  \n- Obfuscated: 0.3 — moderate obfuscation.  \n- SecurityRisk: 0.2 — low.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0 or very low, which aligns with the analysis—no malicious payloads or behavior are evident.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** Vary from 0.3 to 0.8, reflecting the obfuscation observed.\n- **Risk scores:** Range from 0.2 to 0.4, consistent with potential supply chain concerns due to external fetches but no direct malicious activity.\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** **0.0** — no evidence of malicious code or payloads.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0.6** — moderate obfuscation across multiple reports; slightly higher than some scores but justified.\n- **Risk:** **0.3** — moderate, mainly due to external dependencies and lack of validation, but no active malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe reports' scores are generally reasonable and consistent with the observed code behavior. The main concern is reliance on external sources without validation, which can be exploited in supply chain attacks, but no direct malware or malicious activity is present.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Malware score: **0.0**  \n- Obfuscated score: **0.6**  \n- Risk score: **0.3**",
