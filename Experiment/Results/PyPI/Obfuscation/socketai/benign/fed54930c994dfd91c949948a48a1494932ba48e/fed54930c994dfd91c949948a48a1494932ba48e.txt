      "conclusion": "The code is an obfuscated automation script performing legitimate tasks with no detected malicious activity. The primary security concern is reliance on external scripts without validation, which could be exploited if sources are compromised. Overall, it does not qualify as malware, but best practices recommend validating downloaded scripts to mitigate supply chain risks."

      "conclusion": "The code does not contain active malicious behavior but is heavily obfuscated, which warrants caution. The main security risk stems from unvalidated file paths and complex regex processing. No evidence of malware such as network activity, data theft, or system damage is present. The obfuscation appears to be for concealment or complexity rather than malicious intent. Overall, the code is a legitimate but obfuscated Sphinx extension with moderate security considerations."

The primary concern is obfuscation, not active malicious activity. Further review of the imported module is recommended to rule out hidden threats."

No evidence of malicious activity is present in this snippet, but further context or analysis of the imported object is recommended for comprehensive security assessment."

The malware score should remain at 0, and the security risk score should stay low (~0.1-0.2). The obfuscation score can be maintained as is, reflecting the naming style. The incomplete assertion should be corrected to prevent syntax errors."

The obfuscation is superficial and does not imply malicious intent. The assigned scores are consistent with the code's nature."
