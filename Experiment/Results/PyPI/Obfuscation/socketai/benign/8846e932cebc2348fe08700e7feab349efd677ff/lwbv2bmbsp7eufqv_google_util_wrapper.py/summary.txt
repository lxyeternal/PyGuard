  "conclusion": "The code exhibits obfuscation and dynamic behaviors that raise suspicion but lacks direct evidence of malicious payloads. The high obfuscation score is justified, and the moderate malware and risk scores are appropriate given the potential for misuse. Further dynamic analysis and contextual review are recommended before deployment or integration into supply chain environments."
