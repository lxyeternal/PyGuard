{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a standard Python module with imports and an __all__ declaration, likely part of a larger package. It does not contain any obvious malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.",
  "sources": "Relative import statements importing modules and functions; the variable 'NEDNSddmbifejJjnAvUqKyTUvquVsRox' assigned a version string.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; no network calls, file writes, or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "flows": "Imports and variable assignment occur at module load; no runtime data flows indicating malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable name 'NEDNSddmbifejJjnAvUqKyTUvquVsRox' and module names, but no malicious intent can be inferred solely from this.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python module with imports from internal modules and an __all__ list. The variable name is obfuscated but likely a version indicator. The reports are empty, providing no evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior. The lack of dynamic code, network activity, or suspicious patterns suggests benign intent. Obfuscation alone is not malicious. Scores should be minimal, reflecting no detected threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no evidence of malicious activity or vulnerabilities. The obfuscated variable name does not indicate malicious intent. The empty reports lack analysis, but based on the code snippet, the security risk is low.",
