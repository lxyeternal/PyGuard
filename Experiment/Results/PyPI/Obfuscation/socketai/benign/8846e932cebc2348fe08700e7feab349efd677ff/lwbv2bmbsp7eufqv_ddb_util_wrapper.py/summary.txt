  "conclusion": "The code is an obfuscated API client performing network requests without evident malicious payloads or system modifications. The primary concern is obfuscation, which could hide malicious intent, but no direct malicious actions are present. Malware score is low, obfuscation score is high, and security risk is moderate. Further validation and runtime analysis are recommended if used in sensitive environments."
