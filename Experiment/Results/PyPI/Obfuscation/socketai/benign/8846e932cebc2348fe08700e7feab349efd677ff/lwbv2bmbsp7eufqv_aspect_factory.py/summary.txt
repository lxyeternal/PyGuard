  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates high obfuscation and dynamic class creation patterns that could be exploited for malicious purposes, including code execution or data exfiltration, particularly when handling untrusted inputs. While no explicit malicious payloads are present, the structural risks warrant cautious review, input validation, and sandboxing before deployment."
