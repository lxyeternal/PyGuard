  "conclusion": "The code does not show clear malicious behavior but is heavily obfuscated and handles external data sources without validation, which could be exploited. The malware score is set to 0.1, reflecting suspicion mainly due to obfuscation, but no active malicious payloads are evident. The obfuscation score is high (~0.75), and the security risk is moderate (~0.4). Continuous validation and de-obfuscation are recommended for safe deployment."
