      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Python package setup script with an obfuscated package name. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected. The scores assigned are consistent with the static, safe nature of the code, with a minor note on the package name's obfuscation."

      "conclusion": "The code is an obfuscated API client performing network requests without evident malicious payloads or system modifications. The primary concern is obfuscation, which could hide malicious intent, but no direct malicious actions are present. Malware score is low, obfuscation score is high, and security risk is moderate. Further validation and runtime analysis are recommended if used in sensitive environments."

      "obfuscated": 0.75,
      "confidence": 0.85,
      "conclusion": "The code demonstrates high obfuscation and dynamic class creation patterns that could be exploited for malicious purposes, including code execution or data exfiltration, particularly when handling untrusted inputs. While no explicit malicious payloads are present, the structural risks warrant cautious review, input validation, and sandboxing before deployment."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits obfuscation and dynamic behaviors that raise suspicion but lacks direct evidence of malicious payloads. The high obfuscation score is justified, and the moderate malware and risk scores are appropriate given the potential for misuse. Further dynamic analysis and contextual review are recommended before deployment or integration into supply chain environments."

      "conclusion": "The code does not show clear malicious behavior but is heavily obfuscated and handles external data sources without validation, which could be exploited. The malware score is set to 0.1, reflecting suspicion mainly due to obfuscation, but no active malicious payloads are evident. The obfuscation score is high (~0.75), and the security risk is moderate (~0.4). Continuous validation and de-obfuscation are recommended for safe deployment."
