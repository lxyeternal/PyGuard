  "purpose": "Set up configuration for a Python package distribution, defining dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Code imports 'setuptools' for packaging; dependencies are listed in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that handle untrusted data; no network or system modifications present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow; the code is purely declarative for package setup.",
  "anomalies": "The package name appears as a random string ('lwbv2bmbsp7eufqv'), which could be a random or obfuscated identifier but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup' with standard parameters for package configuration. The 'install_requires' includes common packages like 'boto3', 'requests', 'openai', 'anthropic', 'paper-qa', 'langchain', and 'importlib'. These are popular libraries, and their presence alone is not suspicious. The package name is unusual but not malicious in itself. There are no code execution, network activities, or hidden behaviors. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are visible.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script for a Python package with typical dependencies. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this code.",
