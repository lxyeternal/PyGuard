  "purpose": "Define and configure a Python package with specified dependencies using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The setup() function parameters, including 'name', 'version', and 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static configuration without runtime data handling.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration; no data flow or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "The package name 'lwbv2bmbsp7eufqv' appears as a random string, suggesting obfuscation or unique identification but no malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package, with no dynamic code, network activity, or malicious constructs. The only notable feature is the unusual, seemingly obfuscated package name, which could be for evasion or uniqueness. Dependencies are common and benign. No hardcoded secrets, code injection, or suspicious behaviors are present. The malware score is appropriately zero, and security risk is minimal. The obfuscated package name slightly elevates suspicion but does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code is benign and safe for use.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Python package setup script with an obfuscated package name. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected. The scores assigned are consistent with the static, safe nature of the code, with a minor note on the package name's obfuscation.",
