  "purpose": "This code is a simple UTF-8 encoding declaration comment with no executable logic or external interactions.",
  "sources": "None; the code contains only a comment line.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows exist in this code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is just a comment.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal comment indicating UTF-8 encoding. No executable code, data processing, or external interactions are present. The code does not read input, write output, or handle untrusted data. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors, no obfuscation, and no anomalies. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, containing only a comment line. There is no malicious intent, no security risk, and no obfuscation. The existing reports correctly assess the code as benign, and no modifications are necessary.",
