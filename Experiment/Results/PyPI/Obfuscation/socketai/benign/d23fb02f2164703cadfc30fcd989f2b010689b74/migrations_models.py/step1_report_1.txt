{
  "purpose": "The code appears to specify the encoding for the Python source file as UTF-8.",
  "sources": "No data sources or input reading occurs in this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows are observable in this minimal code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a file encoding declaration; no anomalies or suspicious behavior are evident.",
  "analysis": "This is a very minimal, standard file encoding declaration that does not perform any operations, read data, or execute logic. It is unlikely to be malicious, serving solely as a directive for the Python interpreter. Since no other code is present, there are no potential sources, sinks, or flows. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless encoding declaration with no malicious behavior or security risks. It is standard boilerplate and contains no suspicious elements.",
