  "purpose": "This code snippet specifies the UTF-8 encoding for a Python source file.",
  "sources": "The encoding declaration comment at the beginning of the file.",
  "sinks": "There are no data inputs or outputs; no untrusted data sources or sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths exist, as the code contains only a comment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code behavior are present; the snippet is a standard encoding declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, benign encoding declaration with no executable logic, data handling, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The code does not perform any malicious activity or contain obfuscation. The scores are consistent with the content, and no further analysis or action is necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and appropriate given the minimal nature of the snippet.",
