  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths are identifiable in this minimal code.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of a file encoding declaration without any functional code, which is unusual but not malicious. There are no signs of obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "This snippet only contains a coding declaration specifying UTF-8 encoding. It lacks any functional logic, data handling, or external interactions. Since it is just a single line, there are no security concerns or suspicious activities observable.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is benign, serving solely as a file encoding declaration. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risk within this minimal content.",
