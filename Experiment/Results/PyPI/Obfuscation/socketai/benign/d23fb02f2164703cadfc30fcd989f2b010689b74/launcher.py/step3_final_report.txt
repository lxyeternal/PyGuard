  "purpose": "Manage access tokens by reading, writing, validating, and prompting user decisions regarding token usage and deletion.",
  "sources": "File system reads/writes for token files, environment variables for API prefixes, user input prompts for token reuse or deletion.",
  "sinks": "File operations for storing/deleting tokens, user prompts for decision making, validation functions for token correctness.",
  "flows": "Source: File reads or environment variables -> Validation functions -> User prompts -> File writes/deletes based on user input.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation via non-descriptive variable and function names; no network activity or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code manages tokens through file IO, environment variables, and user prompts. Obfuscation is present but appears to serve concealment rather than malicious intent. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious routines are observed. Validation functions are used appropriately. The heavy variable name obfuscation raises suspicion but does not demonstrate malicious behavior. The logic is consistent with legitimate token management. The scores assigned in the original reports (malware: 0, risk: 0.2, obfuscated: ~0.6) are justified based on the evidence.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate token management utility with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious intent or activity. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not elevate the security risk significantly. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the observed behavior.",
