{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set the encoding to UTF-8 and may serve as a header or metadata in a Python script.",
  "sources": "The only source present is the encoding declaration at the beginning of the file.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows are observable since the code contains only a comment and encoding declaration.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a comment with no executable logic; the encoding declaration is standard and harmless.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a shebang comment specifying UTF-8 encoding. There are no functions, variables, data input/output, or other executable statements. As such, there are no potential security risks or malicious behaviors present. The lack of any logic or data handling means no source-to-sink flows or anomalies are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is benign, serving only as an encoding declaration header. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security concerns.",
