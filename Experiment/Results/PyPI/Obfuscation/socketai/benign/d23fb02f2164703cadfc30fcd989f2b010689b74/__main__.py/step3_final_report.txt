  "purpose": "This code contains only a UTF-8 encoding declaration comment, serving as a file header to specify encoding. It does not perform any executable actions or data processing.",
  "sources": "No data sources or input points; the code is only a comment line.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flows; there are no source-to-sink paths in this code.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, variables, functions, or suspicious constructs; only a comment line present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single comment specifying UTF-8 encoding, which is a standard practice in Python files. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The code is benign and serves a purely declarative purpose. The high confidence scores (1) are justified due to the simplicity and transparency of the code. No anomalies or suspicious features are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, containing only a standard encoding declaration. There are no malicious activities, obfuscation, or security concerns. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all correctly set to 0, reflecting the benign nature of this snippet.",
