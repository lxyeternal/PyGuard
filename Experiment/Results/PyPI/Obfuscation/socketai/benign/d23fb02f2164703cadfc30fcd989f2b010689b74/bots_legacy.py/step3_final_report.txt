  "purpose": "This code snippet is a simple UTF-8 encoding declaration comment, serving as metadata for the Python file.",
  "sources": "The code reads no input or external data; it contains only a comment line.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flows exist, as the code contains only a comment with no executable or data-processing elements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors are present; the snippet is a standard encoding declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single comment specifying UTF-8 encoding, with no executable logic, data input/output, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The scores assigned (malware: 0.0, obfuscated: 0.0, securityRisk: 0.0) are appropriate and consistent with the code content. Given the simplicity and benign nature, there are no signs of malicious intent or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless encoding declaration with no malicious or security-related issues. All assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
