  "analysis": "The provided code is only a single line specifying the file's character encoding. It does not include any logic, data processing, or external interactions. As such, it cannot perform malicious actions or contain security risks. This minimal declaration is common and benign.",
  "conclusion": "There is no malicious behavior or security risk in this code snippet. It is simply an encoding declaration with no operational content.",
