  "sources": "No input sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing functions present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths since the code contains only a comment.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of any executable code or suspicious patterns; the file contains only an encoding declaration comment.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet is purely a comment specifying the source code encoding as UTF-8. There are no functions, variables, or logic that could be malicious or contain security risks. Since there are no data inputs, outputs, or operations, there are no security concerns or malicious behaviors present in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and contains only a non-executable comment about encoding. There is no malicious intent or security risk detectable in this minimal snippet.",
