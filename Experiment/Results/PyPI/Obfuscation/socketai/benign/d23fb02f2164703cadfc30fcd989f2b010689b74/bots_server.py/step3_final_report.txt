  "purpose": "This code contains only a UTF-8 encoding declaration comment with no executable logic or external interactions, serving as a minimal placeholder or metadata indicator.",
  "sources": "The code reads no input, data, or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects, as no data processing occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks, since the code contains only a comment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is a simple comment.",
  "analysis": "The code is a plain comment with only a UTF-8 encoding declaration, containing no executable statements, data processing, or external interactions. All reviews correctly identify its benign and minimal nature. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the content. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The code is essentially a placeholder with no security implications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, contains only a comment, and poses no security or malicious threat. The current assessment and scores are accurate and justified. No adjustments are necessary.",
