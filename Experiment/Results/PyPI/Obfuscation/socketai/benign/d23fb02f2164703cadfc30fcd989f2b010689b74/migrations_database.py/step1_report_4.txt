  "purpose": "The code only specifies the encoding for the Python source file.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a coding declaration; no operational logic, inputs, or outputs are present. No suspicious or unusual code features.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal file with only a shebang for UTF-8 encoding declaration. It does not perform any operations, read data, write output, or include any external libraries or code segments. As a result, there are no security concerns, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation present. The absence of logic indicates no potential for malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a simple encoding declaration with no operational code. There are no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation.",
