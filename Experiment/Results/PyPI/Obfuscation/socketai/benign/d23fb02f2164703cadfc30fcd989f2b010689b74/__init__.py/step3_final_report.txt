{
  "purpose": "Minimal placeholder code specifying file encoding with no executable logic or data handling.",
  "sources": "None; the code contains only a comment declaring encoding.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow, input, or output operations are present.",
  "flows": "None; no source-to-sink data paths exist.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, functions, or data interactions; only a comment line.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single encoding declaration comment with no logic, data handling, or external interactions. All reviews confirm its benign nature, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the content. Confidence is high (1.0) due to the straightforward, minimal nature of the code. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, serving solely as a file encoding declaration. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The current assessment and scores are accurate and should remain unchanged.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
