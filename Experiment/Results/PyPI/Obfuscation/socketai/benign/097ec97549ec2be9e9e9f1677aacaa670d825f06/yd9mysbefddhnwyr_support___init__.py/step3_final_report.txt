  "purpose": "Assess the supply chain security of the open source Python dependency by analyzing code snippets for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Input data from code snippets, environment variables, external dependencies, and network interactions.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network transmissions, file modifications, or execution of malicious code.",
  "flows": "Sources such as user input or environment variables flow into processing functions; untrusted data could reach sinks like network sockets or file system operations.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious network activity; code appears benign across all snippets.",
  "analysis": "All provided code snippets lack indicators of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. Malware scores are justified as zero due to no malicious activity. Obfuscation scores are zero, matching the absence of obfuscation techniques. Security risk scores are conservatively set at 0.2, reflecting minor concerns but no evidence of threats. Confidence levels are high where code is available, slightly lower with limited context. No anomalies or suspicious flows are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets are benign, with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The current scoring (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2) is appropriate and consistent with the analysis. Slightly lowering the security risk score to 0.1 could be considered for a more conservative stance, but 0.2 remains acceptable.",
