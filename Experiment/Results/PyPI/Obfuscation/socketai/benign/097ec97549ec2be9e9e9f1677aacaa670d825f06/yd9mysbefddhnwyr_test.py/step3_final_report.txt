  "purpose": "A command-line utility for parsing ASN.1 files, building semantic models, and generating pyasn1 code.",
  "sources": "Reads ASN.1 files specified via command-line arguments; processes input data through 'asn1ate' library functions.",
  "sinks": "Outputs generated Python code to stdout or files; no untrusted data sinks or network communication observed.",
  "flows": "Input ASN.1 file -> parsing functions -> semantic modeling -> code generation -> output files or stdout.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of variable and function names; use of dynamic code generation; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard ASN.1 processing CLI tool utilizing 'asn1ate'. Obfuscated identifiers suggest code generation or stylistic obfuscation rather than malicious intent. No network activity, data exfiltration, or suspicious system calls are present. The obfuscation level varies but is consistent with code generation artifacts. No malicious payloads or backdoors are evident. The code's operations are benign, focusing on parsing, modeling, and code output. The lack of external communication and sensitive data handling further reduces risk. The obfuscation does not appear to serve malicious concealment but warrants cautious review in sensitive contexts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign ASN.1 processing utility with obfuscated variable names likely due to code generation or stylistic choices. No malicious activity, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. The supply chain security risk is minimal, with malware score 0, low risk score (~0.2), and moderate obfuscation. Overall, it presents no significant security concern.",
