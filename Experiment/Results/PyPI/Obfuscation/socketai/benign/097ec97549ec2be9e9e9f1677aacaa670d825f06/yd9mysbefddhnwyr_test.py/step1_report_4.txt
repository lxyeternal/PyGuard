  "purpose": "The script is a command-line tool for processing ASN.1 files using the 'asn1ate' library, enabling parsing, semantic modeling, and code generation.",
  "sources": "Reads input filename from command-line argument; reads ASN.1 file content from the specified file.",
  "sinks": "Outputs generated Python code to stdout or a specified directory; prints messages to stdout; raises exceptions if output file exists.",
  "flows": "Input filename -> Read ASN.1 content -> Parse ASN.1 -> Build semantic model -> Generate Python code -> Write output to file or stdout.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears largely standard for a command-line interface. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. No suspicious network activity or hidden behaviors are evident. Uses standard libraries and functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a CLI for ASN.1 processing, with options for parsing, semantic modeling, and code generation. It reads ASN.1 files, processes them via the 'asn1ate' library, and outputs Python modules either to stdout or files. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. No external network activity or data exfiltration observed. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns. The code is structured clearly with straightforward flow and no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard ASN.1 processing tool with no evident malicious behavior or security risks. It performs file reading, parsing, semantic modeling, and code generation in a typical manner. No indicators of malware, backdoors, or security issues are detected.",
