  "purpose": "A command-line tool for parsing ASN.1 files, building semantic models, and generating pyasn1 code.",
  "sources": "Reads ASN.1 file specified by command-line argument; reads file content for processing.",
  "sinks": "Outputs generated code to stdout or file; does not send data externally or perform network actions.",
  "flows": "Input file is read -> parsed into model -> optionally semantic analysis -> code generation -> output to stdout or file.",
  "anomalies": "Uses heavily obfuscated variable names; no hardcoded secrets or credentials; no suspicious network or system calls; normal command-line processing.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical CLI tool for ASN.1 processing, with standard input/output handling, argument parsing, and code generation. No code indicates data exfiltration, remote control, or malicious backdoors. Variable names are intentionally obfuscated, which can be a sign of trying to hide intent, but in this context appears to be a coding style choice rather than malicious obfuscation. No dynamic code execution or suspicious library usage was observed. The process is straightforward: parse ASN.1, generate code, output. No external communications or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign ASN.1 processing utility with no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. Obfuscated variable names are likely stylistic rather than malicious. No malicious signals are present.",
