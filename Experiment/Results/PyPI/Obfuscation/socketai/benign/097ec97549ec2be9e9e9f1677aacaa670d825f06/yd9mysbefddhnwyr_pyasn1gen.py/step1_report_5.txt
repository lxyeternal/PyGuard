{
  "purpose": "The code generates Python classes from ASN.1 definition files, outputting to stdout or separate files, primarily for ASN.1 parsing and encoding.",
  "sources": "File input via open() on ASN.1 file, command-line arguments, and internal module references.",
  "sinks": "Generated Python code written to files or stdout, function calls that process ASN.1 components, and potential network or environment interactions (none evident).",
  "flows": "Input ASN.1 file read -> Parsing -> Code generation functions called -> Output written to files or stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code performs ASN.1 to Python class conversion, which is standard. No network connections, file system modifications beyond file reads/writes, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script reads an ASN.1 file, parses it using a third-party parser, and generates Python classes representing ASN.1 structures. The code includes functions for handling ASN.1 types, constraints, and tags, and outputs Python class definitions accordingly. The module references are for ASN.1 constructs, and all file operations appear standard. No signs of malicious data exfiltration, system disruption, or suspicious network activity. The code's complexity stems from ASN.1 handling logic, not obfuscation or malicious intent. The code is well-structured for a code generator, with no evidence of backdoors or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical ASN.1 to Python class generator with no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. It reads input files, processes ASN.1 definitions, and outputs Python code. No suspicious activity, malware, or security risks identified based on the provided source. Confidence is high that this is a legitimate code generation tool.",
