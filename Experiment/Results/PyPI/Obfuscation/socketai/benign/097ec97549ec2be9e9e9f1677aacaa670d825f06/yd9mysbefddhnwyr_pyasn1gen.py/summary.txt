  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate ASN.1 to Python class generator with no active malicious behavior. The primary security consideration is sanitizing ASN.1 inputs before code generation to mitigate injection risks. Scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior."
