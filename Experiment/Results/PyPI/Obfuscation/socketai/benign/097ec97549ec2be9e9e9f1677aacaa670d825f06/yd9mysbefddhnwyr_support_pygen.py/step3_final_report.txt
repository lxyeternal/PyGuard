  "purpose": "Utility functions and classes for generating file headers, managing indentation, and formatting output streams, primarily for code generation or pretty-printing tasks.",
  "sources": "File modification time and filename via os.path functions, input strings for output formatting.",
  "sinks": "Formatted header strings written to output streams, no untrusted data flows or external data handling detected.",
  "flows": "File metadata (modification time, filename) used to generate header comments; indentation controls affect output formatting; no external or untrusted data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names, but no malicious or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, network activity, or malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility classes for managing indentation and output formatting, and a function for generating header comments based on file metadata. It uses standard libraries and performs benign operations. Obfuscation appears superficial, mainly in naming conventions, without any malicious intent or malicious code segments. No network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications are present. The code's purpose is benign, and the obfuscation does not elevate security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency is a benign utility module for formatting and header generation, with superficial obfuscation. No malicious behavior, malware, or security threats are evident. The high obfuscation score reflects naming obfuscation but does not imply malicious intent. Overall, the code poses minimal security risk.",
