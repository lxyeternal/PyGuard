      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code does not contain malicious behavior or malware, but the use of 'exec()' to execute local package code for version retrieval poses a moderate security risk. No active malicious activity is detected, but the pattern is potentially exploitable if the source files are compromised."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate ASN.1 to Python class generator with no active malicious behavior. The primary security consideration is sanitizing ASN.1 inputs before code generation to mitigate injection risks. Scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior."

      "obfuscated": 0.8,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code functions as a complex ASN.1 schema parser with significant obfuscation. There is no direct evidence of malicious activity such as network communication, data theft, or system modification. The obfuscation, however, raises concerns about potential concealment of malicious payloads or backdoors. Based on the analysis, it is prudent to consider this code as potentially risky due to its obfuscation, but not actively malicious at present."

      "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign, serving as a static version assignment with obfuscated variable naming. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security risk based solely on this fragment. The suspicion due to obfuscation is acknowledged but not justified as malicious. Overall, the code is safe, and the current scores are appropriate."

      "obfuscated": 0.8,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is a complex ASN.1 parser generator with heavy obfuscation but no malicious behavior or external system interactions. The malware score of 0 is justified, and the low security risk score reflects the benign nature of the code. Vigilance should be maintained if incorporated into supply chain processes, but current analysis indicates it is safe."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a benign ASN.1 processing utility with obfuscated variable names likely due to code generation or stylistic choices. No malicious activity, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. The supply chain security risk is minimal, with malware score 0, low risk score (~0.2), and moderate obfuscation. Overall, it presents no significant security concern."

The current scoring (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2) is appropriate and consistent with the analysis. Slightly lowering the security risk score to 0.1 could be considered for a more conservative stance, but 0.2 remains acceptable."

      "conclusion": "The dependency is a benign utility module for formatting and header generation, with superficial obfuscation. No malicious behavior, malware, or security threats are evident. The high obfuscation score reflects naming obfuscation but does not imply malicious intent. Overall, the code poses minimal security risk."
