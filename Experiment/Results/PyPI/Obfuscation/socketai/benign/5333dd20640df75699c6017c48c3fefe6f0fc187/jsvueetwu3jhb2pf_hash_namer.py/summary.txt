  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a pattern matching utility with obfuscated identifiers and incomplete references. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or malicious data exfiltration. The main issues are obfuscation and potential bugs, not security risks. The malware score remains at 0, the obfuscation score is high (~0.75), and the overall security risk is low (~0.2)."
