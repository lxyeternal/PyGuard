  "purpose": "A command-line utility for hash identification and analysis, supporting multiple input modes and output formats.",
  "sources": "CLI options for text input, file input, environment variables for logging, and internal modules providing hash checking and formatting.",
  "sinks": "Logging outputs, print statements, and potential external module calls; no network or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Input data from CLI options flows through hash checking functions, then to output formatting and display functions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variable and function names, inconsistent flag variable naming, and complex verbose options. No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a hash analysis CLI tool with multiple modes, utilizing external modules for hash checking and formatting. Obfuscated naming appears superficial, likely stylistic or auto-generated, not indicative of malicious intent. No network activity, data leaks, or system modifications are present. The obfuscation level is moderate, but the code's behavior remains benign. The logic flow is straightforward, with input validation, processing, and output. The logging configuration adapts based on verbosity flags, and the code structure is typical for CLI tools, despite obfuscated identifiers.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate hash analysis utility with superficial obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation appears stylistic rather than malicious, and the overall security posture is safe.",
