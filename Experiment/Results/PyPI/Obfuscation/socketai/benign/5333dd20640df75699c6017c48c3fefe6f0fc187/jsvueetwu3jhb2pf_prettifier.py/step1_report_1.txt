{
  "purpose": "The code appears to handle hash information, process objects with hash data, and generate formatted output for analysis or display.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from the 'objs' list passed to various methods, and from environment variables and external modules like 'hash_info'.",
  "sinks": "Outputs formatted strings via the rich Console object; no direct data leaks or network communications are observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input objects into internal dictionaries, then into formatted output functions; no untrusted data is transmitted externally.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variable names (e.g., yjGBdTHtiHNdCZkytobjBtHWsbIoXJdw, oFMYHVoSAKjeiJRsgBplVBKrmHUhloew), inconsistent string concatenations, and seemingly redundant code (e.g., repeated checks and unclear variable usage). The code includes functions that seem to format and display hash info, but some parts have undefined variables (e.g., 'hc', 'john', 'des') which indicates incomplete or malformed code.",
  "analysis": "The code is heavily obfuscated with non-descriptive variable names, which complicates understanding. It processes a list of objects with hash data, combines their hash objects, and optionally filters based on popularity. It then formats and prints hash info, with different sections for most and least likely hashes. There is no evidence of network activity, system modification, or data exfiltration. The presence of undefined variables suggests possible incomplete implementation or intentional obfuscation. No suspicious network connections, credential leaks, or malicious payloads are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily performs data processing and formatted output related to hash analysis, with signs of obfuscation and potential incompleteness. There is no indication of malicious behavior or security risks within this code snippet.",
