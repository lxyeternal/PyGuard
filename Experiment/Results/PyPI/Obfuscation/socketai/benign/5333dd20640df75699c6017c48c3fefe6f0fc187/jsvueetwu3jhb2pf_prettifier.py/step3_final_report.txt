{
  "purpose": "The code processes hash information, formats output, and displays hash-related data, primarily for analysis or reporting purposes.",
  "sources": "Input data is provided via method parameters, such as 'objs' (list of objects with hash data), and external modules like 'hash_info' provide additional hash info.",
  "sinks": "Output is directed to a rich console for display; no network, file, or system modification activities are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input objects through processing functions (e.g., updating dictionaries, filtering by popularity) to formatted console output.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains heavily obfuscated variable names, inconsistent references (e.g., 'hc', 'john', 'des'), and undefined variables, indicating obfuscation or incomplete snippets.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a utility for processing and displaying hash data, with functions for formatting and filtering. The obfuscated variable names and inconsistent references suggest intentional obfuscation or incomplete code, but no malicious payloads, network activity, or system modifications are evident. The undefined variables and inconsistent references are suspicious but do not demonstrate malicious intent within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign hash data processing utility with significant obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communication, or system compromise. The high obfuscation score reflects the variable naming and inconsistent references, but the malware score remains at zero. Overall, the security risk is low.",
