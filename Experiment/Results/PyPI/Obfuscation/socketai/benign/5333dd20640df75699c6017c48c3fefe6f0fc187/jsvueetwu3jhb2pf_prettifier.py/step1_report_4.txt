{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a utility for analyzing hash objects, likely related to password or data hashing, with functions for formatting and outputting hash-related information, possibly for security analysis or report generation.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from the 'objs' parameter in various methods, which are expected to be lists of objects with hash data, and environment variables or external inputs are not directly used.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs formatted logs and JSON data via the 'rich.console.Console' object, primarily for display purposes. No data is sent over the network or written to files in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input objects ('objs') through processing functions that extract hash info and format output. The flow includes collecting hash data, filtering popular hashes, and printing formatted results.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names and functions, inconsistent code style, potential variable name mismatches (e.g., 'hc', 'john', 'des' are used but not defined within scope), and possible incomplete or malformed string formatting. The code references external 'hash_info' but does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles hash data objects, formats output, and displays results using 'rich'. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as network communication, system modification, or data theft. The obfuscation of variable names and inconsistent code constructs suggest the code may be intentionally difficult to interpret but do not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or harmful operations are present. The only potential concern is the obfuscated style, but it appears to be for obscurity rather than malicious action.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a hash data formatter and reporter, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. Its obfuscated style does not correlate with malicious activity, and no harmful operations are evident.",
