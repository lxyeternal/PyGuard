  "purpose": "Check Python environment compatibility and run a specific function from an external module.",
  "sources": "Reads Python version info from sys.version_info",
  "sinks": "Calls runner.KScVbofCjbNRWvaqjwMxakGlMRqwMNhr() from an imported module",
  "flows": "sys.version_info -> environment version check -> import from name_that_hash -> execute runner function",
  "anomalies": "Use of heavily obfuscated variable names, dynamic import, and function call without clear purpose; no visible malicious code or data leaks",
  "analysis": "The script primarily verifies that the running Python version is at least 3.7, then imports a module named 'name_that_hash' and executes its 'runner' function. The variable names are intentionally obfuscated, but the code does not exhibit signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or system modifications. The imported module's content is unknown, which introduces some uncertainty, but based on this code alone, there are no indications of malware or malicious intent. The script's obfuscation seems to serve as an attempt to hide the true purpose or to deter analysis, but it does not involve malicious code within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs environment validation and invokes a function from an external module with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or malware in this snippet; however, reliance on an unknown external module warrants caution. Overall, it appears to be a legitimate version check and dispatch pattern with obfuscation, but not inherently malicious.",
