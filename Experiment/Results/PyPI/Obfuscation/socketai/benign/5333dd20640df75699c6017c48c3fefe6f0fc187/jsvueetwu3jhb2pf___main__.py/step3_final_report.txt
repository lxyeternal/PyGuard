  "purpose": "Performs a Python version check and delegates execution to an external module 'name_that_hash'.",
  "sources": "Reads Python version info from sys.version_info; imports 'name_that_hash' module.",
  "sinks": "Calls 'runner.KScVbofCjbNRWvaqjwMxakGlMRqwMNhr()' in external module; no direct sinks in this code.",
  "flows": "Version info read -> version check -> import external module -> call external function.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; reliance on external, unknown code; no direct malicious code in snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a version check for Python >=3.7, then imports and executes a function from an external module with obfuscated identifiers. The obfuscation and external dependency are suspicious but not inherently malicious. No malicious payloads or data leaks are visible within this snippet. The main concern is trustworthiness of 'name_that_hash'. The code itself is benign, but the external module could contain malicious behavior. The obfuscation justifies a high obfuscation score (~0.75). The malware risk is low (~0.2) due to lack of evidence of malicious activity, but the external dependency warrants caution. The overall security risk is moderate (~0.3).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign version check and delegation pattern but relies on an external, obfuscated module whose safety cannot be confirmed. The high obfuscation and external dependency justify a cautious stance, though no direct malicious activity is evident.",
