  "conclusion": "The code is a static collection of regex patterns and data structures for hash and credential format identification. It contains no malicious payloads, obfuscation, or dynamic behavior. The provided reports correctly assess the benign nature of the code, with scores of zero for malware and obfuscation, and a very low security risk score. The scores are consistent with the code's purpose and structure. No further action or modification is necessary."
