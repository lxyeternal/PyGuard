  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package, defining metadata, dependencies, and entry points, with obfuscated variable names.",
  "sources": "Variables holding package data, dependencies, and entry points",
  "sinks": "The setup() function call, which processes the provided configuration data",
  "flows": "Data flows from obfuscated variables into the setup() function as arguments",
  "anomalies": "Superficial obfuscation of variable names; no malicious code, network activity, or secrets detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names that do not impact functionality. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or malicious behaviors are present. The obfuscation appears superficial, likely to hinder readability but not to conceal malicious intent. The dependencies and entry points are typical and benign. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious URLs are found. The malware score is justified as 0, given the absence of malicious code. The obfuscation score is high due to variable name obfuscation but is considered superficial. The security risk score remains low, reflecting the benign static configuration. The confidence score is high, as the analysis is straightforward and consistent across multiple assessments.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is a benign package configuration with superficial obfuscation. There is no evidence of malware or malicious activity. The current scores—malware=0, obfuscated=0.75, securityRisk=0.1—are appropriate and consistent with the code's static, configuration-only nature.",
