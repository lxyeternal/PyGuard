  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'jsvueetwu3jhb2pf', configuring package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Variables defining package metadata, dependencies, and entry points; data read during the setup process.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function call which initiates package installation; potential for malicious actions if manipulated or exploited.",
  "flows": "Metadata variables -> setup() function -> package installation.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names (e.g., 'edsuGfMqbYRDsSqSGUOIiiIIkaRsuKKb'), which serve no clear purpose and obscure intent. No direct hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code uses obfuscated variable names to hold package data such as dependencies and entry points. These variables are then passed to the setup() function, which is standard in Python packaging. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious imports are detected. The obfuscation appears solely to hide variable names, not malicious intent. All package metadata appears benign, and dependencies are standard. The lack of network code or data exfiltration methods suggests low risk. Overall, the script functions as a typical setup configuration with obfuscated variable names but no evident malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script with obfuscated variable names, likely to hinder quick readability, but contains no malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation is superficial and does not indicate malicious intent.",
