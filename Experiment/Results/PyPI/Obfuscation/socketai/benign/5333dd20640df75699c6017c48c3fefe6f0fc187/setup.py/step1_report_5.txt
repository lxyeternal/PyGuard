{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up a Python package distribution with specific dependencies and entry points.",
  "sources": "The package data, dependencies, author info, and entry points are defined via variables, and the setup function consumes these variables.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function processes the provided configuration to install dependencies and create command-line scripts.",
  "flows": "Data flows from variable definitions into the setup() call, configuring package installation and script creation.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names appear obfuscated or randomly generated, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious URLs are present. The code appears to be standard package setup code, with no suspicious imports, code injection, or external data leaks.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() with configuration data. Variable names are obfuscated but only serve as data containers. The dependencies and entry points are standard. No network calls, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behavior is present. The obfuscated variable names could suggest an attempt to conceal intent, but without malicious code or external malicious behavior, this alone is not suspicious. The package appears to be a typical setup script for a Python package, with no malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard package setup script with obfuscated variable names. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected. The obfuscation appears to be an attempt to conceal variable intent rather than malicious activity.",
