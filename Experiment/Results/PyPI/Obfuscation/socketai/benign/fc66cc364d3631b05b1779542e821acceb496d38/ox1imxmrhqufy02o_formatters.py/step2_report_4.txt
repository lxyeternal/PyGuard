  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code snippets, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose:** The code is for formatting and generating HTML/CSS/JavaScript for diff visualization.\n- **Sources/Sinks:** No external data input; outputs are static or sanitized.\n- **Flow:** String manipulations, class inheritance, static methods for diff annotations.\n- **Anomalies:** Presence of embedded minified JavaScript, but it appears benign, related to toggling diff views.\n- **Security Aspects:** Uses `escape_html` in relevant functions, reducing injection risk.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity detected; code appears safe.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0 (benign) — matches the analysis.  \n- Obfuscated: 0.1 (minimal obfuscation) — consistent.  \n- Risk: 0.2 (low risk) — reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, focusing on HTML/CSS/JavaScript rendering with diff styling.\n- No external input sources or network activity.\n- JavaScript is static, for toggling UI elements.\n- Uses `escape_html` for sanitization.\n- No suspicious patterns or obfuscation.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Obfuscated: 0.2 (some obfuscation in string handling) — acceptable.  \n- Risk: 0.2 — consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- Focuses on generating styled HTML and JavaScript for diff display.\n- No external data reading; static content.\n- JavaScript handles UI toggling, appears benign.\n- No signs of malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — justified.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — consistent.  \n- Risk: 0.2 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- Similar purpose: diff visualization with styling and toggling.\n- Static string templates; no external input.\n- JavaScript for toggling diff sections.\n- No malicious patterns.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — justified.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — consistent.  \n- Risk: 0 — reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- Generates HTML, CSS, terminal escape sequences for diff display.\n- No external input; static content.\n- JavaScript for toggling diff views.\n- No signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — consistent.  \n- Risk: 0.1 — reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports describe code that primarily generates styled HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for diff visualization, with some terminal formatting. No external input reading, network activity, or data exfiltration is evident.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscation:** Slight obfuscation in string handling is noted but not malicious.\n- **Risk Scores:** Low, reflecting the lack of external data or risky operations.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n**Malware Score:**  \n- **Estimated:** 0 — consistent with the analysis, no malicious activity detected.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:**  \n- **Estimated:** 0.1 to 0.2 — minor obfuscation, but nothing suspicious.\n\n**Risk Score:**  \n- **Estimated:** 0.1 — very low, given the static nature and sanitization.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code appears to be a benign diff visualization utility, with no signs of malware, malicious obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0.1–0.2, risk = 0.1–0.2.
