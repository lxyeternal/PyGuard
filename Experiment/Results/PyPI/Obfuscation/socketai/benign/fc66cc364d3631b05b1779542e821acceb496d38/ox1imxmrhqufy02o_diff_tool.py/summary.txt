  "conclusion": "The code functions as a legitimate nested diff utility with configurable output formats. No evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or supply chain compromise is found. The use of environment variables for headers poses minimal risk if environment control is maintained. Obfuscation is superficial and likely auto-generated. The overall security risk is low."
