  "conclusion": "The code is a sophisticated yet benign data format conversion and diffing CLI utility. No evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or supply chain compromise. Obfuscation is present but not malicious. The security risk is low, and the malware score is zero. The obfuscation score is moderate due to cryptic naming. Overall, the supply chain security posture is acceptable."
