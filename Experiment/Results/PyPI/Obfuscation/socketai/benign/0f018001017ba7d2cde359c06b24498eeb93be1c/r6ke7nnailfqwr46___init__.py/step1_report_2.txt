  "purpose": "Import all functions and classes from the local crypto module and define a version string.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local crypto module, and the assignment of the version string.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No significant data flow from sources to sinks; the import and variable assignment are isolated.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no obfuscation, no hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors. The variable name appears random but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports everything from a local 'crypto' module, which is common in Python projects. The variable name 'ZvBkONxcbqMWqwxWmaPoOMGOmaTYqmut' looks like a randomly generated string, possibly obfuscated or auto-generated, but there is no direct evidence of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The version string '0.1.2' is typical for package versioning. The code is straightforward with no suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal and appears to be a simple import statement with a version identifier. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are present based on this fragment.",
