{
  "purpose": "The code imports all functions and variables from a local module named 'crypto' and defines a version string.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from .crypto import *' reads the 'crypto' module from the local package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present in this snippet; no data output, network communication, or file operations are shown.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows are present; the only operation is the import and variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('*') can be considered a bad practice, potentially hiding malicious imports, but does not in itself indicate malicious intent. The version string appears arbitrary but is standard for package versioning.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting of a single import statement and a variable assignment. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code, no network activity, no credential handling, and no suspicious behavior. The wildcard import could hide malicious imports, but with the given information, there is no evidence of malicious activity. The code does not perform any operations beyond importing and defining a version identifier.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet appears benign, with no malicious behavior or security issues evident. It simply imports a module and sets a version string. The use of wildcard import is a potential concern but not malicious per se.",
