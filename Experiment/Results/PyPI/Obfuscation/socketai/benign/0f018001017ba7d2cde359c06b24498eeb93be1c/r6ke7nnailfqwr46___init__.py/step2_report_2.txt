  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code snippets, and evaluate the scores and reasoning.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is minimal: a module import and a version string assignment.\n- The import is from a local 'crypto' module, which could contain cryptographic functions—potentially sensitive.\n- The variable name 'ZvBkONxcbqMWqwxWmaPoOMGOmaTYqmut' is obfuscated or randomly generated, which could be benign or a sign of obfuscation.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior (e.g., network activity, data exfiltration, code injection) is present in the snippet.\n- The scores for malware are all zero, indicating no malicious activity detected.\n- Obfuscation scores vary slightly, reflecting suspicion due to the variable name but not conclusive.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code snippets are straightforward and syntactically correct. No issues with code execution or logic.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None of the reports provide evidence of malicious activity. The code is minimal and benign.\n- **Trustworthiness of 'crypto' module:** Since it's a local import, its trustworthiness depends on the broader context, which isn't provided here. The code snippet alone does not indicate maliciousness.\n- **Obfuscation concern:** The variable name is obfuscated, which can be suspicious but isn't necessarily malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points on scores and reasoning:\n\n#### Malware Score:\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0 or very close to it, which is appropriate given the evidence.\n- **No signs of malware**: no network activity, no suspicious functions, no code injection, no data leaks.\n\n#### Obfuscated Score:\n- Slight variation among reports (0.2 to 0.5). The variable name is obfuscated or randomly generated, which warrants some suspicion but not enough to raise a malware flag.\n- **Score adjustment:** A score of around 0.3-0.4 seems reasonable considering the obfuscation but the lack of malicious activity.\n\n#### Security Risk Score:\n- Slightly higher (0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal concern about obfuscation and trustworthiness of the 'crypto' module.\n- The risk is low but warrants attention in a broader context.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- The reports are consistent and reasonable.\n- The main concern is the obfuscated variable name, which could be a sign of code hiding or just an auto-generated name.\n- Since there's no evidence of malicious activity, the malware score remains at 0.\n- The use of wildcard import ('*') could be a concern, but without further context, it doesn't elevate risk significantly.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Based solely on the provided snippets and reports:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0.3** (moderate suspicion due to variable name)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (minimal security concern, mainly about trustworthiness of the imported module)\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- Verify the contents of the 'crypto' module to ensure it is trustworthy.\n- Consider avoiding wildcard imports to improve code clarity and security.\n- Monitor for any obfuscated code patterns in broader codebase contexts.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is benign and straightforward. The obfuscated variable name is the only minor concern, but it does not indicate malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable, but I would slightly lower the obfuscation score to around 0.3 and keep malware at 0.\n\n**Final scores:**\n- Malware: **0**\n- Obfuscated: **0.3**\n- Risk: **0.1**",
