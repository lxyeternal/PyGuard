  "sinks": "No evident sinks or data leaks; no untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Imports data from 'crypto' module and assigns a version string, but no data flow involving untrusted sources is present.",
  "anomalies": "The variable name 'ZvBkONxcbqMWqwxWmaPoOMGOmaTYqmut' appears obfuscated or randomly generated, which could be suspicious but does not necessarily indicate malicious intent. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports everything from a local 'crypto' module, which is common for cryptographic functionalities. The version string is hardcoded with a simple value. There is no use of untrusted inputs, no network operations, no encryption/decryption calls, and no suspicious code patterns. The obfuscated variable name is unusual but does not inherently indicate malicious behavior. Overall, the code is minimal and appears benign, though the obfuscated variable name warrants attention in a broader context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward with a basic import and a version assignment. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident from this fragment. The only minor concern is the obfuscated variable name, which could be part of an attempt to hide intent but is not sufficient alone to classify as malicious.",
