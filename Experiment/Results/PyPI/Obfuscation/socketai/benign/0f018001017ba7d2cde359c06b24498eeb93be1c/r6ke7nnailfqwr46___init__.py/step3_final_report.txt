{
  "purpose": "Minimal code importing everything from a local 'crypto' module and assigning a version string to an obfuscated variable.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .crypto module, assignment to obfuscated variable",
  "sinks": "None present; no data flows to untrusted sources or external effects",
  "flows": "Import from local module; variable assignment; no external data or network activity",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable name; wildcard import potentially hiding imported names",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and syntactically correct, with no evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection. The wildcard import could be a concern but does not indicate malicious intent by itself. The obfuscated variable name raises suspicion but is likely auto-generated or for obfuscation purposes, not malicious. The version string assignment is benign. Overall, the code appears benign with a minor concern about obfuscation and import practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign, with no malicious activity detected. The obfuscated variable name warrants minor caution but does not indicate malicious intent. The overall security risk is low, and malware likelihood is negligible.",
