  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Verification**:  \n   All reports confirm that the code is a minimal snippet importing everything from a local 'crypto' module and assigning a version string to an obfuscated variable name. There are no indications of code injection, dynamic code execution, or untrusted data handling. The code appears syntactically correct and straightforward.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**:  \n   - No actual malicious behavior or vulnerabilities are evident.  \n   - The only point of concern is the obfuscated variable name, which could suggest an attempt to hide or obfuscate intent.  \n   - The use of `from .crypto import *` is generally discouraged due to potential namespace pollution, but it doesn't imply malicious activity.\n\n3. **Analysis of Scores**:  \n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign 0 or very low (0.0 to 0.2). This aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.  \n   - **Obfuscated Score**: Ranges from 0.2 to 0.5, reflecting some suspicion due to the variable name but not conclusive.  \n   - **Risk Score**: Mostly low (~0.1 to 0.2), which is reasonable given the minimal code and lack of active malicious behavior.\n\n4. **Potential Malicious Indicators**:  \n   - The obfuscated variable name could be a red flag, but without evidence of malicious activity, it remains a minor concern.  \n   - The wildcard import (`*`) could hide malicious imports, but the reports do not provide evidence supporting this.\n\n5. **Overall Consistency and Recommendations**:  \n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.  \n   - No report overstates the risk or malware potential.  \n   - The only adjustment might be to slightly increase the obfuscated score to reflect the variable name, but it's already reasonably high.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0.0** — No evidence of malicious code or behavior.  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0.3** — The variable name is suspicious but not definitively malicious.  \n- **Risk Score**: **0.1** — Overall low risk, primarily due to the obfuscation concern.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- The trustworthiness of the 'crypto' module cannot be determined from this snippet alone. If this module is third-party or untrusted, that could elevate the risk.\n- The code's simplicity suggests no active malicious behavior, but obfuscation warrants cautious monitoring.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nBased on the provided code and reports, I recommend the following scores:\n\n| Metric          | Score |\n|-----------------|--------|\n| Malware         | 0.0    |\n| Obfuscated      | 0.3    |\n| Overall Risk    | 0.1    |\n\nThis reflects a benign code snippet with a minor obfuscation concern that does not currently indicate malicious intent.",
