{
  "purpose": "The code imports all functions and classes from a module named 'crypto' and sets a version string variable.",
  "sources": "Import statement from '.crypto' module, assignment to variable 'ZvBkONxcbqMWqwxWmaPoOMGOmaTYqmut'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks, no untrusted data handling or output operations.",
  "flows": "Imports may bring in cryptographic functions; variable assignment is straightforward and does not process untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "The variable name 'ZvBkONxcbqMWqwxWmaPoOMGOmaTYqmut' appears obfuscated or randomly generated, which may indicate an attempt to hide intent, but this alone is not conclusive.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement and a variable assignment. The import from a relative module 'crypto' could be benign if the module contains legitimate cryptographic functions. The variable name appears intentionally obfuscated, which could be suspicious; however, without additional context or malicious actions, this is not definitive. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or execution of untrusted code. The code is minimal and lacks any active malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal and appears to import cryptographic functionality and set a version variable. The obfuscated variable name raises a slight concern but does not demonstrate malicious intent on its own. No malicious activity or security risks are evident from this fragment.",
  "confidence": 0.6,
