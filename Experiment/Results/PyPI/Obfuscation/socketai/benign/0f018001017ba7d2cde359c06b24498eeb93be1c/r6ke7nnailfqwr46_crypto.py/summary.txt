  "conclusion": "The code is a cryptographic utility with heavy obfuscation, no explicit malware or malicious payloads detected. Its design allows for legitimate cryptographic operations but could be misused if exploited. The malware score is low, the obfuscation score is high, and the security risk is moderate, aligning with the potential for concealment and misuse but no active malicious behavior."
