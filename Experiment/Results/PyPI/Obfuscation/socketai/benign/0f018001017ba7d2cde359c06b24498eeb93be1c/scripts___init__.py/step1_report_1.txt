{
  "purpose": "Imports all contents from the local module 'asym_crypto_yaml', likely for cryptographic operations or YAML data handling.",
  "sources": "The import statement imports code from a local module within the package; no external data input or data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network calls, file writes, or execution of untrusted code are present in this line.",
  "flows": "Since this is a simple import statement, there are no source-to-sink data flows indicated.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import 'from ... import *' can be considered poor practice but is not inherently malicious. No suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement that imports all symbols from a local module 'asym_crypto_yaml'. Without additional context or code, there's no evidence of malicious behavior. The wildcard import might conceal unnecessary or unintended code but does not directly imply malicious intent. No external data sources or dangerous sinks are involved here.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this single import statement, there are no signs of malware or malicious behavior. The code is minimal and appears to be a standard import, although the use of '*' could be considered a stylistic concern. No security risks are apparent from this snippet.",
