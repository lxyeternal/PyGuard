{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from the 'asym_crypto_yaml' module, likely to utilize cryptographic functions or data serialization related to YAML.",
  "sources": "The import statement indicates the source is the 'asym_crypto_yaml' module, which is being imported to access its functions or data.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; the code does not perform any operations, data handling, or output beyond the import.",
  "flows": "There are no execution flows, data flows, or source-to-sink paths within this single line of code.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of a relative import statement; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "This code imports all symbols from a local module named 'asym_crypto_yaml'. Without additional context or usage, it does not exhibit malicious behavior. The import may be part of larger code where cryptographic functions are used securely or potentially maliciously. Based solely on this line, there are no indicators of malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward import statement with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. It does not perform any harmful operations on its own.",
