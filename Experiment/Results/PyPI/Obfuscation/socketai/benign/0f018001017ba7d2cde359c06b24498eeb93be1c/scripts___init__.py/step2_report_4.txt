  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms the import of all symbols from a local module `asym_crypto_yaml`.\n- No external data, no sinks, flows, or suspicious activity.\n- Uses `import *`, which is stylistically discouraged but not malicious.\n- Malware score: 0, risk: 0.2, confidence: 0.6.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior; the import appears benign.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing cryptographic or serialization functions.\n- No external data or sinks.\n- Again, `import *` used, which can obscure imported symbols.\n- Malware score: 0, risk: 0.1, confidence: 0.8.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity; benign import.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same pattern: import from `asym_crypto_yaml`.\n- No suspicious patterns or data flows.\n- Slightly lower confidence but still no evidence of malicious intent.\n- Malware score: 0, risk: 0.1.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of maliciousness.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Identical to previous, no suspicious behavior.\n- Confidence is perfect (1), but still no malware.\n- Malware score: 0, risk: 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign import.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same import pattern, with a note on the use of wildcard import.\n- No data flows or malicious indicators.\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.5), but still no malware.\n- Malware score: 0, risk: 0.2.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Review & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports analyze a simple import statement: `from .asym_crypto_yaml import *`.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code in the snippet.\n- **Obfuscation:** Scores are 0 across reports, which is consistent.\n- **Risk scores:** Generally low, reflecting minimal security concern based solely on this line.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- The use of `import *` is generally discouraged because it can hide imported symbols, making the code harder to audit or potentially hiding malicious functions if they exist in the module. However, this alone does not imply malicious intent.\n- Without additional context—such as the content of `asym_crypto_yaml` or how the imported symbols are used—it's impossible to determine if malicious code exists elsewhere.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The current scores are reasonable given the limited context.\n- Since no malicious activity is evident, I would not increase malware or risk scores.\n- The obfuscation score remains at 0, which is appropriate.\n\n### Overall Estimated Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (consistent with the reports)\n\n**Summary:**  \nBased solely on this import statement, there is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk. The use of wildcard import warrants caution but is not malicious. Further analysis would require inspecting the contents of `asym_crypto_yaml` and its usage.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nIf this is the only code snippet available, I would consider it safe but recommend replacing `import *` with explicit imports for better clarity and maintainability.",
