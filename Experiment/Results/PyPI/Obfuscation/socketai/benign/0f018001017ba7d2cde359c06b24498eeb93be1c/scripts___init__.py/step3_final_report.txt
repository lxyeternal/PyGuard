  "purpose": "Import all symbols from the local module 'asym_crypto_yaml' using a relative import.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no external data sources or inputs are involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are observable in this single line.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' which can cause namespace pollution; no malicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward relative import from a local module. All reports correctly identify that this line alone does not indicate malicious behavior. The use of 'import *' is a stylistic concern but not malicious. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are evident. Malware scores are consistently zero, aligning with the benign nature of the snippet. Confidence levels are high, and risk scores are low, reflecting minimal security concern. Without inspecting the contents of 'asym_crypto_yaml', no further malicious activity can be inferred from this line.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is benign, with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. The use of wildcard import is a stylistic issue but does not pose a security threat. Overall, the code presents a very low security risk.",
