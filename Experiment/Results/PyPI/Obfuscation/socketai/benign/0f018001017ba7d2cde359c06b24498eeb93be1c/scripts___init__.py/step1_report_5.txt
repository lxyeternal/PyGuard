  "purpose": "Import all contents from the asym_crypto_yaml module",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the asym_crypto_yaml module",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present in the provided code",
  "flows": "No data flows are visible in this snippet",
  "anomalies": "Use of a wildcard import ('*') which can hide imported elements, but no malicious behavior is directly observable from this line alone",
  "analysis": "The code only contains an import statement that imports everything from a module named asym_crypto_yaml. This practice can obscure what is imported and may lead to namespace pollution, but it does not indicate malicious behavior by itself. Without additional context or code, there are no signs of malware or security risks in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no evident malicious intent or security issues. The use of wildcard import is a potential concern for code clarity but not malicious per se.",
