{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from the module 'asym_crypto_yaml', likely for cryptographic or serialization purposes.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads data from the module 'asym_crypto_yaml'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network, file writes, or data leaks are visible in this line.",
  "flows": "Not enough information; the code only contains an import statement without further logic or data flow.",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'import *' can hide imported functions or variables, but this alone is not suspicious. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious code is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of an import statement. Importing from a local module suggests reliance on external or internal code, but there is no indication of malicious behavior. The presence of a cryptography-related module ('asym_crypto_yaml') does not imply malicious intent. Without additional context or code, no suspicious or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a simple import statement with no evident malicious behavior or security risks. It is a common practice in Python projects to import modules, and there is no indication of malicious activity here.",
