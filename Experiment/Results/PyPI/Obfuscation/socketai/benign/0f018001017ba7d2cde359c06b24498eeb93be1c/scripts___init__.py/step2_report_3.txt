  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scoring and reasoning.\n\n**Code snippet under review:**\n```python\nfrom .asym_crypto_yaml import *\n```\n\n---\n\n### **General Observations:**\n- The code is a simple import statement using a relative import.\n- It imports all symbols from a local module `asym_crypto_yaml`.\n- No additional code, data flows, or external interactions are present.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Imports all from local 'asym_crypto_yaml', likely for cryptography or YAML handling.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, just a wildcard import. The use of '*' is stylistically discouraged but not malicious.\n- **Confidence:** 0.6\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 (slightly elevated due to wildcard import concern, but not a direct risk)\n- **Verdict:** **Reasonable.** No malware or malicious intent detected.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** Again, a simple import statement. No suspicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (low)\n- **Verdict:** **Appropriate.** No signs of malware.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious indicators; just a wildcard import.\n- **Confidence:** 0.6\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n- **Verdict:** **Consistent.** No malware or malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious activity; just an import.\n- **Confidence:** 1 (high confidence)\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Verdict:** **Appropriate.** No malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Same.\n- **Analysis:** Same reasoning; no malicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** 0.5 (moderate confidence)\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 (still low)\n- **Verdict:** **Reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n### **Critical Evaluation & Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Presence of malware?** All reports indicate no malware, which aligns with the code snippet.\n- **Obfuscation?** None; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** All are low, which is appropriate given the minimal code.\n\n**Potential concerns:**\n- The use of `import *` is generally discouraged because it can hide imported symbols, but it is not inherently malicious.\n- The module `asym_crypto_yaml` suggests cryptographic functionality, but importing it alone doesn't imply malicious intent unless further code is examined.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at **0** across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** Should be **0**.\n- **Risk score:** Given the minimal code and no malicious indicators, a **risk score of 0.1** or **0** seems more appropriate. The existing scores are slightly higher but still low, which is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Justification:**\n\n- The code snippet is benign; it only imports a module.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or suspicious patterns.\n- The use of wildcard import is a stylistic concern but not a security risk.\n- The module name suggests cryptography, but mere import does not imply misuse.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Estimated Scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| **0**   | **0**        | **0.1** |\n\nThese reflect a conservative, security-focused stance, emphasizing that no malicious activity is detected based solely on this import statement.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always review the contents of `asym_crypto_yaml` to ensure it doesn't contain malicious code, but based on the provided snippet, there's no reason to suspect malicious intent.",
