{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from the asym_crypto_yaml module, likely for cryptographic or YAML processing functions.",
  "sources": "The import statement is the source, which loads external code from a local or installed module.",
  "sinks": "Not applicable directly; no data processing or external output shown in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Not enough code to identify any data flow or untrusted data paths.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' can obscure which functions or variables are brought into scope, potentially hiding malicious or unintended code. However, this alone is common in some codebases and not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "This code only contains an import statement from a local or package module. There are no signs of suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior in this single line. The use of a relative import indicates it's part of a larger package or module. Without additional context, no malicious intent can be inferred. The import itself is standard practice and does not pose a security risk by itself.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided line, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a straightforward import statement, with no indications of malware or security issues.",
