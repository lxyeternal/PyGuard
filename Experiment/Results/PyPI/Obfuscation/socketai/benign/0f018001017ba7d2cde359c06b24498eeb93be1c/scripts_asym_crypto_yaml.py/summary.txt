  "conclusion": "The code is a cryptographic CLI utility with heavily obfuscated function names, which warrants caution. There is no evidence of malicious activity such as network communication, data exfiltration, or system compromise within this snippet. The main risk stems from reliance on external functions that should be reviewed for security. The low malware scores are justified; the high obfuscation scores indicate suspicion but are not proof of malicious intent."
