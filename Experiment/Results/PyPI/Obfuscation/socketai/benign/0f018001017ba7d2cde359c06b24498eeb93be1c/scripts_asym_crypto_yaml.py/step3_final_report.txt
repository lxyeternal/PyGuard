{
  "purpose": "The code provides a command-line interface for cryptographic key management, secret handling, and YAML encryption/decryption, relying on external cryptographic functions.",
  "sources": "User input prompts for secrets, file paths for keys and secrets, and external functions imported from asym_crypto_yaml.",
  "sinks": "External functions that perform cryptographic operations; no direct sinks like network calls or system modifications are visible.",
  "flows": "Input data (secrets, keys) flows from user prompts or files into external cryptographic functions; obfuscated function calls process data without visible internal logic.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated function and variable names, reliance on external modules with unknown implementations, no inline cryptographic logic or network activity, standard handling of secrets via prompts.",
  "analysis": "The script acts as a CLI wrapper around cryptographic functions, with obfuscated identifiers that could be used to hide malicious code. No malicious network activity or system modifications are evident. The core cryptographic logic resides in external functions whose security and integrity cannot be assessed here. The obfuscation is suspicious but not conclusive of malicious intent. The low malware scores across reports align with the absence of direct malicious indicators. The high obfuscation scores reflect the naming patterns. Overall, the code appears to be a cryptographic utility with potential obfuscation concerns but no active malicious behavior in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a cryptographic CLI utility with heavily obfuscated function names, which warrants caution. There is no evidence of malicious activity such as network communication, data exfiltration, or system compromise within this snippet. The main risk stems from reliance on external functions that should be reviewed for security. The low malware scores are justified; the high obfuscation scores indicate suspicion but are not proof of malicious intent.",
