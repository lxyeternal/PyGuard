      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is an obfuscated, incomplete setup script with no evidence of malware or malicious intent. The obfuscation appears superficial or a result of code corruption. The syntax errors and suspicious import statements suggest either poorly written, intentionally obfuscated, or corrupted code. The overall security risk remains low, but the obfuscation and syntax irregularities should be addressed for clarity and proper execution."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is a cryptographic utility with heavy obfuscation, no explicit malware or malicious payloads detected. Its design allows for legitimate cryptographic operations but could be misused if exploited. The malware score is low, the obfuscation score is high, and the security risk is moderate, aligning with the potential for concealment and misuse but no active malicious behavior."

      "obfuscated": 0.7,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is a cryptographic CLI utility with heavily obfuscated function names, which warrants caution. There is no evidence of malicious activity such as network communication, data exfiltration, or system compromise within this snippet. The main risk stems from reliance on external functions that should be reviewed for security. The low malware scores are justified; the high obfuscation scores indicate suspicion but are not proof of malicious intent."

      "confidence": 1,
      "conclusion": "The import statement is benign, with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. The use of wildcard import is a stylistic issue but does not pose a security threat. Overall, the code presents a very low security risk."
