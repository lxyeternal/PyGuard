  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to perform some data processing or utility functions based on its structure and imports.",
  "sources": "Data is read from environment variables, files, or function inputs. Specific input sources are not detailed in the visible code snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writing, or data output functions, but no explicit malicious sink is identified.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (environment variables, files, or user input) through internal processing functions to output or external connections.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs are evident. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution appears present. The code structure is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "A thorough review of the code shows standard Python constructs, no suspicious imports or functions, and no signs of malicious behavior such as network exfiltration or system manipulation. No hidden or obfuscated code segments are detected. The code seems to follow typical patterns for a utility or processing script. Without external context or hidden code, the likelihood of malicious intent is low.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with no evident malicious behavior or security risks. It is a typical utility script with no signs of sabotage or malware. The overall security risk is minimal.",
