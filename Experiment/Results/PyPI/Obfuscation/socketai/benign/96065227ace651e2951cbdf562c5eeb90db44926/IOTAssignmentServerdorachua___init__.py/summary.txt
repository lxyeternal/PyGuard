  "security_risk": 0.5,
  "obfuscated": 0.6,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "Most reports are consistent with their assessments; suspicious features like eval/exec and obfuscation justify higher risk scores. Minor adjustments, such as increasing malware score in Report 4 to 0.1, improve accuracy. Overall, the code appears to have low malicious intent unless runtime evidence suggests otherwise."
