{
  "purpose": "The code is for setting up a Python package named 'IOTAssignmentServerdorachua' with specified metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file and hardcoded string literals for package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data is used in a way that affects system security or leaks data.",
  "flows": "File content read as source; no data flows to sinks that could cause security issues.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names such as 'AYbtZDkUOHffuPyPYvfbWwurnkrDrdrr' and 'FXfbsfpTtLbEVNyYecCgsZwGxYzvTbvd' are unusual and suggest obfuscation or masking of data. The code appears standard for package setup with no malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a typical package setup process, reading a README file and calling setuptools.setup() with package metadata and dependencies. The variable names used for package description and author name are unusually obfuscated, which is atypical for clear, maintainable code but not inherently malicious. No untrusted data sources, network activity, or suspicious logic are present. The dependencies are standard libraries and no suspicious package names are included. The code is straightforward with no hidden behaviors or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with obfuscated variable names but no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a normal package configuration with no malicious intent.",
