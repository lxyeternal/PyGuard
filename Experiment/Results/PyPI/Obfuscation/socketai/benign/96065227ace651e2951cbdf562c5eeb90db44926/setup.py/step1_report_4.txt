{
  "purpose": "This code is intended to set up a Python package named 'IOTAssignmentServerdorachua' with specified metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads the contents of 'README.md' and uses it as the long description for the package.",
  "targets": "The setup configuration does not explicitly process untrusted input beyond static values; it primarily loads a local file and defines package metadata.",
  "flows": "The content read from 'README.md' (source) is assigned to the long_description parameter (sink) in the setup call. No further data flows are apparent.",
  "anomalies": "The variable names assigned to the read file content are obfuscated (e.g., AYbtZDkUOHffuPyPYvfbWwurnkrDrdrr), which may indicate code obfuscation, but no malicious code or secrets are present. The setup parameters are static and do not contain embedded secrets or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup procedures: it reads a README file and configures package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. The variable naming appears intentionally obfuscated, but all operations are typical for a setup script. There is no evidence of data exfiltration, backdoors, malicious network activity, or code injection. The dependencies are common packages; no suspicious or malicious behaviors are introduced.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a normal setup script with obfuscated variable names, which do not indicate malicious intent. No malware or security risks are detected. The obfuscation seems intended to obscure variable names but does not imply malicious behavior.",
