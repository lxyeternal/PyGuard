  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script using setuptools, reading README.md for long description, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file; static strings for package info; dependencies listed explicitly.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, no handling of secrets or user data.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names (e.g., AYbtZDkUOHffuPyPYvfbWwurnkrDrdrr), which are unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with obfuscated variable names. No malicious code, network activity, or untrusted data handling is present. Dependencies are standard. Obfuscation does not imply malicious intent; it may be stylistic or accidental. No signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior are detected. The obfuscation is moderate, but given the benign context, it does not elevate security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a standard package setup with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malware or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation is likely stylistic rather than malicious. The current scores are appropriate, with malware and security risk scores at 0, and a moderate obfuscation score reflecting the variable naming.",
