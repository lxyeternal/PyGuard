{
  "purpose": "Telemetry data management: retrieving maximum seconds from telemetry and inserting socket feed data with timestamps.",
  "sources": "Database queries retrieving max seconds; data used for timestamp calculations.",
  "sinks": "Database insertions for socket feed data; no external data sinks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Source data (max seconds, timestamps) flows into database retrieval and insertion operations.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names; broad exception handling; no hardcoded secrets; no external network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard database operations with parameterized queries, reducing injection risk. Obfuscation is present but not evidence of malicious intent. No signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or sabotage. Exception handling is broad but not malicious. No external communications or system modifications are detected. The obfuscation could be superficial or used to hide malicious code, but no such activity is evident in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate telemetry data handler with superficial obfuscation. No malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage is detected. The security risk is low, and malware likelihood is minimal.",
