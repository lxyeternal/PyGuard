      "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a standard package setup with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malware or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation is likely stylistic rather than malicious. The current scores are appropriate, with malware and security risk scores at 0, and a moderate obfuscation score reflecting the variable naming."

      "obfuscated": 0.8,
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate telemetry data retrieval class with obfuscated naming and a print statement that could leak sensitive information. No malicious activity or malware is detected. The primary concern is the potential leakage of internal data via the print statement, but this does not constitute malicious behavior. The supply chain security risk is low, with the main recommendation being to remove or secure the print statement to prevent data leaks."

      "obfuscated": 0.8,
      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "While the code's obfuscation and incomplete snippets raise suspicion, there is no direct evidence of malicious activity. The broad exception handling and opaque method calls suggest potential concealment, warranting caution. The low malware score (0.2) aligns with the absence of explicit malicious actions, but the high obfuscation score (~0.75) reflects the difficulty in analysis. The moderate security risk (~0.35) is justified by the obfuscation and network handling without validation. Further investigation into the feeder object implementations and the full application context is recommended to confirm the absence of malicious behavior."

      "obfuscated": 0.6,
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "Most reports are consistent with their assessments; suspicious features like eval/exec and obfuscation justify higher risk scores. Minor adjustments, such as increasing malware score in Report 4 to 0.1, improve accuracy. Overall, the code appears to have low malicious intent unless runtime evidence suggests otherwise."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for telemetry data management with obfuscation, not exhibiting signs of malware or malicious sabotage. The primary security considerations involve the obfuscation level and external dependencies, which should be reviewed further. The malware score is set to 0, the obfuscation score is high (~0.7), and the risk score is moderate (~0.3), reflecting potential concerns but no active threats."

      "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated with suspicious import names and undefined variables, raising concerns about concealment. However, no direct evidence of malicious activity is present in the snippets. The high obfuscation justifies a cautious approach, but the low malware likelihood suggests the code is not actively malicious based on static analysis. Continuous runtime monitoring and further investigation into external modules are recommended."

      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "While the code does not show explicit malicious payloads, the high level of obfuscation, suspicious recursive functions, and structural anomalies warrant caution. The recursive functions could cause resource exhaustion, and obfuscation may hide malicious logic or backdoors. The overall security risk is moderate, primarily due to potential misuse or sabotage facilitated by code complexity and infinite recursion risks. Further dynamic analysis and runtime monitoring are recommended before deployment or trust in this code."
