  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated with suspicious import names and undefined variables, raising concerns about concealment. However, no direct evidence of malicious activity is present in the snippets. The high obfuscation justifies a cautious approach, but the low malware likelihood suggests the code is not actively malicious based on static analysis. Continuous runtime monitoring and further investigation into external modules are recommended."
