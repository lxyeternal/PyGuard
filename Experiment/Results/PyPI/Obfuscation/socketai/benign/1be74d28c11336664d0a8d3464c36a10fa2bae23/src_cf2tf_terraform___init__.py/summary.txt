  "conclusion": "The code shows no evidence of malicious intent or backdoors. Slight obfuscation is noted but not sufficient to raise high suspicion. Security risks are low, and the scores across reports are appropriate. Minor adjustments, such as lowering Report 3's obfuscation score to 0.2, could improve consistency, but overall, the assessments are sound."
