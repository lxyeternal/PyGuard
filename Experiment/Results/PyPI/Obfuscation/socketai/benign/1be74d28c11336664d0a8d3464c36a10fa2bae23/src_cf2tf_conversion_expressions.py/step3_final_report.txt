  "purpose": "Utility functions for converting CloudFormation intrinsic functions into Terraform expressions, performing input validation and string formatting.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions, such as lists, strings, and intrinsic function values.",
  "sinks": "String formatting operations, returning expression objects or strings; no external data or system calls.",
  "flows": "Input validation -> string formatting -> return expression objects or strings.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of heavily obfuscated variable names, verbose and inconsistent docstrings, and one function referencing an undefined variable 'condition', indicating a bug but not malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple functions validating input types and lengths, then formatting strings to represent Terraform expressions. Obfuscated variable names suggest intentional obfuscation or code minification. No network activity, external data leaks, or malicious payloads are detected. The undefined variable 'condition' in one function is a coding bug, not malicious. The overall structure and operations are benign, serving as conversion utilities. The obfuscation does not correlate with malicious behavior, and no signs of backdoors or data exfiltration are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions for IaC conversion, with obfuscated variable names but no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The high obfuscation score is justified by variable naming and verbose comments, but it does not indicate malicious intent. The malware score is zero, and the security risk is low (~0.2). The only notable issue is a bug in one function, which should be fixed for correctness but does not impact security.",
