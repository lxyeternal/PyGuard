  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python code snippets related to CloudFormation template handling, primarily documentation and incomplete code fragments.",
  "sources": "Input parameter validation, variable assignments, and documentation comments within the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or external data flows identified; code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No executable logic; the code is mainly documentation or placeholder variables with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, duplicated 'Args' and 'Raises' sections, malformed documentation, incomplete code fragments.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets are primarily incomplete, documentation-oriented, with obfuscated or placeholder variable names. No executable logic, network activity, or data processing is present. The obfuscation appears superficial, likely due to auto-generation or poor formatting, rather than malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The high obfuscation scores are justified by variable naming and documentation issues, but these do not indicate malicious activity. Malware scores are consistently zero, and security risks are minimal, mostly reflecting poor coding practices rather than security threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets are benign, lacking any malicious or security-compromising behavior. The obfuscation and poor documentation are artifacts of code quality issues, not malicious intent. Scores are appropriate: malware at 0, obfuscated at approximately 0.6-0.75, and security risk at 0.1-0.2.",
