{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a function or method that processes CloudFormation templates, likely for testing or validation purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the 'template' argument, which should be a dictionary, and optionally from 'imports', which should also be a dictionary. It also reads 'template_path', which is a string or Path object.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are visible; potential risks could occur if untrusted input is used insecurely in subsequent code (not shown). No code execution, network calls, or data leaks are evident in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Input data from 'template' and 'imports' flows into validation logic (TypeError checks). The 'template_path' may be used later to load or process files, but this is not shown. No sensitive data flows are apparent.",
  "anomalies": "The code snippet contains duplicated 'Args' and 'Raises' sections, which suggests incomplete or poorly formatted documentation rather than malicious behavior. There is no evidence of obfuscated or malicious code logic.",
  "analysis": "The provided code snippet is part of a documentation or docstring, not executable logic. It details input parameters and expected behavior but does not contain any actual code that could be malicious. The presence of redundant 'Args' and 'Raises' sections indicates possible formatting issues, but no malicious activity or suspicious behavior is observed.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is simply documentation describing a function's interface, with no executable code. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this fragment.",
