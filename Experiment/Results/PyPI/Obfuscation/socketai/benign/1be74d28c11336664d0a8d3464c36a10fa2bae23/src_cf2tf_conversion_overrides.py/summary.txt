  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate set of utility functions for infrastructure configuration processing, with obfuscation that may be intentional or incidental. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is correctly set to 0. The obfuscation score is high but justified given the naming patterns. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use in infrastructure automation."
