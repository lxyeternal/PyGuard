{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for transforming AWS resource configurations, specifically handling access controls, policy documents, and tags within infrastructure as code templates.",
  "sources": "Input dictionaries such as 'AccessControl', 'PolicyDocument', and 'Tags', as well as external functions like 'render', 'jsonencode', and custom functions for encoding and processing data.",
  "sinks": "Modifications to input dictionaries, including replacing 'AccessControl' with 'acl', encoding 'PolicyDocument', and restructuring 'Tags', which could influence resource deployment but do not pose security risks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input dictionaries through functions that encode, transform, and assign values, such as converting access control strings to internal representations, encoding policies, and restructuring tags.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of highly obfuscated variable and function names, broad exception handling that suppresses errors, and redundant 'raise Exception' statements after 'try-except' blocks, indicating obfuscation or poor coding practices but not malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data transformations for AWS resource configurations, with obfuscated naming likely due to code obfuscation or auto-generation. No network activity, system modifications, or malicious behaviors are evident. Error handling is broad, which could mask issues but is common in configuration utilities. The functions do not handle secrets or credentials and do not perform any external communication.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate set of utility functions for infrastructure configuration processing, with obfuscation that may be intentional or incidental. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is correctly set to 0. The obfuscation score is high but justified given the naming patterns. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use in infrastructure automation.",
