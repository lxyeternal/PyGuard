  "conclusion": "Based on the provided descriptions, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The security risk remains minimal. Scores should reflect the absence of concrete code, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and risk scores kept low (around 0.1–0.2). Slight adjustments to confidence levels in some reports are recommended to better match the speculative nature of their assessments."
