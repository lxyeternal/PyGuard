  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided code snippets or descriptions.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include environment variables, files, network connections, and external inputs.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks involve network transmissions, file operations, and data processing functions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or network inputs to sinks like network transmissions or file writes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; absence of code or suspicious patterns; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "All reports lack actual code snippets, relying on descriptions. The assessments correctly identify the absence of malicious activity and appropriately assign low malware and obfuscation scores. Confidence levels vary but are generally justified; some reports overestimate security risk due to cautious assumptions without concrete evidence. The reasoning is consistent and aligns with the lack of code, with minor overconfidence in some cases.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided descriptions, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The security risk remains minimal. Scores should reflect the absence of concrete code, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and risk scores kept low (around 0.1–0.2). Slight adjustments to confidence levels in some reports are recommended to better match the speculative nature of their assessments.",
