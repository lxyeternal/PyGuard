  "conclusion": "The static analysis indicates no evidence of malware or malicious sabotage. The obfuscation is notable but not sufficient to classify the code as malicious. The scores assigned are appropriate: low malware (0), high obfuscation (0.8), low security risk (0.2). Further dynamic or module-level analysis would be necessary for absolute certainty, but based on this review, the code is likely benign with respect to supply chain security."
