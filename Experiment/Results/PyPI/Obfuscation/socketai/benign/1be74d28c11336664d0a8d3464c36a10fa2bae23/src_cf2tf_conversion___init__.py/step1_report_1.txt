  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be a Python package intended for general functionality, possibly related to data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, function parameters, and possibly external data files or network responses (if present in the code).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, system commands, or data leaks through logs or prints.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (e.g., user input, environment variables) through processing functions to sinks (e.g., network, file, system calls).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious imports, obfuscated code, or unusual dynamic execution are observed. Code structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is analyzed for typical malicious indicators such as hardcoded secrets, malicious network activity, or system modifications. No such behavior is detected. Usage of third-party libraries is standard, and no signs of obfuscation or malware-related patterns are present. The code primarily performs expected operations without suspicious data handling or security flaws. The absence of hardcoded credentials or malicious network activity suggests low likelihood of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no evident malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as intended without any suspicious anomalies or backdoors.",
