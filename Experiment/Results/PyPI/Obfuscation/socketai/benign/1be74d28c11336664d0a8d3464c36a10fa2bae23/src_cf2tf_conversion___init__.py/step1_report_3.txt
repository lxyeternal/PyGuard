  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be related to data processing or utility functions, but the specific intent cannot be determined due to the absence of comments or explicit function names.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include environment variables, possibly network inputs, or file reads (not explicitly visible in the snippet).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could involve network connections, file writes, or environment variable manipulations, but specific sinks are not evident from the provided code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (such as environment variables or files) to processing functions and possibly to outputs like network or file systems.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic code execution are present. The code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and does not contain any malicious patterns. No signs of obfuscation, malicious API calls, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident. Usage of third-party libraries appears legitimate. The code does not perform dangerous operations such as network tunneling, unauthorized file access, or system modifications. The lack of comments and detailed logic limits full understanding, but nothing suspicious stands out.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign and aligned with standard practices, with no evidence of malware or security issues.",
