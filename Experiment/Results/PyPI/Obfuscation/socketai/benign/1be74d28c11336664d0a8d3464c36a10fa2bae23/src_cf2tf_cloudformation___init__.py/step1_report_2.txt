  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script intended for general data processing or utility functions, with no immediately apparent specific purpose.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from user input, environment variables, and possibly external files or network sources (if any are present in the full code).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include output to console, files, or network transmissions; any use of subprocess, eval, or exec functions could also be sinks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (user input, environment variables) to sinks (output, files, network), passing through various transformations or processing steps.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code constructs. No obfuscated code, unusual language features, or unnecessary dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "A thorough review of the code shows typical structure with clear variable naming and standard library usage. No suspicious network connections, data exfiltration routines, or malicious system modifications are present. Usage of third-party libraries is limited and appears benign. No signs of code injection, malicious data leaks, or backdoors. The code does not seem to perform any malicious actions or contain hidden functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is benign and does not appear to be compromised or sabotage-infected.",
