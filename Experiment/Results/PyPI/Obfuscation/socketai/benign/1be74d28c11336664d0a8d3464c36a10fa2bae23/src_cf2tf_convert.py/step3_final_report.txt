{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a CloudFormation to Terraform converter, parsing templates, resources, parameters, and documentation to generate Terraform configurations.",
  "sources": "Functions reading input data include template section parsers, resource and parameter extraction, and documentation file readers.",
  "sinks": "Data flows into resource objects, configuration blocks, and logs; no system calls, network activity, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Sources feed into parsing functions, which process and transform data into resource/resource-like objects, then into configuration structures.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with nonsensical variable names and complex string operations; some functions appear incomplete or nonsensical, but no active malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is heavily obfuscated, making intent less transparent. It performs parsing, validation, and override application without system calls or network activity. The obfuscation could be used to conceal malicious logic, but no evidence of such is present. The functions handle data transformation, string matching, and configuration generation, which are typical for infrastructure-as-code tools. The lack of malicious signals, combined with the obfuscation, warrants cautious interpretation but does not confirm malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a complex, obfuscated infrastructure conversion utility with no explicit malicious activity. The high obfuscation warrants caution, but no active malicious behavior is evident. The overall malware score should be set very low, with a high obfuscation score reflecting the code's obscurity. The security risk remains low but warrants review due to obfuscation.",
