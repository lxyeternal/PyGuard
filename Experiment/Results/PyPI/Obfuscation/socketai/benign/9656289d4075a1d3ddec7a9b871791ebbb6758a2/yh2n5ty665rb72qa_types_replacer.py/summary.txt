  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated data normalization utility that performs pattern matching and string mapping without any signs of malicious activity or supply chain security threats. The obfuscation may be for concealment or complexity but does not inherently indicate malicious intent. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is moderate, and security risk is low."
