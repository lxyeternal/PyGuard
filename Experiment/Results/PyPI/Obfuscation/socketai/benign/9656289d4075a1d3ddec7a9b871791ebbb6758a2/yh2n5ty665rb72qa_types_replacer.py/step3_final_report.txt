  "purpose": "Data normalization and pattern matching for string forms, mapping forms to main types.",
  "sources": "Dictionary keys and values, input strings to regex substitution.",
  "sinks": "Regex substitution functions, dictionary updates.",
  "flows": "Input strings are matched against regex patterns, then replaced or mapped via dictionary lookups.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation through variable names and class names; use of regex for pattern matching; warnings for null normalized forms.",
  "analysis": "The code performs string normalization based on predefined types and forms, utilizing regex for pattern matching and substitution. It maintains mappings of normalized forms to main types, with obfuscated variable names that could be an attempt to conceal complexity. No network, file, or system modification activities are present. The use of caching via lru_cache improves efficiency. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious payloads. Warnings for null normalized forms are standard. The obfuscation is notable but not indicative of malicious intent. The overall logic is consistent with benign data processing, with no external communication or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated data normalization utility that performs pattern matching and string mapping without any signs of malicious activity or supply chain security threats. The obfuscation may be for concealment or complexity but does not inherently indicate malicious intent. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is moderate, and security risk is low.",
