  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script with obfuscated variable names and a hardcoded string that may resemble a secret or credential.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file, parameters passed to setup(), including the hardcoded string 'yh2n5ty665rb72qa'.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of the hardcoded string as a secret or credential; no other untrusted data sources or external communications detected.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' into a variable; passing the secret string as a parameter in setup(); no further data flows or external interactions observed.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; presence of a hardcoded string that resembles a secret; reading a file into a variable that isn't used elsewhere.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with superficial obfuscation and a suspicious string. No network activity, code injection, or malicious operations are evident. The obfuscation and secret-like string raise some concern, primarily about secret exposure. The scores assigned in the reports are generally appropriate; the malware score remains low due to lack of active malicious behavior. The obfuscation score is justified by variable naming. The security risk score should be slightly elevated due to the hardcoded secret, which could be a vulnerability if it is indeed sensitive. Overall, the code appears benign but warrants caution regarding the secret string.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with superficial obfuscation and a potentially sensitive hardcoded string. No malicious activity is detected, but the presence of the secret warrants further review. The overall security risk is moderate, primarily due to the secret exposure risk. The obfuscation does not imply malicious intent but should be scrutinized if the secret is sensitive.",
