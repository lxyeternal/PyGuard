{
  "purpose": "A static, multilingual dictionary mapping abbreviations to full forms of organizational types, likely used for classification or recognition purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads from an imported object 'mxtXOnOuSvJFpFfyuuOnGUgIMQDgIlWj' and defines a large dictionary assigned to the same variable.",
  "sinks": "No dynamic data handling, external data input, or code execution present; static data only.",
  "flows": "The dictionary is assigned directly; no data flows from external sources or user input.",
  "anomalies": "The variable name and import path are intentionally obfuscated or auto-generated; no malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static data structure with multilingual entries, containing no executable code, network activity, or external interactions. The import is unused, and the variable name appears intentionally obfuscated, which could be a size or obfuscation technique but does not imply malicious intent. The dataset's content is consistent with internationalization or classification data, with no signs of code injection, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The high obfuscation score in some reports is justified by the variable naming but does not indicate malicious activity. The malware score remains at 0, and the overall security risk is negligible.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a static resource for organization type recognition. No malicious activity, code injection, or dynamic behavior is present. The obfuscated variable name is likely intentional or autogenerated, not malicious. The security assessment should assign a malware score of 0, a low obfuscation score (~0.3), and a risk score of 0.",
