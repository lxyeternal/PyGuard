  "purpose": "String normalization and sanitization for consistent data processing, including case normalization, bracket removal, duplicate token elimination, and optional token sorting or space collapsing.",
  "sources": "Input string parameter, functions that process string data (e.g., XqzGioHoDHeNEpmusCreEqmICXjbkldw, chSgODmaxhZrsymOsUetpyikXIxWZAAb, BcqTrCabIhJgtcKFviOIxVdyndqblUTl, QjylmCOHpASRCispgZSlqKfVEqhHzAdP).",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; the code processes data internally without network, file, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input string -> normalization and cleaning functions -> optional bracket removal -> case normalization -> duplicate removal or sorting -> output string.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of variable and function names; no malicious code or suspicious operations detected; reliance on external, similarly obfuscated helper functions.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard string normalization tasks with heavily obfuscated identifiers, which could be for proprietary or privacy reasons. No network, file, or system modifications are present. The functions invoked are likely string helpers, not malicious. The obfuscation raises a red flag but does not inherently indicate malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the code as benign string processing, with high confidence and low malware risk scores. The obfuscation score is high, reflecting the naming style, but the overall behavior is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign string normalization utility with obfuscated naming. No evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or malicious payloads is present. The obfuscation is likely stylistic or proprietary, not malicious. The current scores accurately reflect this assessment.",
