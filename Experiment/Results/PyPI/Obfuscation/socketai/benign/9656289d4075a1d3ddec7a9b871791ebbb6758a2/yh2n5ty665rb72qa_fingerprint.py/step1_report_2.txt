  "purpose": "This function processes and normalizes input strings for further use, likely for consistent formatting or comparison purposes.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'yMEsLzyFxkpwXliefoXfegUifFaGzPAD' and the functions called on it, such as stringify, XqzGioHoDHeNEpmusCreEqmICXjbkldw, BcqTrCabIhJgtcKFviOIxVdyndqblUTl, QjylmCOHpASRCispgZSlqKfVEqhHzAdP, and string splitting/joining operations.",
  "sinks": "Return value of the function after processing, which outputs a normalized string. No untrusted data sinks or external calls are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through multiple transformation functions, including normalization, cleanup, case conversion, and formatting (sorting and joining).",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated variable names, no explicit security-sensitive operations, and the absence of network or file I/O. The code appears to focus on string manipulation without malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code takes an optional string input, applies normalization and cleanup functions, converts it to lowercase, removes brackets if specified, sorts and joins parts of the string if required, and ensures the output is meaningful. The variable names are intentionally obscure, but the operations themselves are typical string processing tasks. There are no signs of malicious code such as network calls, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The functions invoked could be benign helpers for string processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate string normalization utility with no evidence of malicious behavior. The obfuscation is likely intentional for code privacy or stylistic reasons, not for malicious intent. There are no malicious signals or suspicious activities identified.",
