It logs duplicate occurrences via print statements. The code operates solely on local files and performs no network or code injection activities. Variable names are intentionally obfuscated, which can be suspicious but is not inherently malicious. The file is opened in binary mode ('wb') for writing YAML data, which is unconventional but not harmful. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. The use of 'yaml.safe_load' and safe dump options mitigate YAML injection risks. The filename is imported from an external module, which could be manipulated externally, but this is typical in configuration scripts. Overall, the code appears to be a benign utility for data normalization with obfuscation, and no malicious activity is evident.\",\n  \"conclusion\": \"The code is a legitimate YAML data normalization and validation utility. Despite obfuscated variable names, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security vulnerabilities. The high obfuscation score reflects variable naming but does not imply malicious intent. The malware score remains at 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2), assuming the filename variable is controlled in a trusted environment.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.9,\n  \"obfuscated\": 0.75,\n  \"malware\": 0,\n  \"securityRisk\": 0.2\n}",
