  "purpose": "Read, process, and modify a YAML file containing data with 'types' and 'forms', checking for duplicate entries, and rewriting the data.",
  "sources": "Reading from a file specified by a variable imported from a module; loading data via yaml.safe_load.",
  "sinks": "Writing the processed data back to a file, potentially overwriting the original.",
  "flows": "File read -> data processing -> file write.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic data processing, no hardcoded credentials or secret keys, no external network connections, no suspicious file operations beyond standard read/write.",
  "analysis": "The code loads YAML data from a file, processes 'types' and their 'forms' to identify duplicates, and sorts the data before overwriting the same file. It performs duplicate detection via print statements but does not modify or exfiltrate data beyond local processing. No code injection, network activity, or malicious system modifications are observed. It relies on external variables for file paths but does not show any malicious behavior associated with these variables. No obfuscated code or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to perform straightforward data validation and sorting tasks on a YAML file. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. The code functions solely to process and overwrite data locally, with no network activity or malicious behavior evident.",
