{
  "purpose": "The code performs text normalization, specifically removing prefixes like Mr., Mrs., etc., and cleaning up whitespace and category replacements.",
  "sources": "Input strings processed through regex patterns, normalization functions, and constants imported from external modules.",
  "sinks": "Internal string processing functions; no external data flows or system interactions.",
  "flows": "Input strings are cleaned and normalized via regex substitution, category replacement, and caching functions; no external sinks involved.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names and imported constants, but no suspicious URLs, credentials, or payloads. The obfuscation appears superficial.",
  "analysis": "The code uses regex to strip prefixes, normalizes text by removing whitespace and category replacements, and caches results for efficiency. No network activity, file operations, or system modifications are present. Obfuscated variable names suggest an attempt to obscure intent but do not indicate malicious behavior. The functions serve typical data cleaning purposes. The overall logic is benign, and no malicious or security-compromising actions are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign text normalization utility with superficial obfuscation. No signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities are detected. The high obfuscation scores are justified by variable naming but do not imply malicious intent. The overall security risk is minimal.",
