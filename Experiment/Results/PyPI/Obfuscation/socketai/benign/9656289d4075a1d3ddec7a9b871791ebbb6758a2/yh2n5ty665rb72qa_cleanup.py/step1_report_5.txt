{
  "purpose": "The code appears to process and normalize text data, likely for cleaning or standardizing input such as names or titles.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function arguments (strings), and environment or system data is not accessed.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network, file, or database operations are present; data is processed and returned within functions.",
  "flows": "Input strings are normalized through removal of special characters, lowercasing, category replacements, and space collapsing within functions.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains several obfuscated variable and function names, and large, seemingly random constant imports from a module. These may indicate attempts at hiding intent. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The use of regex to strip prefixes like titles is normal. No malicious code behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly performs text normalization, including removing prefixes like 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', etc., and cleaning up input text for further processing. Functions utilize caching to optimize repeated operations, and regex is used for pattern matching. The presence of obfuscated variable names and imported constants suggests either obfuscation or lack of code clarity, but nothing malicious. No external data or system control flows, no data exfiltration, network activity, or destructive commands are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily focused on text normalization and cleaning. Its obfuscated style does not inherently indicate malicious intent, and no harmful behaviors or malicious patterns are detected.",
