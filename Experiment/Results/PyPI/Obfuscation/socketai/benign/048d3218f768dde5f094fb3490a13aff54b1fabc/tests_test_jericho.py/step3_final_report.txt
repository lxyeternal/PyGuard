  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, function parameters, user input, external files, network sockets, subprocess calls, eval/exec statements.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file writing, subprocess execution, environment variable access, potential data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables and user input flow into network sockets, subprocesses, or file outputs; eval/exec may execute untrusted code, leading to potential malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded credentials, eval/exec usage, obfuscation techniques, suspicious domain/IP references, unsafe subprocess calls, dynamic code execution without validation.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits behaviors such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic execution, obfuscation, and network activity indicative of potential malicious intent. Reports with high suspicion (e.g., Report 5) align with these indicators, warranting high malware and risk scores. Benign reports lack such features and are scored accordingly. Slight adjustments, such as lowering the obfuscation score in Report 2 from 0.6 to 0.5, improve consistency. Overall, the assessments are coherent with the described behaviors, and the scores reflect the potential threat levels appropriately.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits varying degrees of suspicion, with some reports indicating benign behavior and others showing significant malicious indicators. The overall threat level is moderate to high, primarily driven by reports with network activity, hardcoded secrets, and dynamic code execution. The scoring system is consistent with these observations, with minor adjustments to better align the scores with the described behaviors.",
