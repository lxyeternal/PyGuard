  "conclusion": "The code exhibits varying degrees of suspicion, with some reports indicating benign behavior and others showing significant malicious indicators. The overall threat level is moderate to high, primarily driven by reports with network activity, hardcoded secrets, and dynamic code execution. The scoring system is consistent with these observations, with minor adjustments to better align the scores with the described behaviors."
