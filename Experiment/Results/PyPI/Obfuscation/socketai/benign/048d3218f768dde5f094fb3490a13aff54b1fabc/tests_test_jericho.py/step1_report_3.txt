{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be a standard Python package or script, possibly for data processing or utility functions, but the specific purpose cannot be conclusively determined due to the lack of contextual information.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include environment variables, potentially external files or network sources if present, but none are explicitly visible in the provided code snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, network connections, or data output functions, but none are explicitly identified in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "No clear source-to-sink data flows are evident due to the absence of detailed code; the analysis is limited to the provided fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code are detected within this code snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code appears straightforward with no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data leakage, or insecure practices. Usage of third-party libraries seems standard. No backdoors, data exfiltration, or cryptic constructs are visible. The structure and content suggest typical Python code without obfuscation or malicious intent. The lack of concrete data sources or sinks limits the depth of analysis but no immediate security concerns are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code appears benign with no anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.",
