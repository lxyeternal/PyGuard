  "conclusion": "The script is primarily a build setup with some practices that could be exploited if the environment is compromised. No malicious activity or malware is detected. The obfuscation is minimal and likely intended to obscure variable names rather than conceal malicious code. Overall, the code is not malicious but warrants cautious handling due to its dynamic execution and build process."
