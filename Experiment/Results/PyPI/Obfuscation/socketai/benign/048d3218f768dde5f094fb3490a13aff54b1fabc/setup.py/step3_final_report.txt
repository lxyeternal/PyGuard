  "purpose": "Build and setup process for the Python package, including compilation of native code, verification of required libraries, and configuration of package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'version.py' via exec, checking for the existence of shared library files, reading 'requirements.txt', and environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'make' commands via subprocess, dynamic execution of 'version.py' with exec().",
  "flows": "Source: reading 'version.py' -> Sink: exec() execution; Source: subprocess.check_call() -> Sink: system build process; Source: file existence check -> Sink: potential error handling.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'exec' on external file 'version.py', obfuscated variable names, execution of 'make' commands without validation, redundant imports of setup(), unusual parameter name in setup().",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard build and setup tasks with some risky practices such as executing external build commands and dynamically executing code from 'version.py'. Variable obfuscation and redundant imports are suspicious but not malicious. No network activity or malicious payloads are present. The use of 'exec' and unvalidated subprocess calls pose moderate security risks, but there is no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The script is primarily a build setup with some practices that could be exploited if the environment is compromised. No malicious activity or malware is detected. The obfuscation is minimal and likely intended to obscure variable names rather than conceal malicious code. Overall, the code is not malicious but warrants cautious handling due to its dynamic execution and build process.",
