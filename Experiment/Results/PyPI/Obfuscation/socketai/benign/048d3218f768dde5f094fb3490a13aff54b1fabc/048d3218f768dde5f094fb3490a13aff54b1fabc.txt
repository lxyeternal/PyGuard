      "conclusion": "The script is primarily a build setup with some practices that could be exploited if the environment is compromised. No malicious activity or malware is detected. The obfuscation is minimal and likely intended to obscure variable names rather than conceal malicious code. Overall, the code is not malicious but warrants cautious handling due to its dynamic execution and build process."

      "conclusion": "The code appears as a specialized interface with obfuscation and dynamic library handling, but no evidence of malicious payloads or sabotage. The primary concern is the integrity of the shared library and the obfuscation techniques used. Further validation of the shared library source and checksum verification is recommended."

      "conclusion": "The dependency shows no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to potential unvalidated input handling, but no active threats are identified. The malware score is zero, and the obfuscation score is zero, with a low to moderate security risk score (around 0.2-0.3) justified by the potential for input validation issues. Overall, the dependency appears safe based on current evidence."

      "conclusion": "The code is primarily documentation and utility functions with some placeholder or obfuscation artifacts confined to comments. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The current malware score of 0 and low obfuscation and risk scores are justified. Minor adjustments to obfuscation scores could be considered, but overall, the code is safe."

      "conclusion": "The dependency shows minimal malicious activity overall, with one report indicating potential malicious behavior due to obfuscation and dynamic code execution. The scores are justified and consistent with the analysis, suggesting low to moderate security risks. No immediate threats are identified, but caution is advised if further code details reveal more suspicious patterns."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits varying degrees of suspicion, with some reports indicating benign behavior and others showing significant malicious indicators. The overall threat level is moderate to high, primarily driven by reports with network activity, hardcoded secrets, and dynamic code execution. The scoring system is consistent with these observations, with minor adjustments to better align the scores with the described behaviors."

      "conclusion": "The provided reports' scores are consistent with their content and reasoning. No further adjustments are needed; suspicion in report 5 is justified but does not confirm malicious intent. Overall, the dependency appears low risk with some obfuscation concerns in specific modules."
