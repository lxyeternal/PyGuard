  "purpose": "Defines a template-based action with associated identifiers for generating text actions.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'action', 'template_id', 'obj_ids'.",
  "sinks": "No evident data sinks that could lead to data leakage or malicious behavior.",
  "flows": "Parameters are used to generate a descriptive action, with no apparent flow to external systems or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a descriptive docstring or comment rather than executable code. No code constructs, such as dynamic execution, data processing, or network operations, are present. The repeated use of 'KGoxDopvYgQsHfscpLfqiMxWHFQGRUqT' suggests placeholder or obfuscated text, but within a comment, this is benign.",
  "analysis": "The provided snippet is a comment or documentation describing a class 'TemplateAction' and its parameters. There are no executable statements, no data processing, and no external interactions. The repetitive text 'KGoxDopvYgQsHfscpLfqiMxWHFQGRUqT' seems to be placeholder or obfuscated text, but it does not impact security as it's within a comment. No code injection, malicious behavior, or suspicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is purely descriptive documentation without executable code or malicious intent. No security concerns are identified based on this content.",
