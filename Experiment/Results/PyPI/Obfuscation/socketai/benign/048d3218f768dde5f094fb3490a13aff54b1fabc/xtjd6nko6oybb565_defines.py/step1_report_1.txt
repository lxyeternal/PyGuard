  "purpose": "Define a class or data structure representing a template-based action with associated metadata.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: action (string), template_id (int), obj_ids (list). No external data sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are explicitly shown; no untrusted data handling or output functions are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters to class attributes or internal variables; no external or untrusted data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The description contains repeated strings like 'KGoxDopvYgQsHfscpLfqiMxWHFQGRUqT', which appear as placeholders or obfuscated text but are part of descriptive comments. No actual code implementing logic or execution flow is provided.",
  "analysis": "The provided snippet appears to be a descriptive comment or docstring outlining the purpose of a class or data structure. It mentions parameters with their types and explanations. There is no executable code, no data processing, no external data handling, and no suspicious operations. The repeated sequences seem to be obfuscated or placeholder text, but they are not code. Without executable code, there are no potential security issues, malicious behaviors, or malicious code patterns evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is merely a descriptive comment or documentation fragment outlining a data structure for a template action. There is no executable code, no data flows, and no suspicious or malicious content. Therefore, there are no security concerns or malware detected.",
