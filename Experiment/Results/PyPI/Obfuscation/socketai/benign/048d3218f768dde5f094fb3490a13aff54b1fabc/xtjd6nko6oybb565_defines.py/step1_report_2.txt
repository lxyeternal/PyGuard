{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class description for TemplateAction, which models an action with associated template and object IDs.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources; only parameter definitions within the class description.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data is being processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only documents data structures.",
  "anomalies": "The repeated 'KGoxDopvYgQsHfscpLfqiMxWHFQGRUqT' strings appear to be placeholders or obfuscated tokens but are part of comments/descriptions, not executable code.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is purely a descriptive comment block outlining the purpose of a class named TemplateAction with parameters: action (string), template_id (int), and obj_ids (list). There is no actual implementation, executable code, or logic present. The repeated string pattern appears in comments and does not indicate obfuscation or malicious intent. Overall, the code is standard documentation without executable or suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple class documentation describing parameters for a template action. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It appears to be benign descriptive comments only.",
