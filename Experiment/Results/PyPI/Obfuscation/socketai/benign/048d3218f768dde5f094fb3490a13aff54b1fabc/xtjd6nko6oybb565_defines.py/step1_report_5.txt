{
  "purpose": "Define a class for a templated action that contains an action string, a template ID, and object IDs used to generate the action.",
  "sources": "The code reads the parameters 'action', 'template_id', and 'obj_ids' which are likely provided by external input or API calls when instantiating the class.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks in this code snippet; no data is being processed or transmitted externally.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are stored as class attributes but do not flow into any insecure operations or external systems within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious operations, are present. The code appears straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code describes a class that bundles an action with associated template and object IDs. It only contains parameter definitions and documentation comments. There are no operations, data processing, or external calls present that could introduce security risks. Since it’s a data structure definition, it inherently poses minimal security concern. No malicious behavior or security issues are detectable within this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a simple class definition serving as a data container for templated actions. It contains no malicious logic, no suspicious data flows, and no security vulnerabilities. It appears safe and standard.",
