{
  "purpose": "Wrapper for a Z-machine interpreter, manages game states, loads shared libraries, uses obfuscated variable names.",
  "sources": "Reads game files, hashes them, loads shared libraries from temp directories.",
  "sinks": "Calls into external shared libraries via ctypes; potential for malicious code if library compromised.",
  "flows": "Data flows from files into hashes, then into dynamic library loading, then into ctypes calls.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation, dynamic library copied into temp directories, minimal comments, non-descriptive names.",
  "analysis": "Functions as a wrapper for a native game engine; obfuscation and dynamic library handling could be for concealment but are also common in obfuscated or protected code. No clear malicious activity detected. The code's reliance on external shared libraries ('libfrotz.so') means security depends on their integrity. Obfuscation and dynamic loading are suspicious but not definitive of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears as a specialized interface with obfuscation and dynamic library handling, but no evidence of malicious payloads or sabotage. The primary concern is the integrity of the shared library and the obfuscation techniques used. Further validation of the shared library source and checksum verification is recommended.",
