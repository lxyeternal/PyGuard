  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly provided in the snippet; further context is needed to determine its intended functionality.",
  "sources": "The code reads input or data primarily from environment variables and possibly from external modules or files (if present in the full code). Specific source points are not visible in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include functions or modules that perform network requests, execute system commands, write to files, or handle sensitive data. No explicit sinks are visible in the given snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flow from sources (such as environment variables or inputs) to sinks (like network calls or system commands) cannot be confirmed without additional code context. The current snippet does not show these flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are apparent in the provided snippet. The code appears straightforward and adheres to standard Python practices.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet is minimal and does not contain any obvious source, sink, or flow indicative of malicious activity. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated logic, or suspicious constructs are present. Without additional context or code segments, it appears to be benign. However, the lack of detailed content limits the certainty of this assessment.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems to be standard, non-malicious Python code, but a comprehensive review of the entire package is recommended to ensure safety.",
