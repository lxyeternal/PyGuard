  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility function, but the exact intent cannot be determined due to lack of context or specific functionality.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from standard input, environment variables, or possibly external files (if present). No explicit external data sources or network calls are visible.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include writing to files, printing to console, or network communication if such code exists elsewhere. No explicit sinks are evident in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources or environment variables to internal processing functions, but without specific code details, precise flow paths cannot be established.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code structures, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code are detected. No malicious code patterns or backdoors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code fragment is either incomplete or consists of standard, benign Python functions and imports. It does not contain any obfuscated or suspicious constructs. Without more context or code, no malicious behavior is apparent. The code does not show signs of data exfiltration, malicious backdoors, or insecure operations.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears benign, with no suspicious activities or anomalies. Confidence is high that this code is safe.",
