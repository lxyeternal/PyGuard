  "conclusion": "The code is primarily documentation and utility functions with some placeholder or obfuscation artifacts confined to comments. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The current malware score of 0 and low obfuscation and risk scores are justified. Minor adjustments to obfuscation scores could be considered, but overall, the code is safe."
