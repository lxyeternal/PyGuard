  "purpose": "The purpose of this code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to perform some form of data processing or communication, possibly involving external resources.",
  "sources": "Input data from user input, environment variables, or network sources. Specific source code not provided, so unable to identify exact sources.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive functions such as network communication, file writing, or executing system commands. Exact sinks cannot be determined without code details.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks possibly through processing functions or data manipulation, but specific flow paths cannot be determined without code.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies detected due to lack of visible code; need the actual code to identify hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "Due to the absence of the actual code content, a detailed step-by-step analysis cannot be performed. However, typical review involves examining input points, data handling, and output points for suspicious activity. Without code, cannot assess for malicious behaviors such as secret exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful payloads.",
  "conclusion": "Insufficient information to definitively assess the code for malicious behavior. No clear malicious patterns or anomalies can be identified without the actual code snippet. The overall security risk cannot be reliably evaluated.",
