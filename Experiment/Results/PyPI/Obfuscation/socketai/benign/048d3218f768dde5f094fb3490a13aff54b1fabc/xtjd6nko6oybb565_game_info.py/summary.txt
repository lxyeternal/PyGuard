  "conclusion": "The dependency shows no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to potential unvalidated input handling, but no active threats are identified. The malware score is zero, and the obfuscation score is zero, with a low to moderate security risk score (around 0.2-0.3) justified by the potential for input validation issues. Overall, the dependency appears safe based on current evidence."
