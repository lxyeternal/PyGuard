  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Standard input/output, environment variables, database connections, network requests, file operations, user inputs.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, data transmission, system commands.",
  "flows": "Sources to sinks via function calls, data processing routines, network modules, environment reads.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious external connections, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious payloads detected.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets are either absent or described as standard, benign Python code with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0) are consistent with the descriptions. The security risk scores of 0.2 are slightly conservative but acceptable; they could be lowered to 0.1 given the lack of suspicious indicators. Confidence levels are high, reflecting the thoroughness of the assessments based on available descriptions.",
  "conclusion": "All reports accurately conclude the absence of malicious or suspicious code. The scoring is appropriate, though risk scores could be marginally reduced to reflect the benign nature. Overall, the dependency appears safe for use.",
