  "purpose": "The code appears to initialize a web server and perform some form of data processing or handling, possibly related to API requests.",
  "sources": "Input data from incoming HTTP requests, environment variables, or configuration files.",
  "sinks": "Output responses to HTTP clients, logging functions, or database operations.",
  "flows": "Input data received via HTTP request -> processed by internal functions -> output or stored in database.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials or secrets. No evidence of obfuscated or overly complex code. No suspicious external connections or commands.",
  "analysis": "The code structure involves setting up a server, handling incoming requests, and processing data. It uses common Python libraries and follows typical patterns for web services. No malicious or maliciously obfuscated code detected. There are no signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads. External library use is standard and justified by the context. Overall, the code appears to serve a legitimate function with no indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a standard web server implementation without suspicious elements.",
