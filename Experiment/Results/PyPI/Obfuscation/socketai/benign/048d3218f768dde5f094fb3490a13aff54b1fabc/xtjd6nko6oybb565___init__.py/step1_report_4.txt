  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be a Python module that might involve data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "Potential input sources include environment variables, user inputs, or external data files (not explicitly shown in the code snippet).",
  "sinks": "Possible sinks include network connections, file writes, or system calls (not explicitly visible in the provided code).",
  "flows": "Data flow paths are unclear without more context; likely involve reading input and processing or transmitting data internally.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic were observed in the provided snippet. The code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be standard Python without obfuscation or suspicious constructs. There are no signs of malicious code such as network connections to suspicious domains, data exfiltration, or backdoors. Usage of third-party libraries is not inherently malicious. Lack of explicit input/output handling limits detailed flow analysis, but nothing suspicious is visible.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign and does not demonstrate any signs of malware, supply chain attacks, or security issues.",
