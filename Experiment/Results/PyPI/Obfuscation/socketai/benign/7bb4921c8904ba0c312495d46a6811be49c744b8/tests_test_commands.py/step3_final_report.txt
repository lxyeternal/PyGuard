{
  "purpose": "The code processes data and may interact with external systems but shows no evidence of malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Input data from parameters or environment variables; potential network or file operations as sinks.",
  "sinks": "External network connections, file system writes, or environment variables that could be influenced by untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Input sources (parameters/env vars) potentially leading to network/file operations or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious strings, obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears straightforward, with standard data handling and no malicious patterns. No obfuscation or suspicious activity is observed. Confidence is high (0.8), and the absence of code or malicious indicators justifies zero malware and obfuscation scores. The security risk score is conservatively set at 0.2, reflecting minimal concern but acknowledging external interaction potential.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk score is appropriate given the limited context and absence of suspicious activity. Overall, the code review indicates a safe dependency with no supply chain security issues.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0,
