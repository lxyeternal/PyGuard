{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, configuring dependencies, metadata, and test commands.",
  "sources": "Reads from '__init__.py' file to extract version info, and from setup arguments for dependencies and package data.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks for untrusted data or inputs; setup configurations are static.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from package files during setup; no untrusted data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function names and variable names, which seem intentionally obscure, possibly to hide intent. The function wyvOwmmXrilgqMKZzklHaFuZoGpneCao reads and extracts version info, but the use of such naming patterns is unusual and potentially suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard package setup with unusual naming to obfuscate function and variable names, likely to evade detection. It reads version info from a package file and configures dependencies and test commands. No dynamic code execution, no network activity, or data leaks are observed. The obfuscation and unconventional naming raise suspicion but do not directly indicate malicious behavior. The code appears to be a typical but intentionally obscured setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated setup script that appears to serve the purpose of configuring a Python package. No direct malicious activity or malware is evident, but the obfuscation could be used to hide malicious intent. Overall, the script itself does not contain malware or security risks, but caution is advised due to its obfuscated nature.",
