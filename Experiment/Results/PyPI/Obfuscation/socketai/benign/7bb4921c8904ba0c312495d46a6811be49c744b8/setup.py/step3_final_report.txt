  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, handling version extraction, dependencies, and test configuration.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from 'pypiuploader/__init__.py' via obfuscated function; importing dependencies; reading 'LICENSE' file.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Version info source flows into setup configuration; dependencies and test commands are configured but do not process untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with nonsensical variable and function names; use of invalid attribute 'os.TCzqfqHfCzaIPBTGoGWVxbUyRXjuIeSc' which does not exist in the 'os' module; unused imports ('requests', 'pip>=8').",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated identifiers. The invalid attribute access indicates obfuscation or tampering, potentially malicious. No network activity, data exfiltration, or code execution from untrusted sources is evident. The obfuscation and invalid attribute usage are red flags, suggesting possible sabotage or malicious intent. The malware score remains low (0.3) due to lack of active malicious behavior, but the obfuscation and anomalies increase the security concern. Further static or dynamic analysis is recommended to verify intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a heavily obfuscated setup script with suspicious attribute references that do not exist in the standard library, indicating potential malicious tampering or sabotage. No active malware or malicious activity is observed, but the obfuscation and anomalies warrant caution and further investigation.",
