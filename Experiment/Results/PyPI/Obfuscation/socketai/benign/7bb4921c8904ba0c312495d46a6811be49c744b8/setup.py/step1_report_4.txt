{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for a Python package, defining package metadata, dependencies, and test commands.",
  "sources": "File reading operations (wTYLsvpKzurMECiGWrbqzbBrEUibXtDQ function), package setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that process untrusted external input; package metadata and dependencies are static.",
  "flows": "N/A — static configuration; no untrusted data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of heavily obfuscated function and variable names, including a function that constructs a file path and reads its contents. The code uses unconventional naming and dynamic reading of version info, but no malicious patterns such as code execution, network calls, or credential handling are present.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be an intentionally obfuscated setup script with functions to read a version string from a package file. No evidence of malicious behavior like network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The obfuscation might be an attempt to hide malicious intent, but the actual code is limited to standard setup procedures. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious external calls, or unsafe practices are evident. The function names and variable names are deliberately obscure but serve the purpose of extracting version info and configuring package data.",
  "conclusion": "The script functions as a typical setup configuration with obfuscated variable names but does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It is likely benign, serving to configure package installation and testing.",
