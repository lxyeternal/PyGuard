  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code indicators such as dynamic execution, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, and network activity.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, external sources, input functions, environment variables, files, network sockets, subprocess calls.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, subprocesses, file writes, system calls, data storage, external systems.",
  "flows": "Data from sources (inputs, environment variables) to sinks (network, system commands, files), often unvalidated or obfuscated.",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic code execution (`exec`/`eval`), hardcoded URLs/IPs, obfuscated variable names, suspicious libraries, unvalidated data flows, empty or placeholder code.",
  "analysis": "The reports identify patterns such as dynamic execution, network activity, obfuscation, and hardcoded secrets as suspicious indicators. Reports 1, 3, and 5 show multiple signs of malicious intent, with high obfuscation and malware suspicion scores justified by these indicators. Reports 2 and 4 are benign, with no suspicious activity. The scores across reports are consistent with their descriptions, with higher suspicion in reports 1, 3, and 5. The overall assessment estimates a malware score around 0.65, obfuscation around 0.75, and security risk around 0.75, reflecting the evidence of malicious patterns in some reports and benign nature in others.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed reports' scores are justified based on their described suspicious behaviors, such as dynamic code execution, obfuscation, and network activity. No significant inconsistencies are observed. The overall threat level is moderate to high in some reports, warranting further static and dynamic analysis, especially for reports 1, 3, and 5. The benign reports are correctly scored as low risk. The scores are appropriate and reflect the evidence presented.",
