{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple Python script that performs basic operations such as printing a message and possibly handling some data or configuration.",
  "sources": "Data sources are limited; primarily the script reads no external input or data. If any environment variables or command-line arguments are used, they are not visible in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "Output functions like print() are used, which are benign in this context. No suspicious network connections, file modifications, or system commands are apparent.",
  "flows": "Since the code is straightforward, there are no complex source-to-sink data flows. It does not process or transmit untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs are observed. The code structure is simple and typical.",
  "analysis": "The code performs basic operations without any external data input, network communication, or system modifications. It does not contain obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or hidden behaviors. No anomalies suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is benign and appears to serve a simple purpose.",
