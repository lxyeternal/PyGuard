  "purpose": "Analyze open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Input data read via functions like open(), network requests, environment variables, or user input.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, system commands, or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources feeding into sinks directly or through data processing, especially if untrusted data reaches sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, dynamic execution (eval/exec), unusual control flow, or suspicious imports.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward with no obfuscation or malicious patterns. No suspicious data flows or hardcoded secrets are evident. Dynamic execution is absent, and third-party libraries appear benign. The code's purpose aligns with standard data processing or utility functions, with no signs of sabotage or privacy violations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no malicious intent or security risks. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the overall security risk is minimal. Confidence in this assessment is high.",
