  "flows": "Input or environment data is processed and then potentially transmitted over the network or stored locally.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. No unusual system commands or data exfiltration mechanisms identified.",
  "analysis": "The script processes input and environment data in a typical manner, uses standard libraries, and writes logs or performs network requests that appear benign. No suspicious dynamic code execution, malicious data handling, or data leakage observed. The structure and formatting are consistent with normal application code. No signs of malware or obfuscation present.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided content. It appears to be standard application code with no supply chain threats identified.",
