  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple script for demonstrating basic functionality, possibly for educational purposes or as a utility tool.",
  "sources": "Reads data from standard input, environment variables, and possibly external files or network sources (if present).",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to standard output, writes to files, or sends data over network connections.",
  "flows": "Input sources feed into processing functions; data may be sent to output or external services without validation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed. No obfuscated code or unusual language features detected.",
  "analysis": "The code structure is straightforward with typical input/output operations. No signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, system compromise, or covert channels. Usage of third-party libraries appears benign. No dynamic code execution, hidden backdoors, or suspicious network activity are evident. Overall, the code seems clean, with no malicious patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign and intended for standard functionality.",
