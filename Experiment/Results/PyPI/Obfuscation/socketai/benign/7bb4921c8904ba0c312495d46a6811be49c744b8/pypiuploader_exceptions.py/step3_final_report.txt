  "purpose": "The code handles HTTP 409 conflict responses during package uploads to PyPI by raising an exception, serving as standard error handling logic.",
  "sources": "The server response indicating HTTP 409, the exception handling block that raises 'PackageUploader' exception.",
  "sinks": "The exception raising point, which could potentially affect the upload process or trigger error handling routines.",
  "flows": "Server responds with HTTP 409 -> Exception is raised in the code -> Error handling or user notification occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code performs typical conflict handling. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The scenario described involves standard error handling for a common HTTP conflict during package upload. No malicious or suspicious code is indicated; the logic is straightforward. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1) are appropriate given the benign nature of the handling. No evidence suggests malicious intent or obfuscation. The minimal security risk reflects routine conflict management, not a vulnerability.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard conflict handling during package uploads. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores are accurate and do not require adjustment.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
