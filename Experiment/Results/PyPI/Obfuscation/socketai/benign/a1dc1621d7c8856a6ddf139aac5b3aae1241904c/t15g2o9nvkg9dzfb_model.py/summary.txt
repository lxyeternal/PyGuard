  "conclusion": "The code is a typical ORM-like data model with no malicious intent or malware detected. The main security concern is the non-cryptographic ID generator, which could be exploited but does not constitute malicious behavior. The code shows no signs of supply chain attack, obfuscation, or sabotage."
