  "purpose": "Analysis of obfuscated import statements and variable assignments in a Python module, with no evident malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Relative imports from sibling modules (.model, .main), assignment of version string to a variable.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data flows, network, or file operations present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; code does not process untrusted input or perform data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class/function names, which could be auto-generated or intentionally concealed, but not necessarily malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports components with obfuscated names, assigns a version string, and defines __all__. No suspicious data flows, network activity, or environment variable usage are visible. The obfuscation may be for code protection or auto-generation, not malicious intent. The absence of malicious behavior, combined with the lack of suspicious code patterns, supports a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, obfuscated module with no malicious intent. The obfuscation level is moderate, but it does not indicate malicious activity. The malware score remains 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2). The obfuscation score is appropriate at approximately 0.7, reflecting the obfuscated identifiers. Overall, the code is benign based on the provided snippet.",
