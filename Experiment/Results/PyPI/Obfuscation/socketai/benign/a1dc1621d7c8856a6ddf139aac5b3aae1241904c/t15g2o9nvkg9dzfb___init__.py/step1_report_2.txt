{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a Python package, likely importing specific modules and defining public API variables.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.model and .main), variable assignment to HQpnindRQOMQicmSxXSeaNhTSFhqDmkK",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks such as network calls, file writes, or system commands; variable assignments are simple and local",
  "flows": "Imported modules are loaded, and a string is assigned to a variable, but no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks",
  "anomalies": "The imported names and variables appear obfuscated or auto-generated, which can sometimes be suspicious, but no malicious patterns are present",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes/functions from local modules, assigns a string to a variable, and defines an API tuple. There are no indications of data leakage, code injection, or malicious behavior. The obfuscated names could be due to code obfuscation or auto-generation but do not inherently imply malicious intent. No external network, file, or environment interactions are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a straightforward module setup with obfuscated identifiers, possibly due to code generation or obfuscation, but no malicious activities are evident.",

  "obfuscated": 0.8,
