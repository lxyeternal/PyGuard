{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a Python package module, importing specific classes or functions from other modules and defining a version string and exported symbols.",
  "sources": "Imports from .model and .main modules",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data are present",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; only static assignments and imports",
  "anomalies": "Presence of non-descriptive, seemingly random class/function names (e.g., WQoZXMoovPdiOunWKigFLhoyOGnafffX, FNHKMQNJwdEKaVEzdaHTrudBvznrNGeM) which may suggest obfuscation or code concealment. The version string is a float stored as a string, which is normal but could be a placeholder. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting of import statements, a version string, and an __all__ declaration. The import statements suggest the module depends on other parts of the package. The random-looking class names could be a sign of obfuscation but are not inherently malicious. No data flows from untrusted sources, no suspicious functions or behaviors are evident. The structure appears typical of an internal module with obfuscated identifiers but no malicious indicators identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks based on its content. The unusual class/function names may indicate obfuscation but do not imply malicious intent. No evidence of malware or security vulnerabilities detected.",
