{
  "purpose": "The code provides data validation and sanitization for input data, using Pydantic models and custom error handling, to ensure data conforms to specified schemas before processing.",
  "sources": "Data is read from the 'data' parameter in the 'wrapper' function, which is passed to the '_strip' and '_check' functions for validation and sanitization.",
  "sinks": "The data flows into Pydantic model validation ('filters') and may raise exceptions ('ErrorType', 'ErrorSpecified') if validation fails. These exceptions are meant for error handling, not malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Input data is sanitized by '_strip' to trim strings, then validated by '_check' via Pydantic models; validation errors are caught and converted into custom exceptions, which are raised if validation fails.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are present. Usage of Pydantic and custom error classes is standard for validation logic. No obfuscated code, malicious network calls, or file system modifications are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data sanitization and validation routines using well-known libraries and techniques. It handles validation errors and raises custom exceptions accordingly. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident; the code appears to be a typical validation middleware. The functions are straightforward and do not execute any external commands or access sensitive data beyond input validation. No anomalies or malware-like behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a typical validation utility for Python web applications or APIs. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code is well-structured, uses standard libraries, and performs input sanitization and validation securely.",
