{
  "purpose": "Provides data sanitization and validation using Pydantic models, with error handling via custom exceptions.",
  "sources": "Input data passed to the decorated function after being sanitized and validated.",
  "sinks": "Validation errors raised as exceptions; no external sinks or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input through _strip (sanitization), then _check (validation), and finally to the wrapped function if valid.",
  "anomalies": "Recursive _strip could cause performance issues with deeply nested malicious data, but not malicious code itself.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data sanitization and validation routines without external calls or obfuscation. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The recursive _strip function, while potentially exploitable for DoS, does not constitute malicious activity. Error handling uses well-known libraries and custom exceptions, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the code's straightforward nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical validation utility with no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The potential performance concern with _strip is not indicative of malicious behavior. Overall, the component appears safe and well-structured.",
