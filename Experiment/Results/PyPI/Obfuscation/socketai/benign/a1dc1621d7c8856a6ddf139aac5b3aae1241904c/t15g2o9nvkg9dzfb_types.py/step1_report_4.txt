{
  "purpose": "Provides data validation utilities using Pydantic and custom error handling, intended to sanitize and validate incoming data.",
  "sources": "Input data received via the 'data' parameter in the 'wrapper' function.",
  "targets": "The '_check' function which calls Pydantic filters, potentially handling untrusted data; errors raised are custom but don't inherently lead to harm.",
  "flows": "Data is stripped of whitespace in '_strip', then validated through '_check'. If validation fails, errors are raised. Data flows from input to validation to potential error handling.",
  "anomalies": "Use of recursive '_strip' which could cause excessive recursion if data contains deeply nested structures. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs data sanitization and validation using standard libraries (functools, pydantic) and custom error classes. No signs of obfuscation or malicious code. The '_strip' function recursively cleans data, which could be inefficient with maliciously crafted deeply nested data but does not execute code or access external resources. The validation logic leverages Pydantic, which is standard and secure if filters are properly defined. Error handling raises custom exceptions, but nothing indicates malicious intent or harmful side effects. No network operations, file modifications, or credential handling observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured data validation utility with no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The use of recursive '_strip' could pose performance issues with maliciously crafted input, but it does not constitute malicious code per se. Overall, the code is safe but should be reviewed for filter definitions and data handling in the broader application context.",
