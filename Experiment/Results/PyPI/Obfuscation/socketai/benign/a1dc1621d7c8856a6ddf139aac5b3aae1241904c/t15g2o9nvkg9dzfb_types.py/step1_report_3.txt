{
  "purpose": "Provides validation utilities for data structures using pydantic, including stripping whitespace and error handling.",
  "sources": "The function _strip reads data from the 'data' parameter; the function _check reads 'data' for validation; the decorator 'validate' reads 'data' after stripping.",
  "sinks": "Potential validation errors raised by _check and _strip could influence control flow; no external sinks or data exfiltration points are evident.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from 'data' into _strip, then into _check, and finally into the wrapped function 'f'. No external or network operations are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. Usage of pydantic for validation is standard. The code does not perform any dangerous actions such as file access, network communication, or executing external code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines helper functions for sanitizing and validating data. _strip recursively trims whitespace from strings within data structures. _check attempts to validate data with a given pydantic model, raising custom errors on failure. The validate decorator applies these functions before calling the actual function. No obfuscated code, malicious injections, or suspicious behaviors are present. The overall code appears to be a straightforward validation utility, with proper error handling and no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard validation utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is designed solely for data validation and error management, with no external communications or harmful actions.",
