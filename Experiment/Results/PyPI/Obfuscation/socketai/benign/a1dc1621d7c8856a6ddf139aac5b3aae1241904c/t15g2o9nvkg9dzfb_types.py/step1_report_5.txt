{
  "purpose": "This code provides a data validation utility that strips whitespace from input data and validates it against a specified schema using Pydantic models.",
  "sources": "Data is read from the 'data' argument in the wrapper function, which is passed to '_strip' and '_check' functions.",
  "sinks": "Validation occurs via Pydantic models, which can process untrusted data, but no external data sinks (e.g., network, files) are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'data' argument, through '_strip' for sanitization, then '_check' for validation, and finally into the decorated function.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code behaviors are evident. No hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or backdoors are present. The validation logic is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for data sanitization ('_strip') and validation ('_check') using Pydantic models. The 'validate' decorator applies these functions before invoking the wrapped function. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code operates solely within the process, handling input validation. No obfuscated code, malicious injections, or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This module implements standard input sanitization and validation routines without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It appears safe and intended solely for data validation purposes.",
