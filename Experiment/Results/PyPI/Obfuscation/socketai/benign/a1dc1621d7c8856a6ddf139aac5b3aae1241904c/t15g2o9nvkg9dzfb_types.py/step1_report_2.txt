{
  "purpose": "This code provides a data validation utility using Pydantic models, with functions to strip whitespace and validate data structures before passing them to other functions.",
  "sources": "The data source is the 'data' argument passed to the 'wrapper' function, which is processed by _strip and _check.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the _check function where validation errors are raised, but no dangerous system or network calls are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'data' argument into _strip for sanitization, then into _check for validation, and finally to the wrapped function if valid.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs are detected. The code follows standard validation patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Python libraries and practices for data validation. _strip recursively cleans input data. _check uses Pydantic for validation and raises custom errors. The validate decorator applies these functions before calling the target function. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or file manipulations are present. The code appears secure and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements common data validation logic without suspicious or malicious elements. There are no indications of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent. The security risk is low.",
