{
  "purpose": "Define multiple custom exception classes inheriting from a base exception class with no additional functionality, mainly assigning a class variable.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and class variable assignments.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or data flows to untrusted data sources; no input/output operations or network activity.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; classes are only defined with class variables.",
  "anomalies": "Class names and variable names are obfuscated with random strings, no meaningful identifiers. No actual executable or malicious logic present. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions, all inheriting from a custom exception class. The base class defines a class variable and an __init__ method that stores an argument. Subclasses only override the class variable with different integer values, but do not add any additional behavior or data. The naming appears intentionally obfuscated, but there is no functional or malicious code present. No data input, external calls, or harmful logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be obfuscated but functionally benign. It defines custom exception classes with no operational behavior or malicious intent. There are no signs of malware, data exfiltration, or supply chain attacks.",
