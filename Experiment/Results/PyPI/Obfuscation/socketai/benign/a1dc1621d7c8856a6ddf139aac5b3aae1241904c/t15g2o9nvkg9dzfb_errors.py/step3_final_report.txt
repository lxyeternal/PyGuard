{
  "purpose": "The code defines multiple subclasses of a custom exception class, each with a class variable set to an integer, using obfuscated class and variable names. It appears to serve as placeholder or structural code without active logic.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and class variables; no input, data reading, or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or system effects; no external interactions or data processing.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static class declarations without dynamic execution or data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with nonsensical class and variable names; absence of executable logic; only static class variables with incremental integers.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions with obfuscated names and static class variables. There is no runtime behavior, data processing, network activity, or external interactions. The obfuscation may be intended to conceal the code's purpose but does not indicate malicious intent. The malware scores are minimal or zero, aligning with the lack of malicious activity. The obfuscation scores are high due to the nonsensical naming, which is justified. The overall security risk is very low, given the absence of active behavior or external effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is obfuscated placeholder or structural class definitions with no malicious or active security threat. The high obfuscation level warrants caution but does not constitute malicious behavior. The low malware and risk scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
