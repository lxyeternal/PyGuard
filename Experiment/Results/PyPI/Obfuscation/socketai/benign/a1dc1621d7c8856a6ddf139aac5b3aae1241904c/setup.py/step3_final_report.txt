  "purpose": "A setup script for a Python package that reads README.md, extracts version info from consys/__init__.py, and calls setup() with package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md, reading consys/__init__.py for version info",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows present",
  "flows": "File reads for README.md and version extraction, then data passed to setup()",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names, which are unusual but not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard package setup script with obfuscated variable names. It performs file reads and regex extraction of version info without network activity, code injection, or external data processing. No hardcoded credentials or malicious commands are present. Obfuscation raises suspicion but does not indicate malicious intent. All indicators point to a benign setup process.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with obfuscation but no malicious or security-critical issues. The obfuscation alone does not imply malicious intent, and no evidence of malware or vulnerabilities is present. Scores should reflect zero malware likelihood, moderate obfuscation, and low security risk.",
