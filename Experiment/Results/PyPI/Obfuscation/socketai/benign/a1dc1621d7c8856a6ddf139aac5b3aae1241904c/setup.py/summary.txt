  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with obfuscation but no malicious or security-critical issues. The obfuscation alone does not imply malicious intent, and no evidence of malware or vulnerabilities is present. Scores should reflect zero malware likelihood, moderate obfuscation, and low security risk."
