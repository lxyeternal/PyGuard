  "purpose": "Factory function creating a dynamic ORM base class with database connection.",
  "sources": "Parameters host, name, login, password passed to get_db.",
  "sinks": "get_db function potentially handling credentials or establishing connections.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into get_db; class attribute _db assigned from get_db.",
  "anomalies": "Property _name returns None; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class factory that attaches a database connection via get_db, which is called with runtime parameters. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are present. The _name property returning None is unconventional but harmless. The overall structure is typical for ORM base class creation. The security concern hinges on get_db's implementation, which is unknown; however, the code itself does not exhibit malicious behavior or obfuscation. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal security concern based on the code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low risk score is appropriate, assuming get_db handles credentials securely. No further action needed based on this snippet.",
