  "conclusion": "The code is intentionally obfuscated with dynamic version-based logic, which could be used to hide malicious behavior. However, static analysis reveals no concrete evidence of malicious activity. The high obfuscation score is justified, and the malware risk remains low. It warrants further runtime review to confirm safety, but current static assessment suggests benign intent with obfuscation techniques employed."
