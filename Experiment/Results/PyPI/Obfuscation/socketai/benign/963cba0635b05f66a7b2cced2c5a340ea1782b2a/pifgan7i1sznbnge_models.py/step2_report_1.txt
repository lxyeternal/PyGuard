  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the appropriateness of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Issue presence:** The code contains obfuscated import names (`fKTFanFUrToFJdXMzPjoMmWKYBnuOZAn`) and nonsensical variable/class names, which is suspicious. The dynamic user model based on version is potentially risky if misused, but no malicious actions are evident.\n\n- **Errors/flaws:** The report correctly notes obfuscation and the potential for malicious intent but concludes no malicious activity. The reasoning is sound.\n\n- **Scores:** \n  - Malware: 0.1 — reasonable given no direct malicious actions.\n  - Obfuscated: 0.8 — justified.\n  - Risk: 0.3 — acceptable, given the obfuscation and dynamic model referencing.\n\n**Recommendation:** Scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Similar obfuscation with nonsensical import names and dynamic model selection based on version parsing. No evident malicious activity.\n\n- **Errors/flaws:** The report correctly identifies the obfuscation and notes the low security risk.\n\n- **Scores:** \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.\n  - Obfuscated: 0.6 — justified.\n  - Risk: 0.3 — acceptable.\n\n**Recommendation:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Obfuscated import names, dynamic behavior based on version, but no clear malicious activity.\n\n- **Errors/flaws:** The analysis aligns with the code, recognizing obfuscation but no malicious intent.\n\n- **Scores:** \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.\n  - Obfuscated: 0.8 — justified.\n  - Risk: 0.2 — acceptable.\n\n**Recommendation:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Obfuscated import alias, version parsing, dynamic model, and nonsensical naming.\n\n- **Errors/flaws:** Correctly notes the suspicious import alias and obfuscation, but no explicit malicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:** \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.\n  - Obfuscated: 0.7 — justified.\n  - Risk: 0.2 — acceptable.\n\n**Recommendation:** Scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Obfuscated import alias, version-based logic, potential for malicious targeting, but no direct malicious actions.\n\n- **Errors/flaws:** The report appropriately highlights the suspicious import alias and dynamic behavior but concludes no malicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:** \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.\n  - Obfuscated: 0.8 — justified.\n  - Risk: 0.3 — acceptable.\n\n**Recommendation:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign low malware scores (mostly 0.1 or 0), as no malicious actions are evident from static analysis.\n\n- **Obfuscated scores:** High across all reports (0.6–0.8), justified due to obfuscated import names, nonsensical identifiers, and dynamic behavior.\n\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly varied but generally low (0.2–0.3), considering the obfuscation and dynamic logic but no clear malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate\n\nGiven the consistent pattern of obfuscation, dynamic model referencing, and suspicious import naming, but no concrete evidence of malicious actions, I would assign:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0.1** — still low, as no direct malicious activity is demonstrated.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0.75** — high due to obfuscation techniques.\n- **Risk score:** **0.25** — moderate, primarily due to obfuscation and dynamic behavior, which could be exploited.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears intentionally obfuscated, likely to hide its true purpose, but without evidence of malicious activity. It warrants further review, especially for hidden backdoors or malicious logic that might be triggered under specific conditions.",
