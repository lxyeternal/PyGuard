  "sources": "Imports from Django modules, utilities.querysets, and settings; parsing settings.VERSION.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or external effects; no data leaks or code execution points.",
  "flows": "Parsing settings.VERSION and using its result in a conditional; defining a Django model with fields referencing the parsed version.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated import names (e.g., fKTFanFUrToFJdXMzPjoMmWKYBnuOZAn) and cryptic variable names; unusual import from 'utilities.querysets'; no clear malicious intent but suspicious obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports possibly obfuscated Django model base class and fields, and a custom query set. It parses a version string from settings and uses it in a conditional to determine a model label. The model includes JSON fields, a foreign key, and a DateTimeField. The obfuscation of import names and variable names suggests possible attempt to hide intent or complexity. No data is sent externally, no unsafe SQL is present, and no code injection points are evident. The code appears to set up model logic based on versioning but does not perform any malicious activity itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is obfuscated but appears to be a legitimate Django model definition with conditional logic based on settings version. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident from this fragment. The obfuscation may indicate an attempt to hide complexity but does not necessarily imply malicious intent.",
