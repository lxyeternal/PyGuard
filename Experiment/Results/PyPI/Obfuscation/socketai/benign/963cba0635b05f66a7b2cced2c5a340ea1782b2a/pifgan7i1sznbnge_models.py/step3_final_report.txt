  "purpose": "Analyzes a Django model with obfuscated import names and version-dependent logic to assess potential malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'django.db' with obfuscated alias, version parsing from 'packaging' library, dynamic user model selection based on version, class fields including JSONField, CharField, ForeignKey, DateTimeField.",
  "sinks": "Potentially the dynamic user model reference and version parsing could influence behavior, but no direct data leaks or malicious actions are evident.",
  "flows": "Version parsing from settings.VERSION -> conditional user model string -> ForeignKey referencing dynamic model -> class fields including JSON and CharFields.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated import alias, nonsensical variable and class names, dynamic model selection based on version, suspicious import from 'django.db' with a non-standard alias.",
  "analysis": "The code is heavily obfuscated with nonsensical import names and class identifiers, likely to hide its true purpose. It uses version parsing to determine which user model to reference, which is a common pattern but can be exploited if malicious. No network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection is visible. The obfuscation suggests an attempt to conceal intent, but static analysis shows no direct malicious actions. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent: low malware risk (0.1), high obfuscation (around 0.75), and moderate security risk (0.2-0.3). The code appears primarily obfuscated rather than malicious, but the obfuscation warrants caution and further dynamic analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is intentionally obfuscated with dynamic version-based logic, which could be used to hide malicious behavior. However, static analysis reveals no concrete evidence of malicious activity. The high obfuscation score is justified, and the malware risk remains low. It warrants further runtime review to confirm safety, but current static assessment suggests benign intent with obfuscation techniques employed.",
