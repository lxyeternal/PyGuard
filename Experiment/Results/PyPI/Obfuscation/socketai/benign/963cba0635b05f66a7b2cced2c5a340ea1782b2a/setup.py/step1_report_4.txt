{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file to include its contents as long_description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "Reads file contents into a variable, then passes static strings to setup(). No flow from untrusted input to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names do not influence functionality but suggest minimal code clarity. No hardcoded secrets or credentials. The code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup operations: determining directory path, reading a README file, and invoking setup() with metadata. Variable names are obfuscated but do not indicate malicious intent. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leakage observed. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious patterns detected. It appears as typical boilerplate setup code with obfuscated variable names.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names but no malicious intent or security issues. It does not contain malware or suspicious behaviors. Overall security risk is negligible.",
