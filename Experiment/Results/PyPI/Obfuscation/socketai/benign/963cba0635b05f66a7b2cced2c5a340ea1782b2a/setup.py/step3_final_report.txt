{
  "purpose": "This code is a standard Python setup script for packaging a project, utilizing setuptools to define package metadata and configuration.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file for long description; static parameters passed to setup() such as package name, version, download URL, license, keywords, classifiers.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Reads local README.md file and passes static data to setup() function; no dynamic or external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names used for directory path and metadata fields; superficial obfuscation with no malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with obfuscated variable names that do not affect functionality. It performs static file reading and calls setup() with predefined metadata. No external inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present. The obfuscation appears superficial, likely stylistic, and does not introduce security risks. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks are evident. The malware score is 0, as no malicious intent is detected. The obfuscation score is moderate (~0.5), reflecting superficial obfuscation. The security risk score is negligible (~0.1), consistent with the benign analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with superficial obfuscation. No malicious behavior, malware, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
