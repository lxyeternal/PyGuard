{
  "purpose": "This code is for setting up a Python package using setuptools, including reading a README file and defining package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file from the filesystem; static assignment of string literals for package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; no data leaks or external communications occur.",
  "flows": "File reading flow for README.md; static package setup configuration data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names (e.g., EsjLvQTETGxVyOqEZNjdnskVIuSPPfLE, WnQRrfDsGXIwVqxlfUfDGZHBvTHGltzS) which serve no functional purpose and obscure code intent; no user input or external data processing; no code execution or dynamic behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard setup procedures for a Python package. It reads a README.md file to include as long description, then calls setup() with metadata. Variable names are intentionally obfuscated but do not influence behavior or introduce malicious activity. No inputs from untrusted sources are processed, and no network or file manipulations beyond reading a local file occur. No suspicious or malicious code patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical package setup script with obfuscated variable names. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It appears benign and purely functional for package configuration.",
