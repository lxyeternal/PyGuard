  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup.py script for a Python package.\n- The only suspicious aspect is the obfuscated variable names, which are superficial and do not affect functionality.\n- No external inputs, network activity, dynamic code execution, or data leaks are identified.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or backdoors.\n- The code reads a local README.md file and calls setup() with static metadata.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Checks:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears syntactically correct and functional as a setup script.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious code are present.\n- **Obfuscation:** Variable names are obfuscated but used only for configuration; no malicious intent implied.\n- **Data flows:** Only reading a local file and passing static data to setup(); no untrusted data or external inputs.\n- **Security risks:** None apparent; the code is typical for a setup script.\n\n---\n\n### Issue-specific scoring review:\n\n| Report | Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score | Justification |\n|---------|-----------------|------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| 1       | 0               | 0.8              | 0            | No malware, superficial obfuscation, no security risk. |\n| 2       | 0               | 0.5              | 0            | Same reasoning; obfuscation superficial, no malicious activity. |\n| 3       | 0               | 0.2              | 0            | Same; obfuscation present but benign. |\n| 4       | 0               | 0.8              | 0.2          | Slightly higher obfuscation but no malicious activity; risk remains negligible. |\n| 5       | 0               | 0.7              | 0.1          | Similar; obfuscation, but no malicious behavior. |\n\n**Notes:**\n- The malware scores are all 0, which is consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n- Obfuscation scores are high (0.7-0.8), which is acceptable given the superficial nature.\n- Risk scores are low (0-0.2), consistent with the benign analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- **Scores adjustment:** The current scores seem reasonable given the analysis.\n- **Justification for higher scores:** Since no malicious activity is present, the malware score should remain at 0.\n- **Obfuscation:** High obfuscation is noted but not inherently malicious; it should not increase risk scores significantly.\n- **Overall security assessment:** The code is benign, standard setup code with superficial obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Final personal estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malware detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0.7** (superficial obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (negligible security risk)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe code is a typical, benign setup.py script with obfuscated variable names that do not impact security. No malicious behavior, malware, or data leaks are evident. The current report scores are consistent with this assessment.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Maintain malware score at 0, obfuscated at around 0.7, and risk at 0.1.",
