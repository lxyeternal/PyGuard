  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file from the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no untrusted data flows or data leaks identified.",
  "flows": "File read operation (source) is used solely for obtaining README content, with no data flow to other parts.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names; no clear malicious behavior. The code structure is standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools and reads a README file to include in package metadata. Variables are obfuscated but used only for configuration parameters. No external input, user data, or network activity is present. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks are evident. The script appears to be a legitimate package setup file with some obfuscation of variable names, likely for code concealment or stylistic reasons, but not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The obfuscation seems superficial and not indicative of malicious intent.",
