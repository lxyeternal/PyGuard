  "purpose": "Version-dependent plugin configuration for NetBox, with obfuscated variable and class names for obscurity.",
  "sources": "Version string from settings.VERSION, static class attributes, import statements.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; static configuration attributes only.",
  "flows": "Version parsing from settings.VERSION, conditional import based on version comparison.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and class names, superficial obfuscation with no malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a version check to determine which plugin configuration to import, then defines a configuration class with static attributes. Variable and class names are obfuscated, but the logic is straightforward and standard for plugin setup. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious code patterns are present. The obfuscation appears superficial, likely for obscurity rather than malicious intent. The version parsing and conditional import are typical, and no suspicious data flows or sinks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign plugin configuration code with superficial obfuscation. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The malware score remains 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2). The obfuscation score is justified at approximately 0.7 due to variable naming. Overall, the code is safe and aligns with the provided analysis.",
