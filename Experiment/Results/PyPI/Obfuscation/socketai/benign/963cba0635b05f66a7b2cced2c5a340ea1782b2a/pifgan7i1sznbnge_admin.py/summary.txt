  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django admin registration with highly obfuscated names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet. Obfuscation warrants caution but does not confirm malicious intent. The scores are appropriate; malware score is 0, obfuscation is high (~0.8), and overall risk is low (~0.2). Further review of the full project is recommended to determine if obfuscation is justified or malicious."
