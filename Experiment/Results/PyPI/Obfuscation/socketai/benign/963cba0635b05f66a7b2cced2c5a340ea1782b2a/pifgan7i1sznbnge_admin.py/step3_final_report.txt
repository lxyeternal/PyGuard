  "purpose": "Django admin registration for a model with obfuscated identifiers.",
  "sources": "Import statement for Django admin and the model; model and class definitions with obfuscated names; registration of model with admin class.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, network calls, or data leaks present in the code.",
  "flows": "Model definition (source) to admin registration (sink); no external data flow or malicious activity observed.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated model and class names; no apparent reason for such obfuscation in standard Django code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a typical Django admin registration with a model that has obfuscated identifiers. No malicious functions, network activity, or data exfiltration are present. The obfuscation raises suspicion but is not conclusive evidence of malicious intent. The code structure is straightforward and benign in isolation. Scores assigned in the reports are consistent: malware score 0, obfuscation high (~0.8), and low security risk (~0.2). No logical errors or security flaws are evident. Further context about the project or model definitions could clarify the purpose of obfuscation, but based solely on this fragment, the code appears safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django admin registration with highly obfuscated names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet. Obfuscation warrants caution but does not confirm malicious intent. The scores are appropriate; malware score is 0, obfuscation is high (~0.8), and overall risk is low (~0.2). Further review of the full project is recommended to determine if obfuscation is justified or malicious.",
