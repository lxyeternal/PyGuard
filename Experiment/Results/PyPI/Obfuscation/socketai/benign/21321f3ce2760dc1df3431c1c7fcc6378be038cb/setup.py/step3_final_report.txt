  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for packaging a Python module, defining metadata, modules, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Static variables defining package metadata, module list, and entry points.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static data used throughout.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; incomplete 'long_description' field missing a string value, causing a syntax error.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names, which may be stylistic or accidental. The incomplete 'long_description' is a syntax error that would prevent execution but does not indicate malicious intent. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks are present. The obfuscation is superficial and does not suggest malicious behavior. The malware score is correctly zero; obfuscation is moderate; security risk is minimal.",
  "conclusion": "The package appears benign with no malicious intent. The main issue is a syntax error due to the malformed 'long_description', which should be corrected. The obfuscation is superficial and not malicious. Overall, the code is safe, with a very low security risk.",
