{
  "purpose": "The code implements a static analysis utility for import rules, likely as a plugin for flake8, enforcing allow/deny policies based on YAML configurations.",
  "sources": "YAML rule definitions, source code lines, AST nodes during traversal, command-line options.",
  "sinks": "Modification of the 'context' dictionary to enforce import rules, raising exceptions for undefined variables.",
  "flows": "YAML rules are loaded and parsed; during AST traversal, import statements are checked against rules; violations trigger exceptions or rule enforcement logic.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated variable and class names, incomplete exception handling referencing 'line' which is undefined, complex logic that obscures intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static analysis plugin designed to enforce import rules based on YAML configurations. The obfuscation appears to be a stylistic or concealment measure rather than malicious activity. No network activity, data exfiltration, or system sabotage is evident. Exception handling is incomplete or intentionally obfuscated, but this does not indicate malicious intent. The overall structure aligns with a policy enforcement tool, with no signs of malware or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static analysis plugin for import rule enforcement with significant obfuscation but no malicious behavior. The malware score is 0, the obfuscation score is high (~0.85), and the overall security risk is low (~0.15). The obfuscation likely aims to hinder reverse engineering but does not suggest malicious intent.",
