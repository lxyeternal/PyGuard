  "conclusion": "The code is a static analysis plugin for import rule enforcement with significant obfuscation but no malicious behavior. The malware score is 0, the obfuscation score is high (~0.85), and the overall security risk is low (~0.15). The obfuscation likely aims to hinder reverse engineering but does not suggest malicious intent."
