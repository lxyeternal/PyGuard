  "purpose": "A wrapper function for token dependency clustering in text messages, utilizing filtering and computation objects.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: messages, threshold, optional token lists, symbols, and flags; internal modules: _lib_tipping, _TokenFilter, _Computation.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data or untrusted data flows to network, files, or system calls.",
  "flows": "Input messages → filtering and computation objects → internal clustering function _token_independency_clusters → output clusters and masks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names; no suspicious code, network activity, or data leaks present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard NLP clustering utility with obfuscated variable names, calling an internal clustering function with filtering options. It does not contain network calls, eval/exec, or other malicious constructs. The obfuscation appears superficial, likely for internal or stylistic reasons. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, low risk) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The obfuscation score is moderate (~0.6-0.7), reflecting the variable names, but this does not imply malicious intent. Overall, the code is a benign text processing utility with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign NLP clustering function with obfuscated variable names. No malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or suspicious data flows are present. The obfuscation is superficial and does not pose a security threat. The malware score remains at 0, and the low risk scores are justified. The obfuscation score is moderate, reflecting variable name obscurity, but does not indicate malicious intent.",
