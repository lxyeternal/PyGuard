  "purpose": "A simple pytest unit test verifying that tipping.sum_as_string(1, 1) returns '2'.",
  "sources": "The function reads no external input; it calls tipping.sum_as_string with fixed arguments.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external communication or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Input arguments (constants) flow into tipping.sum_as_string; no external or untrusted data involved.",
  "anomalies": "The function name is obfuscated and nonsensical, which could suggest obfuscation but not malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, straightforward test case with no malicious behavior. The obfuscated function name is suspicious but benign. No external data, network activity, or security vulnerabilities are present. The test simply verifies a sum operation, which is benign. The obfuscation does not imply malicious intent, and the code's purpose is clearly a unit test.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated test case with no malicious intent or security risks. The obfuscated function name does not indicate malicious activity. Overall, the code is safe, and the scores should reflect minimal security concern.",
