  "purpose": "Define metadata and constants for a Python package related to a Paginator utility.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string assignments, metadata variables",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data input/output operations, no untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; simple assignments and string formatting",
  "anomalies": "Presence of nonsensical variable names, obfuscated-like variable names, no comments or documentation, but no malicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code primarily assigns string values to variables with obscure names. The strings include package metadata such as title, version, description, URL, author, email, and license. The only notable operation is a string formatting line for copyright information. There are no functions, data handling, or external calls. The code appears to be a benign module metadata setup without any signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward metadata declaration with obfuscated variable names but no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
