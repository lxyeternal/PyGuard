  "purpose": "Metadata declarations for a Python package, including title, version, description, author, and license information.",
  "sources": "Static string assignments assigned to obfuscated variable names.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow from untrusted sources or external communication.",
  "flows": "N/A; static assignments without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names used solely for static string assignments; no dynamic code or external interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists only of static string assignments with obfuscated variable names, serving as package metadata. No dynamic code, input handling, network activity, or malicious behavior is present. The obfuscation appears superficial, likely intended to hinder readability but not to conceal malicious intent. All signals point to benign metadata declaration. No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The assigned scores in the reports (malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0.7) are justified given the superficial obfuscation and static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as static package metadata with superficial obfuscation. There is no malicious activity or security threat detected. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
