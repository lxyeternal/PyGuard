{
  "purpose": "Defines metadata and constants for a Python package related to pagination functionality.",
  "sources": "Static string assignments, predefined variables",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no data flow from untrusted sources to critical functions",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data paths present",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names (e.g., mqhQcuqKYDrueODhCkmtyRCYBjKtTBzC), no clear documentation for variable purpose, potential attempt to hide intent; all data is static and benign-looking",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable assignments with static strings. Variable names are intentionally obfuscated but do not perform any actions or malicious activities. No external input handling, no network operations, and no executable logic. The only potential concern is the obfuscation of variable names, which could suggest an attempt to conceal malicious intent, but in this context appears to be mere obfuscation of metadata.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign, serving only as metadata declarations for a Python package. There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious data flow, or malicious code. The obfuscated variable names do not indicate malicious intent but reduce readability.",
