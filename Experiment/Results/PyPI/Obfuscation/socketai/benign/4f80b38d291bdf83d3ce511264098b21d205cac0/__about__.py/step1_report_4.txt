{
  "purpose": "Define metadata variables for a Python package, including title, summary, URI, version, author, email, license, copyright, and other related information.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting string values to variables, including metadata fields and obfuscated-looking variable names.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no data being processed or transmitted to untrusted sources or external systems.",
  "flows": "No significant data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; variables are assigned static string values.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variable names (e.g., mqhQcuqKYDrueODhCkmtyRCYBjKtTBzC), but their use is limited to static string assignments. The code contains no dynamic execution, input handling, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several metadata variables with descriptive string values related to package information. The variable names are intentionally obscure but are only used to hold static strings. There is no evidence of data leakage, malicious code execution, or external communication. The obfuscation appears superficial and does not indicate malicious intent or malware. The overall structure and content are typical for a Python package's metadata module.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard metadata declaration with obfuscated variable names. There is no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks present. The code is safe and appears to be part of a package's informational setup.",
