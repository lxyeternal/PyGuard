{
  "purpose": "Defines module metadata and constants related to a paginator utility for SQLAlchemy or iterables.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded strings and module-level variables; no external input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as database operations, network communication, or data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code primarily sets constants and metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names that do not follow conventional naming; no dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code solely assigns hardcoded strings to variables and sets module-level metadata. Variable names appear intentionally obfuscated but are static. No evidence of input reading, data processing, or output functions. The metadata suggests this is a utility module describing a paginator package. No suspicious code, external data handling, or malicious behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, metadata-defining module with obfuscated variable names but no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
