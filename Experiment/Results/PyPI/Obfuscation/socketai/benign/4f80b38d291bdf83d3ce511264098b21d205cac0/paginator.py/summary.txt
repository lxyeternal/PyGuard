  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated pagination helper with no malicious activity detected. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not equate to malicious intent. The bug in the constructor should be fixed for correctness. The security risk is very low, and the malware score is appropriate at 0."
