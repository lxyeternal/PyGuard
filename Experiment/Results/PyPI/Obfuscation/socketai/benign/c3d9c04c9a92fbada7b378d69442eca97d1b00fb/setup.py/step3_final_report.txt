{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for a Python package, primarily reading README and requirements files, processing dependencies, and invoking a setup function.",
  "sources": "File reads ('README.md', 'requirements.txt'), dependency processing, and the import statement from 'setuptools'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network calls, data exfiltration, or code execution are present.",
  "flows": "The code reads files and dependencies, then calls the setup function; no malicious data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; import statement from 'setuptools' referencing a non-existent attribute 'DceojPVZKzHKwzGRgohxRMGtuGiFjxCj', which is suspicious and likely malicious or obfuscated.",
  "analysis": "The script appears to be a standard setup with superficial obfuscation. The import line is invalid in standard 'setuptools', indicating potential sabotage or concealment. No network activity or malicious operations are evident. The variable obfuscation may be superficial or intended to hide malicious code. The invalid import is a red flag but does not confirm malicious activity on its own.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a superficially obfuscated setup script with an anomalous import statement that could be used to hide malicious modules or backdoors. No active malicious behavior is observed, but the suspicious import warrants further investigation. The overall security risk is low, but the obfuscation and import anomaly should be treated with caution.",
