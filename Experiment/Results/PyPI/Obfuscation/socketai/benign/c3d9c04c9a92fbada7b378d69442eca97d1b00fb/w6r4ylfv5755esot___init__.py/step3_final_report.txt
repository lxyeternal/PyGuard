  "purpose": "Static assignment of personal info, version, and module exports with obfuscated variable names.",
  "sources": "Variable assignments of strings including personal name, email, version, and __all__ list.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data flows present.",
  "flows": "Static data assignments only; no data flow to external systems or functions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, inclusion of personal info, and __all__ list referencing undefined symbols.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string assignments with obfuscated variable names, defining a list __all__ with entries not present in the snippet. No functions, data input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution are observed. The obfuscation appears intentional but benign, serving perhaps to hide constants. The presence of personal info and version strings does not imply malicious intent. All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, reflecting no malicious activity. Obfuscation scores are moderate to high (~0.6-0.7), justified by variable naming. Risk scores are very low (~0.1-0.2), consistent with static data and lack of active behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and obfuscated variable names do not indicate malicious intent. No active security threats or malicious behavior are present. The scores across reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
