  "anomalies": [
    "Use of seemingly random variable names with no clear purpose or context",
    "Variables contain only static strings; no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or external input handling",
    "No code that performs I/O, network operations, or secret handling"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable assignments with hardcoded string values and a list of exported symbols. There are no functions, no input/output, no user data, and no dynamic code execution. The variable names are unusual but not inherently malicious. The presence of obscured variable names might suggest an attempt to hide intent, but in this fragment, they only store static data. Overall, there are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious flows. The code appears benign and typical for a module that exports certain constants.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting only of static variable definitions and a module export list. No malicious behavior or security issues are detected.",
