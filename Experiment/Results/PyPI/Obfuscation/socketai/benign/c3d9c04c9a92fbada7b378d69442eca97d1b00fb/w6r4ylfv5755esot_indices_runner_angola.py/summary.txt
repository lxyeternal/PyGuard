  "confidence": 0.75,
  "conclusion": "The code snippets are heavily obfuscated with placeholder comments and no executable logic, leading to high obfuscation scores but no evidence of malicious activity. Malware risk remains low, and security risk is cautious but acceptable. The reports are consistent and appropriately cautious given the lack of concrete code. Further review of the complete codebase is recommended before deployment."
