  "purpose": "Import a specific symbol from a local module named 'hkc_api'.",
  "sources": "Import statement reading from a local module file 'hkc_api'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data leaks; import statement alone does not process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink activity present in this single import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The imported symbol 'qyALOJbkMYyYqbiRNuBrvqyiZDcAVbuR' appears to be a randomly generated string, which could be obfuscation or an attempt to hide malicious intent. No other code is provided to analyze further.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains an import statement importing a symbol with a seemingly random name from a local module. This does not by itself indicate malicious behavior. The randomness of the symbol name could be suspicious if part of obfuscated or malicious code, but without additional context or code, it is not conclusive. The code does not perform any actions, data processing, or network operations.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this single line, there is no definitive evidence of malicious activity or security risks. However, the use of a seemingly random symbol name could warrant further review if found in a larger context, as it might indicate obfuscation or concealment. No malware or security risks are apparent from this snippet alone.",
