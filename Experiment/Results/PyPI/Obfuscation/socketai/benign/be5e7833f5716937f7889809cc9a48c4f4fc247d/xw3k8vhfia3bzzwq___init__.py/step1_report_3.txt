{
  "purpose": "Import a specific symbol from a local module named 'hkc_api'.",
  "sources": "The import statement accesses the module 'hkc_api' and imports 'qyALOJbkMYyYqbiRNuBrvqyiZDcAVbuR'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling observed in this line.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are visible in this single import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The imported symbol name 'qyALOJbkMYyYqbiRNuBrvqyiZDcAVbuR' appears to be a randomly generated string, which could be suspicious if used to hide malicious intent. No other code present to analyze behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement importing a symbol with a nonsensical name from a local module. There are no obvious signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, code execution, or backdoors. The unusual symbol name may be an obfuscation tactic or generated to hide malicious code, but without additional context, it remains ambiguous.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this single import statement, there is no definitive evidence of malicious behavior. However, the random nature of the imported symbol name warrants further review of the full module to ensure no malicious intent is hidden elsewhere.",
