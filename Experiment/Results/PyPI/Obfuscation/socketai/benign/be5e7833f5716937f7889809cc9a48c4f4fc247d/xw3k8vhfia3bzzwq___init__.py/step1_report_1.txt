  "purpose": "Import a specific function or object 'qyALOJbkMYyYqbiRNuBrvqyiZDcAVbuR' from a local module named 'hkc_api'.",
  "sources": "Import statement reading from a relative module 'hkc_api'.",
  "sinks": "None in the provided code; no data flows or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow or data processing present; only an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The imported name 'qyALOJbkMYyYqbiRNuBrvqyiZDcAVbuR' appears as a nonsensical or obfuscated identifier, which could indicate code obfuscation or malicious intent. The code lacks context or additional logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single import statement from a local module. The imported name is a long, seemingly random string, which is atypical for standard function or variable names and may be used to obfuscate intent. There are no additional code lines, data processing, or network activity. The import alone does not indicate malicious behavior but, given the suspicious identifier, could be an attempt at obfuscation or hiding malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code by itself is minimal and does not demonstrate malicious activity; however, the obfuscated naming suggests a need for caution. It could be a component of a larger malicious payload or obfuscated malicious code, but based solely on this snippet, it is not definitively malicious. The overall risk is low but warrants further review if part of a larger codebase.",
