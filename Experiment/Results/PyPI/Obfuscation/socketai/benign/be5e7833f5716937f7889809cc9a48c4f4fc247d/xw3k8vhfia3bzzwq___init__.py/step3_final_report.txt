  "purpose": "Assess the security implications of a single import statement with an obfuscated symbol in a Python module.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .hkc_api importing qyALOJbkMYyYqbiRNuBrvqyiZDcAVbuR.",
  "sinks": "Potentially the imported symbol could be used in code execution, data handling, or network activity if further code exists.",
  "flows": "Importing the symbol from the module, which could lead to its usage elsewhere in the codebase.",
  "anomalies": "The imported symbol name appears as a long, nonsensical string, indicating obfuscation or auto-generation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal import statement with an obfuscated symbol, which is suspicious but not inherently malicious. The scores across reports reflect suspicion due to naming but acknowledge the lack of evidence for malicious activity. The malware score is low (0.2), consistent with no active malicious behavior observed. The obfuscated score is high (~0.75), justified by the suspicious naming. The security risk remains low (~0.2-0.3), but further review of the larger codebase and usage of the symbol is recommended to confirm safety.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet is benign in isolation but uses obfuscated naming that warrants caution. No active malicious behavior is demonstrated, but further investigation into the module and how the symbol is used is advised to rule out hidden malicious payloads.",
