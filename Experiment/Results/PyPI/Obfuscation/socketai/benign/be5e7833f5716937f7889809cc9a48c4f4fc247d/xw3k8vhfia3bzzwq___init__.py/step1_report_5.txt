  "purpose": "Import a specific function or object named 'qyALOJbkMYyYqbiRNuBrvqyiZDcAVbuR' from the module '.hkc_api'.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from a local module file '.hkc_api'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed in this fragment.",
  "flows": "The imported object may be used later in the code (not provided), but this fragment only shows the import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The imported name 'qyALOJbkMYyYqbiRNuBrvqyiZDcAVbuR' appears as a seemingly random or obfuscated identifier, which could indicate intentional obfuscation or concealment. No other anomalies are evident in this single line.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific object from a local module file, with no additional context. The obfuscated or nonsensical name might be used to conceal malicious intent or to evade detection. However, based solely on this import statement, there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior or security issues. The code does not contain input handling, data leaks, or suspicious network activity at this point.",
  "conclusion": "This single import statement alone does not demonstrate malicious intent or security risks. The obfuscated naming could be for benign reasons or concealment. Without further context or additional code, there is no indication of malware or security threats.",
