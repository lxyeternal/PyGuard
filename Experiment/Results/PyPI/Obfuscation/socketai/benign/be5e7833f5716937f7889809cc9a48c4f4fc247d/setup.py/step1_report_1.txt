  "purpose": "To set up a Python package by defining metadata and dependencies using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading the current directory path, reading requirements.txt file for dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data handling or output actions.",
  "flows": "Directory path read -> requirements.txt content read -> setup configuration applied.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of non-descriptive variable names, but no malicious patterns or suspicious code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. It dynamically reads the requirements.txt file to specify install_requires, which is standard practice. Variable names are obfuscated, which is unusual but not necessarily malicious. No hardcoded credentials, no network activity, no code execution or data leaks observed. The setup configuration appears typical for a Python package. The obfuscation of variable names could be an attempt to hide intent, but given the context, it does not indicate malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script for a Python package with obfuscated variable names. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected based on the code provided.",
