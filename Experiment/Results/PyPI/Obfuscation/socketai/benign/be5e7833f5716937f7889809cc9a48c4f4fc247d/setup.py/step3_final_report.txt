  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging a Python project, reading dependencies from requirements.txt and defining package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'requirements.txt' for dependencies, obfuscated variable assignments, and the setup() function call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or network activity; no malicious code execution detected.",
  "flows": "Reading dependencies from external file -> passing to setup() without further processing.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, a suspicious string 'LdYXiPPCiOudmvzPysRdcFILJyTAycAU=' assigned but unused, and inconsistent string assignment in comments. No active malicious code or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with obfuscated variable names, which hampers readability but does not inherently indicate malicious intent. The suspicious string is not used or executed, and no code injection, network activity, or data exfiltration is present. The obfuscation raises caution but is not sufficient evidence of malicious behavior. The scores across reports correctly reflect low malware risk (0), moderate obfuscation (around 0.6), and low security risk (around 0.2). The confidence scores are high, given the straightforward analysis. No evidence suggests active malicious intent, only obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with obfuscated variable names and a suspicious but unused string. No malicious activity or code execution is detected. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not justify high malware risk. The overall security risk remains low, and the malware score should be 0. The obfuscation score is moderate due to variable naming, and the security risk score is low. No further action is necessary beyond standard review.",
