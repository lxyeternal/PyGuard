  "sinks": "Loading dependencies from an external file; no direct data leaks or untrusted data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Read dependencies from 'requirements.txt' file during setup process.",
  "anomalies": "The variable naming appears obfuscated and inconsistent (e.g., 'nFGxIYbKUpOSDIHvSiqymDpoJNVLIveh'), which is unusual for typical setup scripts. The variable for 'long_description' appears to be a base64 or random string, but it is assigned as a string, not used further. No code executes malicious commands or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs package setup tasks: defining package name, version, dependencies, description, and classifiers. The variable names are obfuscated, which is atypical for clean code but not inherently malicious. The 'install_requires' reads dependencies from 'requirements.txt', which is standard practice. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. The obfuscation could be an attempt to hide intent but is more likely a red herring or poor code style.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard setup configuration with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The obfuscation might warrant further review but does not suggest malicious intent based solely on this code.",
