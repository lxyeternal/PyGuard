{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define some metadata variables related to a developer or project, and includes functions returning current timestamps.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks as no external input handling or data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behavior are present. Variables contain static strings, and functions simply return the current timestamp.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several variables with what seem to be author or project metadata, including an email, license info, and version. The functions return current date/time in local and UTC formats. There is no evidence of data leakage, malicious commands, or suspicious activity. No external dependencies or code execution are present. The code is straightforward and seems to serve as metadata or utility functions.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains only metadata definitions and timestamp functions with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any harmful operations or data handling that could be malicious.",
