{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set metadata information such as author, license, and version, along with functions to get current timestamps.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads input or data from external sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no operations that output data to external systems, files, or network connections.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; functions only return current datetime values.",
  "anomalies": "Variables contain obfuscated or non-descriptive names, but no malicious or suspicious code is present. No hardcoded secrets or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes metadata variables, which are benign and commonly used for package info. The functions simply return the current datetime, either local or UTC, without any side effects or external interactions. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors, are evident. Variable names are obscure, but this does not imply malicious intent; it may be for obfuscation or simple naming.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and serves to store package metadata and provide timestamp functions. No malicious or suspicious activity is present.",
