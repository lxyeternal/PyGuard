{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set metadata variables such as author, copyright, license, and version, and defines two functions to retrieve the current date and time, with one in local time and one in UTC.",
  "sources": "The functions use datetime.now() and datetime.now(timezone.utc) to read the current system date and time.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any data sinks, outputs, or untrusted data handling that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The source functions are called to retrieve timestamps, but there are no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The variables storing metadata are hardcoded strings with no signs of obfuscation or malicious content. The functions are straightforward and do not execute or process untrusted input. No suspicious or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly sets static metadata variables related to author, license, and version. It includes two functions that return the current timestamp in local and UTC time. There are no input handling, data processing, or network activities. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The functions are simple wrappers around standard library calls. Overall, the code does not exhibit malicious intent or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a metadata and timestamp utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is benign and unlikely to be used maliciously.",
