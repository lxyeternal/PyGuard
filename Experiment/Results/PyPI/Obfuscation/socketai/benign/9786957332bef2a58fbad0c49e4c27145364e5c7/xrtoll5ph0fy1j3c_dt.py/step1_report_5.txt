  "purpose": "Store and possibly display author and license information, and provide functions to get current timestamps.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources; the code uses system date/time functions.",
  "sinks": "No data output or external network connections present.",
  "flows": "Function calls to datetime.now() and datetime.now(timezone.utc) return current timestamps.",
  "anomalies": "Use of variable names that appear obfuscated or nonsensical; no clear purpose for variable assignments; no external data or user input handling; functions merely return timestamps. No malicious code or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several variables containing author, license, and version info, which seem to serve informational purposes. It includes two functions that return the current local and UTC timestamps. There are no indications of data leaks, code injection, or malicious behaviors. The variable names are unusual but not inherently malicious. No external network activity, data collection, or obfuscation techniques are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign, informational snippet primarily storing metadata and providing timestamp functions. No malicious activity or security risks are detected.",
