{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define metadata and utility functions to retrieve the current date and time, both local and UTC.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only assigns string literals to variables and defines functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows leading to untrusted outputs or external systems are present.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the functions simply return the current datetime without any external data.",
  "anomalies": "Variables contain hardcoded personal information and license details, which are not inherently malicious but could be considered unnecessary or privacy-sensitive. No suspicious code patterns or obfuscated constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code sets several variables with personal and license info, then defines two functions to fetch the current date/time. The functions use standard library calls with no external inputs or suspicious behavior. No malicious intent or malware indicators are visible. The variables include personal info which may be privacy-sensitive but not malicious. The functions are straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily setting metadata and providing simple date/time functions. There is no malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
