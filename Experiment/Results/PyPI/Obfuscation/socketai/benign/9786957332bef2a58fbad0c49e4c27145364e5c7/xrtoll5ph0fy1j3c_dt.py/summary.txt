  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as metadata and timestamp utilities. No malicious activity or security concerns are evident. The low malware score (0), slight obfuscation score (~0.1), and minimal risk score (~0.1) are justified. The reports accurately reflect this benign nature, and no modifications are necessary."
