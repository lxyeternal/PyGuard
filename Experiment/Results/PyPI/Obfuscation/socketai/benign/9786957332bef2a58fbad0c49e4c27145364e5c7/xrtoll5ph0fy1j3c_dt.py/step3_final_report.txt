  "purpose": "Metadata variables (author, license, version) and two timestamp functions returning current local and UTC time.",
  "sources": "Code reads static string variables and calls standard library functions for current datetime.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or network activity; functions only return timestamp objects.",
  "flows": "Functions retrieve current datetime; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are obscure but contain no malicious content; no obfuscation techniques or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, defining static metadata and timestamp functions with no external input, data processing, or network activity. Variable names are non-descriptive but not malicious. Functions use standard library calls without obfuscation or malicious intent. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. The code serves as metadata and utility functions, with minimal security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as metadata and timestamp utilities. No malicious activity or security concerns are evident. The low malware score (0), slight obfuscation score (~0.1), and minimal risk score (~0.1) are justified. The reports accurately reflect this benign nature, and no modifications are necessary.",
