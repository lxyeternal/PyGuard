{
  "purpose": "The code defines metadata strings and a meta class that restricts attribute setting/deletion and prevents instantiation, likely for obfuscation or control purposes.",
  "sources": "Metadata string assignments; class attribute modification attempts; class instantiation attempt.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data or network interactions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; restrictions are enforced via exceptions in class methods.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable and class names; raising NotImplementedError in attribute methods and constructor; restrictive class behavior without external data flow.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily metadata and a restrictive meta class pattern. It does not perform any malicious actions, network activity, or data exfiltration. The use of exceptions to prevent attribute modification and instantiation is unusual but not malicious, possibly serving as obfuscation or anti-tampering. Scores across reports consistently show zero malware likelihood, with obfuscation scores justified by naming and pattern complexity. The overall security risk is low, aligning with the absence of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is an obfuscated, restrictive class pattern with no evidence of malicious intent or active security threats. It may serve as an obfuscation or control mechanism but does not pose a security risk.",
