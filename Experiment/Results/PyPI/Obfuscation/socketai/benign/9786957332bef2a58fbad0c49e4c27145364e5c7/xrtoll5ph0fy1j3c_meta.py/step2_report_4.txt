  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Assigns metadata strings (author, license, version).\n- Defines a meta class (`LVDAvIxoQmcputbRmXZurKZVJuLhHLqs`) that raises `NotImplementedError` on attribute set/delete.\n- Defines a class (`ueZuAJHZBPBHQrVJXSVmBGRXFtTHVcmr`) that uses this meta class and raises `NotImplementedError` on instantiation.\n- The code is obfuscated with strange variable and class names but contains no network, file, or external data interactions.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code does **not** perform any malicious actions.\n- It simply restricts class attribute modifications and prevents instantiation.\n- No data leaks, network activity, or external interactions are evident.\n- The restrictions could be used for obfuscation or to enforce strict class invariants.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- The use of `NotImplementedError` in `__init__` and attribute methods is unusual but not inherently malicious.\n- The obfuscated naming could hinder understanding but isn't a security flaw.\n- No actual vulnerabilities are present.\n\n### Score Review:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Varies between 0.2 and 0.8, reflecting some obfuscation but not heavily malicious.\n- **Risk Score:** Generally low (~0.1-0.2), which aligns with the analysis that this is not malicious.\n\n### Justification for Scores:\n- Since there's no malicious behavior, malware score should remain 0.\n- Obfuscation is moderate due to naming but not malicious.\n- The overall security risk remains low, as the code doesn't pose a threat.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation of Reports:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is mainly metadata and a restrictive class pattern.\n- They note the unusual use of raising `NotImplementedError` but correctly conclude it's not malicious.\n- The confidence levels are high, which seems justified.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- No change needed for scores; they are consistent.\n- The obfuscation score could be slightly higher if considering the strange variable names, but it's acceptable as is.\n- The malware score should stay at 0.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** ~0.3 (moderate obfuscation due to naming, but no complex obfuscation techniques)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal security risk, mainly obfuscation)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is primarily metadata and a restrictive meta class pattern, with no evidence of malicious intent. The reports are accurate, and the scores are reasonable. The code may be obfuscated, but it does not pose a security threat.",
