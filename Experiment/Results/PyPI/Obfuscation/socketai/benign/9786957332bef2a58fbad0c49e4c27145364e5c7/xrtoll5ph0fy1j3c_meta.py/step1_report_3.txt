  "purpose": "Define a metaclass that restricts attribute setting and deletion, and a class that uses this metaclass, raising errors on instantiation.",
  "sources": "String assignments at the top of the code, class and metaclass definitions.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks are present; no external data or network interactions.",
  "flows": "Initialization of class and metaclass -> attempts to instantiate class -> errors thrown.",
  "anomalies": "Use of raise NotImplementedError to prevent class instantiation and attribute modification, possibly to hide underlying intentions. No clear malicious behavior, but unusual pattern for restricting class usage.",
  "analysis": "The code defines string variables containing what appear to be metadata (author, license, version). It then creates a metaclass that forbids setting or deleting attributes, raising NotImplementedError if such actions are attempted. A class using this metaclass also raises NotImplementedError upon instantiation, preventing object creation. This pattern can be used to hinder inspection or modification but does not directly perform malicious actions such as data exfiltration or system modification. No suspicious external communications, credential handling, or obfuscated code present.",
  "conclusion": "The code establishes a restrictive class and metaclass, likely for obfuscation or to prevent class instantiation and modification. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or malware in this snippet, but the restrictive design is unusual and could be part of a larger malicious scheme or an anti-debugging technique.",
