  "purpose": "Define a meta class with restricted attribute modification and prevent instantiation of classes using this meta class.",
  "sources": "String assignments with metadata, class definition with meta class",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data flows to external systems or outputs",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "Use of meta class to restrict attribute setting and deletion, raising NotImplementedError in __init__ to prevent instantiation",
  "analysis": "The code assigns metadata strings to variables, likely for documentation purposes. It defines a meta class that blocks attribute setting and deletion outside class definition by raising NotImplementedError. The class ueZuAJHZBPBHQrVJXSVmBGRXFtTHVcmr uses this meta class and raises NotImplementedError upon instantiation, effectively preventing any instances from being created. The overall structure appears to enforce strict class attribute control and prevent object instantiation, which could be suspicious if used maliciously to obfuscate or restrict behavior, but in itself is not malicious. No network, file, or external data interactions are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a restrictive meta class and a class that cannot be instantiated, possibly for obfuscation or security enforcement. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malware, just unusual restrictions on class attributes and instantiation.",
