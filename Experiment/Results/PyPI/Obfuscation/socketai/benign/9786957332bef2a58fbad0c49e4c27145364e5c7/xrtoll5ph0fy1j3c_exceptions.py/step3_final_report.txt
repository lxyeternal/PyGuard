{
  "purpose": "Defines multiple custom exception classes with static string attributes, likely serving as placeholders or metadata.",
  "sources": "Static string assignments to class attributes and variables.",
  "sinks": "None; no input/output or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static assignments only.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names, no functional logic, potential obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions with string attributes and variable assignments. No dynamic behavior, data flow, or external interactions are present. Obfuscation is evident but appears to serve as placeholder or metadata rather than malicious intent. No evidence of malicious activity such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code injection. The high obfuscation scores are justified, but malware likelihood is minimal.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, mainly obfuscated placeholder or metadata code, with no active malicious behavior. The security risk is very low, and the malware score should be set to 0.0. Obfuscation is present but not indicative of malicious intent.",
