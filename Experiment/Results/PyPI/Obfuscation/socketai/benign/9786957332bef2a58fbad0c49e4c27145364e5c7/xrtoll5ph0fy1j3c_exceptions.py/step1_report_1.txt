{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define multiple custom exception classes with associated string attributes, likely serving as identifiers or constants for internal use.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded string literals assigned to class attributes and variable assignments, with no external input sources present.",
  "sinks": "There are no obvious sinks such as network operations, file writes, or other data leak points. The code does not perform any data output or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code only defines classes and variables with static strings, with no dynamic data handling or processing.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of multiple custom exception classes with non-descriptive, seemingly random string attributes suggests obfuscated or intentionally obscure code. No clear functionality is implemented.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of string assignments to class attributes within exception class definitions and standalone variables. There is no dynamic code execution, user input processing, or system interactions. The structure indicates possible obfuscation or placeholder code. It does not contain any malicious behaviors such as network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications. The overall pattern suggests low risk but raises suspicion of intent to hide or obscure functionality, perhaps as part of larger, hidden logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code by itself appears benign and mainly consists of class and variable definitions with obfuscated string literals. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident within this fragment. However, the unusual naming and structure could indicate an intent to hide malicious behavior in a larger context.",
