{
  "purpose": "Define database models with timestamp fields, including primary key and timestamp defaults.",
  "sources": "The module imports 'Model', 'Field', and 'sZMDATJsqbXOJiPcocLuFGeyosCpyvfi' from 'morm' package; the code also assigns metadata strings with contact and license info.",
  "sinks": "The code does not directly handle untrusted input or output data; no apparent sinks for untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows from sources to sinks; code primarily defines data models and default values.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of base64-like obfuscated string 'sZMDATJsqbXOJiPcocLuFGeyosCpyvfi' used as default value; the rest appears standard. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two model classes inheriting from a base 'Model'. The first class 'ftZLTkTDLeGRoTHDNHdNnpCNJdCaFNUI' contains a primary key 'id'. The second class 'IJqJZaEedRnsWYYJjvJzpDxvUHcqEdVg' inherits from the first and adds timestamp fields with default and auto-update behavior. The only notable anomaly is the usage of 'sZMDATJsqbXOJiPcocLuFGeyosCpyvfi' as a default value for a timestamp, which is imported from 'morm.dt' but appears obfuscated. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The strings at the top are metadata, not executable code. Overall, the code is a straightforward model definition with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical ORM model definition with obfuscated default timestamp data. No malicious behaviors or security risks are evident. The obfuscated string may warrant further review, but it does not indicate malicious activity on its own.",
