  "purpose": "Define ORM models with timestamp fields, including default values set via an external obfuscated function, and include contact/license info.",
  "sources": "External function 'sZMDATJsqbXOJiPcocLuFGeyosCpyvfi' used as default timestamp, imported from 'morm.dt'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leakage or malicious data flows detected.",
  "flows": "Model creation -> default timestamp via external function; no malicious flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated external function for default timestamp; variable names are obfuscated; no malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines ORM models with timestamp fields, using an external function for default values. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The obfuscation and reliance on an external function could be potential vectors if untrusted, but there is no direct evidence of malicious activity. The code appears to be standard ORM schema with obfuscated variable names, which may be stylistic or to hinder static analysis. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with this assessment, with malware scores at 0 or near 0, obfuscated scores at 0.7 justified by variable naming and external function, and low security risk scores around 0.2–0.3 due to obfuscation and external dependency. Overall, the code does not exhibit malicious intent or activity, but the obfuscation and external function warrant cautious review in a security-critical context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard ORM schema with obfuscated variable names and external timestamp functions. No malicious activity or security risks are evident. The obfuscation and external dependencies suggest caution but do not indicate malicious intent. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0.7, and risk=0.2 are justified and appropriate.",
