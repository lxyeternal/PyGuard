  "purpose": "Define database models with timestamp fields using the morm ORM library.",
  "sources": "Constants containing author information and license details; import statements; class attribute definitions; use of external module 'morm' functions and classes.",
  "sinks": "Potential database interactions via the ORM framework; use of default timestamp values; no direct data sinks evident, but model definitions could lead to database manipulation.",
  "flows": "Model class definitions and their fields, especially the timestamp fields, with default values and SQL commands.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded author and license info as constants; use of an external function 'sZMDATJsqbXOJiPcocLuFGeyosCpyvfi' as a default value for a timestamp field. The purpose of this function is not clear from the snippet. No suspicious code or malicious behavior detected. No obfuscated code, no suspicious data handling, no external network activity, or credential usage.",
  "analysis": "The code defines ORM models with fields for ID and timestamps, incorporating external function for timestamp default. The constants contain author/license info, but they are not used in sensitive operations or for malicious purposes. The imported modules appear standard for ORM model definitions. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The external function usage is normal for dynamic default values, assuming it provides a timestamp. No anomalies like hardcoded secrets, code injection, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward ORM model definition for database tables with timestamp fields. No malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks are identified. It mainly serves as part of a data modeling layer without any evident security issues.",
