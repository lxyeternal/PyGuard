  "purpose": "Store author information, license details, version, and define a string formatting function.",
  "sources": "Global variables containing strings and a function parameter.",
  "sinks": "The function returns a formatted string using the input and quote character.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (name and quote) flow into the function and are used to produce a formatted string.",
  "anomalies": "The function references a variable 'name' which is not defined within its scope or as a parameter, leading to a NameError if called.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several global variables with seemingly benign content related to author, license, and version. The function hNQtDRIcRdKDyrfYtAQjNGtiCFRPMnfm intends to return a string with quotes around a name, but uses an undefined variable 'name', which suggests a coding error rather than malicious intent. There are no indications of data leakage, malicious behavior, or suspicious code execution. No external data sources or sinks are present. The code appears to be straightforward, with the only issue being a likely bug due to an undefined variable.",
  "conclusion": "The code is intended for formatting a name with quotes but contains an undefined variable 'name', which would cause runtime errors. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. The overall security risk is minimal, but the code has a bug.",
