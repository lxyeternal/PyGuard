  "purpose": "Store static metadata (author, license, version) and provide a string quoting function.",
  "sources": "The function `hNQtDRIcRdKDyrfYtAQjNGtiCFRPMnfm` reads its parameter `cfrNwkEilLuDmgBcEeAHNSAaAogxfJji` for input; no external data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "The function returns a formatted string; no untrusted data sinks or external effects are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameter `cfrNwkEilLuDmgBcEeAHNSAaAogxfJji` flows into the return statement via string formatting, but the function references an undefined variable `name`, which causes a runtime error; no malicious data flow exists.",
  "anomalies": "The function references an undefined variable `name` instead of its parameter, indicating a bug. Variable and function names appear obfuscated or auto-generated, but this is superficial and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines static metadata variables and a string quoting function that contains a bug referencing an undefined variable. No external data flows, network activity, or malicious payloads are present. The obfuscated-looking variable names and function name suggest obfuscation but not malicious intent. The bug would cause runtime errors if invoked but does not introduce security vulnerabilities. Malware score is 0; obfuscation score is moderate (~0.4-0.7) due to variable naming; security risk is minimal (~0.1). The code is benign but buggy.",
  "conclusion": "The code is static metadata with a simple function containing a bug (undefined variable reference). There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The obfuscation appears superficial. The scores assigned are appropriate; malware score remains 0, and risk is very low. The main issue is a bug that should be fixed for proper functionality, but it does not pose security concerns.",
