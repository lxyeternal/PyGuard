  "conclusion": "The code is static metadata with a simple function containing a bug (undefined variable reference). There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The obfuscation appears superficial. The scores assigned are appropriate; malware score remains 0, and risk is very low. The main issue is a bug that should be fixed for proper functionality, but it does not pose security concerns."
