  "purpose": "Minimal import statement importing a symbol with a nonsensical name from a local module, likely part of a larger package.",
  "sources": "Import statement sourcing 'xouaRzGDpmTvFVDZykrchGmpfjETQfvs' from '.source' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows present; no external communication or data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Import source to local namespace; no data flow beyond import.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated, randomly generated symbol name indicating potential obfuscation or hiding.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, with a single import of a suspiciously named symbol. No behavior or data processing is evident. The high obfuscation score is justified by the nonsensical name, but malware activity cannot be inferred. The low risk score aligns with the absence of malicious actions. The suspicion is solely based on naming, not behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not demonstrate malicious activity but the obfuscated import name warrants further review of the source module. No immediate threat is evident from this snippet alone, but the obfuscation suggests caution. Scores are consistent with the evidence; malware remains at 0-0.2, obfuscation high at 0.7, and security risk low at 0.1-0.2.",
