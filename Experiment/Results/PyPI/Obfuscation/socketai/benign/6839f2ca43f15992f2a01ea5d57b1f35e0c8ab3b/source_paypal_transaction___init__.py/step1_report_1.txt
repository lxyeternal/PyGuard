  "purpose": "Import a specific object from a local source module and expose a class name for external use",
  "sources": "The code reads the import statement from a local module called .source",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; the code only performs a standard import and list declaration",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code does not handle data dynamically",
  "anomalies": "The imported object name 'xouaRzGDpmTvFVDZykrchGmpfjETQfvs' appears to be a randomly generated string, which may indicate obfuscation or malicious intent; no other anomalies present",
  "analysis": "The code imports a symbol with a seemingly random name from a local module, which could be indicative of obfuscation or malicious intent. The __all__ declaration limits what is exported, which is standard practice. There are no other operations, data handling, or behavior. The randomness of the imported symbol suggests potential obfuscation, but on its own, this does not confirm malicious activity. No external data processing or sensitive operations are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal and appears to be a straightforward import statement with an obfuscated symbol name. While the symbol name is unusual, there is no explicit malicious behavior or security risk evident from this snippet alone. Further context of the source module would be needed for a definitive assessment.",
