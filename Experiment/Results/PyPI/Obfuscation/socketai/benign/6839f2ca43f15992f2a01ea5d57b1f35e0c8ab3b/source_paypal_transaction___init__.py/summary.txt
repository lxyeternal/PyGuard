  "conclusion": "The code does not demonstrate malicious activity but the obfuscated import name warrants further review of the source module. No immediate threat is evident from this snippet alone, but the obfuscation suggests caution. Scores are consistent with the evidence; malware remains at 0-0.2, obfuscation high at 0.7, and security risk low at 0.1-0.2."
