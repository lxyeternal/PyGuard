  "purpose": "Import a specific object from a relative source module and define an export list.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from a relative module '.source' via an import statement.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data flows in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "The source (import) does not lead to any subsequent data flow or processing within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The imported identifier 'xouaRzGDpmTvFVDZykrchGmpfjETQfvs' appears as a nonsensical, random string, which could suggest obfuscation or malicious intent, but without further context, it is not conclusive.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a symbol with a highly obfuscated or random name from a relative module and defines an export list containing a single, clear string. The import does not involve dynamic execution or untrusted input. The presence of an obfuscated symbol may be suspicious, but it could also be legitimate code with non-descriptive naming. No suspicious or malicious activity is explicitly evident from this minimal snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a simple import and export definition. The random symbol name warrants caution, but there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior. The overall security risk appears low, though the obfuscated name suggests further review of the source module may be prudent.",
