  "purpose": "Define a subclass of YamlDeclarativeSource that loads configuration from 'manifest.yaml'.",
  "sources": "Imports logging module; imports YamlDeclarativeSource from airbyte_cdk.sources.declarative.yaml_declarative_source.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "The constructor calls the superclass constructor with a hardcoded path to 'manifest.yaml', which could be a configuration file.",
  "anomalies": "Class name appears obfuscated or randomly generated; no use of environment variables or dynamic data; no obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic execution; no credentials or secrets present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass with an unusual name, possibly obfuscated, that loads configuration from a fixed YAML file. No evidence of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful commands. The code is straightforward and does not process untrusted input. It is a simple class definition with a fixed configuration path, typical in configuration-based setups.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no malicious intent. The obfuscated class name could suggest an attempt at hiding purpose, but it does not perform any malicious actions. No security risks or malware are detected.",
