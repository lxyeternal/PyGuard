  "sources": "No clear input or data reading points; the code appears to be a command or comment rather than executable code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data processing or output points identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code does not demonstrate data processing or transmission.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a command description or comment rather than executable Python code; presence of a command-like string without actual code implementation.",
  "analysis": "The provided snippet is not valid executable Python code but appears to be a description or annotation indicating that the Wheel tool enables the 'python -m wheel' command syntax. It does not contain any logic, data handling, or code execution paths. Since there are no functions, imports, or data manipulations, there are no security concerns such as malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscated code. The text does not show signs of malicious intent or malicious code fragments.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet is a descriptive comment or instruction string without executable code or malicious intent. No security risks are associated with it.",
