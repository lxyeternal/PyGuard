  "purpose": "This code snippet appears to be a descriptive comment or string indicating that the 'wheel' command enables the 'python -m wheel' syntax. It is not executable code.",
  "sources": "The string itself, which is a comment or descriptive text; no data input or external sources are read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present, as there is no untrusted data flow or code execution.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the snippet is static and non-executable.",
  "anomalies": "The presence of a seemingly random string 'yZxQqeWcdlBxRQrPXRguxbKxKSXLlXfK' could suggest obfuscation or placeholder use, but it does not perform any malicious action.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely a descriptive comment with no executable logic. The random string does not influence behavior and appears to be a placeholder or obfuscation. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious activity is evident. The security implications are minimal, and the scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated≈0.2-0.3, risk=0) are appropriate. Confidence in the benign nature of this snippet is high (around 0.9), given the lack of executable content and malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet is a non-executable descriptive comment with no malicious intent or security risk. The obfuscated-looking string does not constitute malicious behavior. The current scores and assessments are accurate and justified.",
