  "purpose": "Provides functionality related to the Python wheel package, enabling the 'python -m wheel' syntax.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources detected in the provided code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating data leaks or untrusted data usage detected.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows identified in the provided code.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a seemingly random string 'yZxQqeWcdlBxRQrPXRguxbKxKSXLlXfK' which appears as an obfuscated or nonsensical token; lacks context or explanation.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet references a wheel command and an obfuscated string, which may be an artifact, placeholder, or obfuscated data. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as network activity, file manipulation, or credential handling. The presence of the string without context is suspicious but does not directly imply malicious intent. The code does not perform any actions, imports, or operations that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a minimal or incomplete fragment related to the Python wheel package. The nonsensical string may be obfuscation or placeholder data, but there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks based on the given content.",
