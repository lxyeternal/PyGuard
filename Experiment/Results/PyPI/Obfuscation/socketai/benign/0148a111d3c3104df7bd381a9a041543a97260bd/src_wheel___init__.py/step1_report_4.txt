{
  "purpose": "Assigns a string value representing a version number to a variable.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; only a static string assignment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks are present; no untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; simple assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "The variable name appears obfuscated or randomly generated, which may be unusual but not malicious by itself.",
  "analysis": "The code imports __future__ annotations, which is standard for forward references in type hints, and assigns a string representing a version number to a variable with a non-descriptive, seemingly obfuscated name. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The use of a complex variable name may be an attempt to conceal intent, but this alone is insufficient to determine maliciousness. Overall, the code is minimal, straightforward, and does not exhibit malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign assignment with no malicious intent. It is a simple import statement and variable assignment, with no security risks detected.",
