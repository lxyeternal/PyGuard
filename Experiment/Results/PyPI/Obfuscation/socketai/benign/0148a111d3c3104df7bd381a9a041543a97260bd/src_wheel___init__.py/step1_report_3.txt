  "purpose": "Assign a version string to a variable, possibly indicating a package version.",
  "sources": "The code itself does not read any input or external data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data leaks or untrusted data usage.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks since only a variable assignment is present.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable name 'zcNtmcIrjKmBQHwPttzOqwUzgiKviTsg' that appears random and obfuscated. The version string '0.46.1' is straightforward but the variable name suggests obfuscation or intentional hiding.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports __future__ features and assigns a version string to a highly obfuscated variable name. There are no external inputs, no data processing, or behavior that could be malicious. The variable name's randomness might be for obfuscation, but no malicious activity is indicated.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal and does not contain malicious behavior. The obfuscated variable name suggests possible intent to hide the purpose, but it does not perform any harmful actions. Overall, there are no security concerns based on this snippet.",
