{
  "purpose": "Define a string variable with a version number, likely for internal use or package metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads a string literal assigned to a variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths; the code is static.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable name with a seemingly random string, but no malicious behavior or obfuscation; the use of __future__ import is standard for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a feature from __future__ and assigns a version string to a variable with an obfuscated name. No dynamic execution, no external input, no data leaks, and no suspicious activity are present. The variable name appears intentionally obscure but is not inherently malicious. The __future__ import is a common practice for compatibility and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only to define a version string with an unconventional variable name. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
