{
  "purpose": "Assign a version string to a variable with obfuscated naming, likely for namespace or packaging purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input, data, or environment variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or external data flows are present; no potential data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code only performs a simple assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable name; minimal code structure; no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a __future__ feature and assigns a benign version string to an obfuscated variable name. No external inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present. The obfuscation appears superficial, likely for namespace or packaging reasons, not malicious intent. Multiple reports agree on the benign nature, with some noting the obfuscation level. No signs of malware, backdoors, or security risks are detected. The malware score should be 0, the obfuscation score around 0.7 reflecting the variable name complexity, and the security risk score low (~0.1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious activity or security threats. The obfuscation is superficial and does not indicate malicious intent. The current scores are appropriate, with a slight increase in obfuscation score justified by the variable name complexity.",
