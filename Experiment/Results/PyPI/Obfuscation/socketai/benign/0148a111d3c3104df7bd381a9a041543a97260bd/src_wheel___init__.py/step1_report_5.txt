  "purpose": "Assigns a version string to a variable, likely for version tracking or package metadata.",
  "sources": "The string assignment from a string literal to a variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external output.",
  "flows": "N/A; only a simple assignment without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable name consisting of a long, seemingly random string; no other code or logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single import statement and a variable assignment. The import is for __future__, which is used for compatibility features in Python and is common in package code. The variable name appears obfuscated or generated, and it is assigned a version string. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious operations. The code appears benign and minimal.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple version assignment with an unusual variable name, likely used for package versioning. No malicious activity or security risks are evident.",
