{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, defining package metadata, dependencies, entry points, and configuration.",
  "sources": "Code reads static data such as package name, version, dependencies, and entry points; no untrusted input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to security vulnerabilities identified.",
  "flows": "No flow from external or untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; data is statically defined.",
  "anomalies": "The code is obfuscated with non-descriptive variable names, which is unusual for a setup script. The use of 'distutils' instead of 'setuptools' could indicate outdated or less common practice, but not necessarily malicious. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py configuration with obfuscated variable names, likely to hinder readability. It imports 'distutils.core' instead of the more common 'setuptools', but does not execute any suspicious actions. All data appears to be static and related to package configuration. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names, possibly to deter casual inspection. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided content.",
