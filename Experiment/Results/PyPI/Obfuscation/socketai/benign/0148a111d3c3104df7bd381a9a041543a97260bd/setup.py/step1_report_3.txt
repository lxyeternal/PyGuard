{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package, intended to define package metadata, dependencies, and entry points for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads data from hardcoded strings, dictionaries, and lists for package configuration (name, version, dependencies, entry points).",
  "sinks": "Uses the setup() function to process configuration data; no direct data sinks or external network/output calls are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from hardcoded variables into the setup() function arguments to configure package distribution.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names provide little context; the code appears intentionally obscured but contains no signs of malicious logic such as network calls, file access, or credential handling. No use of environment variables or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The script defines package metadata and dependencies using obfuscated variable names, then calls setup() with these variables. All data is static, hardcoded, and used solely for package configuration. There are no external inputs, network communications, or suspicious behaviors. The obfuscation seems superficial, perhaps intended to evade straightforward review but does not introduce malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. The code solely configures a package for distribution without performing any harmful actions.",
