{
  "purpose": "This code defines package metadata and configuration for a Python package using distutils, with obfuscated variable names.",
  "sources": "Static data assigned to variables; no external input or dynamic data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or file system operations involving untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from static variables into the setup() call; no external or untrusted data flows involved.",
  "anomalies": "Heavily obfuscated variable names; use of distutils instead of setuptools; static, hardcoded package info.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with superficial obfuscation, static data, and no malicious or suspicious behavior. No external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. Obfuscation appears superficial, likely for deterrence or concealment but does not conceal malicious intent. The malware score is zero, consistent with the static, benign nature. Security risk is minimal, with scores around 0.1, primarily due to obfuscation. The obfuscation score (~0.6) reflects variable name obscurity but does not imply malicious activity. Overall, the code is benign, with superficial obfuscation, and poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static setup script with superficial obfuscation. No evidence of malware or security vulnerabilities is present. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
