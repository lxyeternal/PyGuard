{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging a Python project, defining dependencies and entry points for installation.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata, dependencies, and entry points; no external or untrusted input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "Uses the setup() function to configure package installation; no suspicious sinks or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Standard flow from source definitions to the setup() call with parameters; no untrusted data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are obfuscated or nonsensical, which could be suspicious; however, no malicious code or backdoors are apparent. The hard-coded dependency versions and scripts are typical in setup files.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily constructs package metadata for distribution, including dependencies and entry points. Variable obfuscation appears to be intentionally obscure but not malicious. No code injection, network activity, or secret exfiltration is present. No signs of malicious behavior such as backdoors, data theft, or system damage are evident. The obfuscation of variable names is unusual but not inherently malicious. No external inputs, user data, or untrusted sources are involved.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names but no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears to be a legitimate package configuration file with some obfuscation to hinder readability.",
