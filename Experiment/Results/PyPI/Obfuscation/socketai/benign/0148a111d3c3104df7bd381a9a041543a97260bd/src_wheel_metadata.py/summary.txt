  "conclusion": "The code is largely safe with minimal or no malware detected. The primary concern is cautious handling of functions like 'exec', which could be exploited if misused. Adjusting the security risk score for report 5 to reflect this concern improves accuracy. Overall, the supply chain security posture appears acceptable, with low malware and obfuscation scores and a moderate security risk primarily due to code constructs rather than active malicious payloads."
