{
  "purpose": "Handles import of 'bdist_wheel' from setuptools, raises error if missing, and issues a deprecation warning.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'setuptools.command.bdist_wheel', the exception handling block, and the warn() function call.",
  "sinks": "warn() function outputs warning; exception raises error with message; no untrusted data flow or external effects.",
  "flows": "Attempted import from setuptools → exception handling → raising ImportError with message → issuing warning with message.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated variable names for message string and exception variable; no malicious code or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard import error handling and user warning for deprecated module. Obfuscated variable names are unusual but do not impact functionality or indicate malicious intent. No external data, network activity, or malicious payloads are present. The logic is straightforward and aligns with common deprecation handling practices. The obfuscation appears to be stylistic or to hinder readability but does not constitute malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a compatibility and deprecation warning handler. No malicious activity or security risks are present. The obfuscation is notable but not malicious. The scores should be malware: 0, obfuscated: approximately 0.7, security risk: around 0.1-0.2, reflecting low threat but acknowledging obfuscation.",
