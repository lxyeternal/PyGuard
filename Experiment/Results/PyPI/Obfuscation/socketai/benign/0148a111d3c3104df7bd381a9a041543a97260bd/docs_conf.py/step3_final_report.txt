  "purpose": "Configuration script for Sphinx documentation setup, reading version info from __init__.py.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from a file (__init__.py) using regex; accesses static files for documentation.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or malicious data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from source file; no data flows to external systems or network.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names and a suspiciously named os function (os.dxCqotFLpRtUvhlWkZLwoZSrJNTKfkYP), which may be placeholder or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs static configuration for documentation, with no evidence of malicious activity. Obfuscated variable names and function names are present but likely for concealment or auto-generation. The regex extracts version info safely, and no network or data exfiltration occurs. The suspicious function name warrants caution but does not confirm malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, risk=0.2, obfuscated=0.7) are justified given the obfuscation but lack of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a static configuration script with obfuscated variable names. No malicious activity or vulnerabilities are detected. The obfuscation appears to be for concealment but does not imply malicious intent. The scores are appropriate and should remain as is.",
