  "purpose": "Descriptive configuration instructions involving placeholder variable names for wheel metadata and tags.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as wheel paths, python_tags, abi_tags, platform_tags, build_tag, and remove flag.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data leaks; purely descriptive text.",
  "flows": "Parameters are processed to modify metadata; no data flow indicating malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated or placeholder variable names (e.g., 'icyaHHMbmjBduTYrHeOKaXzVxWNPcilf') and nonsensical strings, suggesting obfuscation or placeholder content.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets are primarily documentation or configuration instructions with obfuscated variable names. No executable logic, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are evident. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not constitute malicious activity. Malware score is zero, consistent with the absence of malicious intent. Security risk scores are very low, reflecting the benign nature of the content. The high obfuscation scores are justified by the placeholder-like naming and nonsensical strings, but do not indicate active threats.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code snippets are benign documentation or configuration instructions with obfuscated placeholders. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The high obfuscation scores are appropriate given the variable naming, but overall, the code is safe. No immediate security concerns are identified.",
