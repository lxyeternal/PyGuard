{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for handling enums, parsing delimited strings into tuples with optional casting, and processing boolean-like configuration values.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include string parameters to functions: enum names, delimited strings, and boolean configuration strings.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or external communication; functions process data locally and raise exceptions on errors.",
  "flows": "Data flows from string inputs through parsing and casting functions, with exception handling on enum lookups.",
  "anomalies": "Functions have obfuscated and lengthy variable names, but no signs of hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious payloads. No unsafe code or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements utility functions for enum lookup with exception handling, flexible string splitting with optional casting, and boolean parsing from strings. The logic appears standard and does not contain obfuscation, malicious behavior, or suspicious data handling. No external network activity, system modification, or malicious data exfiltration is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is benign, serving as utility functions for configuration and enum parsing. No malicious intent or security risks are detected based on this code snippet.",
