  "purpose": "Utility functions for enum parsing, string splitting, and boolean parsing.",
  "sources": "Input strings for enum names, delimited strings for splitting, boolean state strings.",
  "sinks": "No external data flows or system modifications; internal data processing only.",
  "flows": "Input strings are split or parsed, then returned as tuples or enum members; no external sinks involved.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of variable and function names; no malicious code or external data handling detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard utility functions for enum lookup, string splitting, and boolean interpretation. Despite obfuscated naming, the logic is straightforward and safe. No network, file, or system modification operations are present. The functions handle errors appropriately and do not contain malicious payloads. The obfuscation appears cosmetic, not malicious. Malware score is 0, risk score is low (~0.2), and obfuscation score is high (~0.75), consistent across reports. No suspicious data flows or external data leaks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility functions with obfuscated variable names. No malicious activity or security vulnerabilities are detected. The high obfuscation does not imply malicious intent, and the scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
