{
  "purpose": "Import specific variables or constants from a local module named 'config'",
  "sources": "The import statement reads from the module '.config' (relative import)",
  "sinks": "No immediate sinks for untrusted data or security-sensitive operations are present in this code fragment",
  "flows": "No data flow is observable in this isolated import statement; it merely imports variables/constants",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated-looking variable names (e.g., JGmKtkSUOJkMHwlujpHbCEewoPXTxFdB) which may indicate attempts to hide malicious intent or sensitive data",
  "analysis": "The code performs a relative import from a module named 'config'. The imported names are obfuscated, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No execution, network activity, or data processing is present. The obfuscated variable names could suggest concealment, but without further context or code, this cannot be conclusively malicious. The import alone is a standard operation in Python; the obfuscation warrants noting but is not definitive evidence of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code simply imports variables with obfuscated names from a local 'config' module. There is no clear malicious behavior or security risk observable from this single statement. The obfuscated variable names could be benign or intentionally concealed data, but further context is needed for definitive judgment.",
