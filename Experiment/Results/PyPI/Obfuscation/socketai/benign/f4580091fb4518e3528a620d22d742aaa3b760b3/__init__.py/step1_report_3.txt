  "purpose": "Import specific variables or functions from a local config module, likely for configuration or secret management.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing variables from .config module",
  "sinks": "No direct sink observed; no untrusted data handling or external transmission",
  "flows": "Imported variables are used elsewhere in the program, but within this snippet, no data flow is visible",
  "anomalies": "Variable names appear obfuscated or generated, which could be suspicious, but there are no explicit malicious actions or obfuscated code patterns here",
  "analysis": "The code imports four variables from a local module named 'config'. The variable names are lengthy and appear to be obfuscated or randomly generated, which might suggest an attempt to hide sensitive information or prevent easy understanding. However, without additional context, there are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The import itself is standard for configuration management, though the naming convention is unusual. No suspicious functions, network operations, or code execution are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a straightforward import from a local config module with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks based solely on this snippet.",
