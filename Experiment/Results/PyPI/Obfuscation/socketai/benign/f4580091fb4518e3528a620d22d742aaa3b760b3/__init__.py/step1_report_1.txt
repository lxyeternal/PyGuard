{
  "purpose": "Import specific variables or functions from a local module named 'config'.",
  "sources": "The code reads from a relative module import: '.config'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks for untrusted data in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "This code does not include data flows or processing beyond the import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The imported names are long, seemingly random strings, which could indicate obfuscation or secret keys. The code snippet is minimal, with no additional logic or context.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard relative import from the 'config' module, importing four identifiers with unusual, non-descriptive names. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code execution, network access, or data exfiltration. The naming could suggest obfuscation or hiding sensitive data, but no malicious activity can be determined from this fragment alone. The snippet is straightforward and typical for configuration management, with no anomalies in code structure aside from the suspicious variable names.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module import statement with unusually named variables, potentially indicating obfuscation but not inherently malicious. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident in this fragment.",
