  "purpose": "Import specific variables from a local 'config' module, likely for configuration purposes.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads variables from the '.config' module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or sinks are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Variables are imported but not used within this fragment; no data flow is observable.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are long and appear obfuscated or randomly generated, which is suspicious but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple relative import of four variables with obfuscated names from a local module. No code execution, network activity, or data handling is visible. The obfuscated variable names could be used to hide sensitive data or malicious intent, but without further context, this remains speculative. The scores assigned in the reports—malware score of 0, high obfuscation scores (~0.7-0.8), and low security risk (~0.1-0.2)—are consistent with the analysis. No immediate threats are evident, but the obfuscation warrants further review of the 'config' module to ensure no malicious code is concealed.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet is benign in isolation, representing a standard import statement with obfuscated variable names. While the obfuscation raises suspicion, there is no evidence of malicious activity. The current scores are appropriate, but further investigation into the 'config' module is recommended to rule out hidden malicious code.",
