  "purpose": "Import specific variables from a local configuration module.",
  "sources": "Import statement accessing 'config' module to retrieve variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data are present; the code only imports variables.",
  "flows": "Import statement pulls variables from 'config' module into current namespace.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names appear to be obfuscated or random; no clear purpose or standard naming conventions; no apparent malicious code or control flow.",
  "analysis": "The code only consists of an import statement from a local module named 'config'. The imported identifiers are seemingly random strings, which could suggest obfuscation or placeholder variables. There is no evidence of data input, data processing, or any operation that could lead to data leakage or malicious activity. No suspicious behavior such as network calls, code execution, or credential handling is evident. The use of relative import indicates modular design but does not itself indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there is no indication of malicious behavior or security risk. The obfuscated variable names may be intentional but do not constitute malicious activity. Overall, the code appears benign.",
