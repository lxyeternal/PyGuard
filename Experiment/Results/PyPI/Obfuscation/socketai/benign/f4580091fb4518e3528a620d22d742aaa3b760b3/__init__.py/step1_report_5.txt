  "sinks": "No sinks present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows beyond the import statement; variables are imported from a local module.",
  "anomalies": "The variable names are obfuscated and appear as random strings; no clear purpose or naming convention. No other code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports variables with non-descriptive, obfuscated names from a local module. There are no operations, data processing, or function calls. The import alone does not indicate malicious intent but the obfuscated naming raises suspicion. Lack of context makes it difficult to determine the purpose of these variables.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with obfuscated variable names. No malicious behavior or security risks are directly evident from this snippet alone. However, the obfuscated variable names could suggest an attempt to hide sensitive data or functionality. Without additional context, the risk level remains low but warrants further review of the 'config' module.",
