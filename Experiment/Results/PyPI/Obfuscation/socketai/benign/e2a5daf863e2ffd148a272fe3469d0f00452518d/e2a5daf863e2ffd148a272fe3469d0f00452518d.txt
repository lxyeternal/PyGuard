      "conclusion": "The code does not contain active malware or malicious payloads. The primary security concern is the presence of hardcoded secrets and obfuscation, which are poor security practices but not malicious. The overall malware score is 0, with moderate obfuscation and risk scores reflecting the embedded secret and obfuscation practices."

      "obfuscated": 0.85,
      "confidence": 0.85,
      "conclusion": "The code is highly obfuscated and employs techniques commonly associated with malicious modules, such as dynamic code execution and import hijacking. While no direct malicious payload is evident, its capabilities for concealment and manipulation justify a high suspicion of malicious intent. It warrants thorough review and cautious handling before deployment."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, though heavily obfuscated, compatibility test suite for 'six'. It does not exhibit malicious activity or supply chain sabotage. The obfuscation and dynamic features are typical for such testing but should be reviewed cautiously if used in untrusted environments. Overall, the security risk is low, and the malware likelihood is negligible."
