{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package, intended to configure package metadata and installation parameters.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' for long description; importing setup functions; embedded hardcoded string 'qcwzx3yzeo64f62y'; variables assigned with obfuscated names.",
  "sinks": "The embedded secret string 'qcwzx3yzeo64f62y' could be a secret or token; no other untrusted data sources or sinks identified.",
  "flows": "The code reads the README file as input; the secret string is assigned to a setup parameter; no data flows to external systems or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; embedded hardcoded secret 'qcwzx3yzeo64f62y'; malformed 'with open' statement missing parentheses in some reports; suspicious key 'QDTZFWMyGiSVMgwfjqSrkySAtwmLtASe'.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration with obfuscation and embedded secrets. No malicious code, network activity, or backdoors are evident. Syntax errors in some reports suggest poor coding or obfuscation but not malicious intent. The embedded secret poses a security concern if sensitive. Obfuscation complicates understanding but does not inherently indicate malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain active malware or malicious payloads. The primary security concern is the presence of hardcoded secrets and obfuscation, which are poor security practices but not malicious. The overall malware score is 0, with moderate obfuscation and risk scores reflecting the embedded secret and obfuscation practices.",
