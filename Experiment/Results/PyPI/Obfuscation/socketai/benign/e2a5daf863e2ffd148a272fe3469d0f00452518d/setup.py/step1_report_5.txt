  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or dangerous actions detected.",
  "flows": "Reads file content, then passes static metadata to setup().",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names; no obvious malicious activity. Use of 'with open' with a non-standard variable name, but not suspicious per se. The hardcoded 'qcwzx3yzeo64f62y' string appears arbitrary but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python project, with obfuscated or nonsensical variable names. It imports 'setuptools' or 'distutils', reads a README file, and calls setup() with package metadata. No code injection, network activity, or suspicious logic detected. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors. The only unusual aspects are variable names which seem obfuscated but do not indicate malicious intent. There are no flows indicating data exfiltration or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard setup.py file with obfuscated variable names, which could be for code minification or concealment. There is no evidence of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
