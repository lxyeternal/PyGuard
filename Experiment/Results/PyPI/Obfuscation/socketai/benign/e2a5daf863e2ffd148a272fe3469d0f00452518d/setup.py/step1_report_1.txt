  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, used to define package metadata and installation requirements.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data affects system or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Reading file -> storing content -> passing data to setup function.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names with random strings, the use of a hardcoded 'secret' string in setup parameters, and a suspicious 'read' of a file without validation. The hardcoded string 'qcwzx3yzeo64f62y' appears to be a secret or token, possibly sensitive.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names and some questionable hardcoded strings. The 'secret' string in the setup function could be a hardcoded token or key, which is generally discouraged. The code reads a README file for package description, which is typical. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident beyond poor security practice of embedding secrets. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or malicious code observed.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names and a hardcoded secret. There is no direct malicious behavior or malware present, but the hardcoded secret reduces security hygiene and could be exploited if sensitive.",
