  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate data scraping and processing script that employs obfuscation and complex date parsing functions. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or sabotage. The obfuscation appears to be for concealment rather than malicious purposes. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score should be set to 0. The obfuscation score can be considered moderate (~0.6) due to deliberate obfuscation. The security risk score remains low (~0.2)."
