  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'covid19poland' including reading dependencies and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'requirements.txt' for dependencies; reading 'README.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted data directly; the dependencies are loaded from a file, and the description from a README file.",
  "flows": "Reading 'requirements.txt' into 'install_requires' variable; reading 'README.md' into description field; then passing these to setuptools.setup.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are obfuscated or randomly generated, but this is typical in some code obfuscation or code generation contexts. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code are present. No network operations or dynamic code execution are observed.",
  "analysis": "The script attempts to load dependencies from a local 'requirements.txt', with exception handling that defaults to an empty list. It reads the package's README for a description, then calls 'setuptools.setup' with package metadata and configuration, including dependencies, package data, classifiers, and URLs. The code appears standard for a package setup script. No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is evident. The variable names seem intentionally obscure but do not indicate malicious intent. The use of standard libraries and straightforward logic suggest this is a benign setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python package setup script with obfuscated variable names but no malicious or maliciously intended behavior detected. It reads dependencies and description files to configure the package. No security risks or malware indications are present.",
