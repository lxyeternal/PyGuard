{
  "purpose": "Set up a Python package for a COVID-19 data scraper, including reading dependencies and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'requirements.txt' for dependencies, reading 'README.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data handling or insecure data flow observed.",
  "flows": "Dependencies list from 'requirements.txt' passed to 'install_requires', description from 'README.md' used in setup.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names (e.g., hlmZmUNjFjLfgnUZXKkBJTtvmGDnqBDq, NhTEMoaztLSBzuBTuySsxIEnsmCuBTXR) and inconsistent formatting. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup procedures. It reads a requirements file for dependencies and a README file for the long description. The use of obfuscated variable names appears to be a code obfuscation or formatting choice but does not indicate malicious intent. There are no network connections, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors. The data and code flow follow typical setup.py patterns. No malicious behavior or malware patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical setup script for a Python package with obfuscated variable names, likely for code obfuscation or minification reasons. No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident.",
