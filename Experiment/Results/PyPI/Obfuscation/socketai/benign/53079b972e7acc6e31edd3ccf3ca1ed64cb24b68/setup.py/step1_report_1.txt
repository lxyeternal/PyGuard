{
  "purpose": "This code sets up a Python package named 'covid19poland' for distribution, including reading dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads 'requirements.txt' for dependencies, and 'README.md' for the package description.",
  "sinks": "The dependencies are loaded into 'install_requires'; no untrusted data directly influences code execution beyond standard package setup.",
  "flows": "The dependencies from 'requirements.txt' flow into 'install_requires'; the README content flows into the package description field.",
  "anomalies": "The variable names are obfuscated or nonsensical, which is unusual. The exception handling for reading 'requirements.txt' is broad but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns are present. The code appears to perform standard package setup tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to read dependencies from 'requirements.txt' and the description from 'README.md'. It then uses setuptools.setup() to configure the package. Variable names are intentionally obscure, but no malicious or suspicious code is present. There are no signs of backdoors, malicious network activity, or data exfiltration. The broad exception handling is a minor concern but not malicious. Overall, the code is consistent with typical package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard Python package setup with obfuscated variable names, likely for code obfuscation or stylistic reasons. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
