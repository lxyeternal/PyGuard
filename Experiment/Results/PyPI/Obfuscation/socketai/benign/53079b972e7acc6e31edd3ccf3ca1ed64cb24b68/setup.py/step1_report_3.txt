{
  "purpose": "To set up a Python package named 'covid19poland' with dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'requirements.txt' for dependencies, reading 'README.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "Potentially used for dependency installation and package metadata configuration; no untrusted data sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Reading 'requirements.txt' -> dependency list; reading 'README.md' -> long description; then setup process.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names (e.g., hlmZmUNjFjLfgnUZXKkBJTtvmGDnqBDq, NhTEMoaztLSBzuBTuySsxIEnsmCuBTXR), unusual formatting, concatenation of description with variable. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script reads dependencies from 'requirements.txt' and package description from 'README.md', then uses setuptools to configure package setup. Variable names are intentionally obfuscated but serve as standard data holders. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious code behavior present. The code structure appears consistent with typical Python package setup scripts, albeit with unusual variable naming. No evidence of malware, backdoors, or security risks identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a typical setup script for a Python package with obfuscated variable names but no malicious intent or security issues. It appears to be a standard package configuration script with no signs of malware or security risks.",
