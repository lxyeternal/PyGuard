{
  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script that reads dependencies and description files, then configures package metadata using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads 'requirements.txt' for dependencies, 'README.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or environment variable manipulation beyond reading files.",
  "flows": "Input files ('requirements.txt', 'README.md') flow into package configuration; no external data flows or untrusted data execution.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, broad exception handling when reading 'requirements.txt'.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical setup tasks for a Python package, with obfuscated variable names that do not affect functionality. No malicious code, network activity, or data exfiltration is present. Broad exception handling is a minor concern but not malicious. The obfuscation appears stylistic rather than malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with obfuscated variable names. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. The obfuscation is likely stylistic. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is zero.",
