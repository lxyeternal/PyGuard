  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code's core function is to import modules and retrieve the version of the 'covid19poland' package.\n- The variable name used to store the version is consistently obfuscated (`yDRRmcESrmQelIOdMFXsnDGWEBrvUIIR`), which is unusual but not inherently malicious.\n- The code uses broad exception handling without logging, which could hide issues but is common in optional dependency checks.\n- No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are evident in the code snippets.\n\n---\n\n### Issue 1\n**Purpose:** Import modules and get package version  \n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0.2  \n**Risk score:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly identifies that this is a benign, standard operation. The low malware and risk scores are justified. The minor obfuscation is noted but not suspicious enough to raise concern.\n\n---\n\n### Issue 2\n**Purpose:** Same as above, with emphasis on silent exception handling and variable obfuscation.  \n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0.7  \n**Risk score:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe higher obfuscation score reflects the variable name's obscurity. However, the overall operation remains benign. The lack of logging on exceptions is a minor concern but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Issue 3\n**Purpose:** Import local modules and retrieve package version  \n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0.3  \n**Risk score:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, standard dependency check with obfuscated variable name. No malicious activity is suggested.\n\n---\n\n### Issue 4\n**Purpose:** Same as above, straightforward version check  \n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0.3  \n**Risk score:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with previous assessments; no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Issue 5\n**Purpose:** Same operation, noting obfuscation and potential red flags  \n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0.7  \n**Risk score:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe higher obfuscation and slightly increased risk score reflect caution due to variable naming. Still, no evidence of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** Range from 0.2 to 0.7, which is reasonable given the variable naming.\n- **Risk scores:** Mostly 0.1 or 0.2, indicating low security risk, consistent with the code's function.\n\n**Potential issues:**\n- The obfuscation could be intentional to hide purpose or could be a red flag if malicious code were present. However, the code itself is straightforward.\n- The broad exception handling without logging is a minor concern but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores assigned seem appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n- No adjustments needed unless further context reveals malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.3 (consistent with variable naming but not overtly suspicious)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (low, typical for dependency version checks)\n\nThis aligns with the reports' assessments, confirming that the code is benign, with minor obfuscation but no malicious activity.",
