  "sinks": "None explicitly; no untrusted data is used directly in a way that leads to data leaks or execution of untrusted code",
  "flows": "Attempt to get package version (source) and store it in a variable (sink)",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable name 'yDRRmcESrmQelIOdMFXsnDGWEBrvUIIR'; silent exception handling without logging; no other suspicious code or backdoors",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules and attempts to retrieve the version of the 'covid19poland' package using pkg_resources. The variable name is obfuscated, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. The exception handling is broad, silently assigning None if the package is not found, which is typical for optional dependencies or version checks. There is no indication of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The code appears straightforward and benign, though the variable name obscurity could be suspicious in a different context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple package version check with obfuscated variable naming, no malicious or malicious intent evident, and no security risks identified.",
