  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable name 'yDRRmcESrmQelIOdMFXsnDGWEBrvUIIR'; no other suspicious code or secrets",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules and tries to retrieve the version of 'covid19poland' package. The variable name appears intentionally obfuscated, which could be an attempt to hide purpose, but no malicious behavior or backdoors are evident. The try-except block safely handles the case where the package isn't installed. No suspicious code injections or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard package version checking with obfuscated variable naming. No malicious intent or security threats are apparent.",
