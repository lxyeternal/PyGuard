{
  "purpose": "This code appears to import modules and attempt to retrieve the version of the 'covid19poland' package, likely for compatibility or logging purposes.",
  "sources": "Reading the package distribution information via pkg_resources.get_distribution()",
  "sinks": "None present; no data is sent or written to untrusted sources or network endpoints",
  "flows": "Attempt to retrieve package version (source) to a variable (sink) - no malicious flow identified",
  "anomalies": "Use of an obfuscated variable name (yDRRmcESrmQelIOdMFXsnDGWEBrvUIIR) instead of a meaningful identifier; no other unusual code features or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules, which is standard, and attempts to get the version of a specific package. The variable name is intentionally obscure, which may be a minor anomaly, but does not imply malicious intent. The try-except block ensures that failure to find the package does not cause errors, which is common in dependency checks. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign operation typical of package initialization or compatibility checks. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected.",
