  "purpose": "Dependency version check for 'covid19poland' package, using an obfuscated variable name.",
  "sources": "pkg_resources.get_distribution('covid19poland').version within a try-except block.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only reads package info.",
  "flows": "Source: get_distribution call; Sink: assignment to obfuscated variable.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a nonsensical, obfuscated variable name; broad exception handling without logging.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard dependency version retrieval, wrapped in broad exception handling, with an intentionally obfuscated variable name. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. The obfuscation could be an attempt to hide purpose but is not inherently malicious. The exception handling is typical for optional dependencies but could hide issues. Overall, the code is benign, with minimal security concerns, primarily related to obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign dependency check with moderate obfuscation. No malicious activity or security threats are evident. The high obfuscation score reflects the variable naming but does not indicate malicious intent. The overall security risk remains very low.",
