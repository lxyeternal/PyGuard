{
  "purpose": "To import modules and retrieve the version of the 'covid19poland' package if installed.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package distribution information using pkg_resources.get_distribution.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; the version information is stored in a variable, but not used further in this fragment.",
  "flows": "The source is the get_distribution call, which retrieves package metadata, stored in a variable.",
  "anomalies": "The variable name 'yDRRmcESrmQelIOdMFXsnDGWEBrvUIIR' appears obfuscated and unnecessarily complex, which could indicate an attempt to conceal intent. No other suspicious code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules, then attempts to obtain the installed version of a package named 'covid19poland' using pkg_resources. The exception handling suppresses errors if the package is not installed. The variable name is highly obfuscated, which is unusual and could be a sign of malicious intent to hide functionality or intent. There are no network calls, data exfiltration, or malicious actions evident in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily performs a benign operation—checking for a package version—and uses obfuscated variable naming, which raises suspicion but does not demonstrate malicious behavior within this fragment. The overall risk appears low, but obfuscation warrants caution.",
