{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to load, process, and analyze COVID-19 data, specifically related to death cases and testing, with data retrieval from external sources and local JSON files.",
  "sources": "External URLs for Excel files, local CSV and JSON data files, input parameters for functions (city name).",
  "sinks": "Data processing functions that handle loaded data; no direct data leakage or untrusted output manipulation observed.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded from URLs or local files, processed with pandas, and merged for analysis. No untrusted input flows directly into sensitive sinks or system commands.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad exception handling without logging or error reporting, loading external data without validation, and potential for data override in JSON merging, but no hardcoded secrets or suspicious network behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code loads datasets from a specified URL and local resources, processes COVID-19 death and testing data, and provides functions to retrieve data for specific cities and dates. The functions include loading data with error handling, merging datasets, and converting JSON files. No signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, command injection, or backdoors are present. The code does perform network requests and file handling, but all actions appear consistent with data processing tasks. No obfuscation, suspicious dynamic code execution, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily for data collection and analysis of COVID-19 datasets. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware signatures. The broad exception handling and external data loading should be reviewed for robustness, but no malicious or suspicious activities are evident.",
