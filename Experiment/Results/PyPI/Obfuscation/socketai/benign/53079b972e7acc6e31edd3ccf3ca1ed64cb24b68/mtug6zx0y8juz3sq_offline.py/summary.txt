  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate COVID-19 data analysis script with obfuscation that warrants caution but no evidence of malicious activity. The malware score is appropriately 0, the obfuscation score is justified at around 0.75 due to the obfuscated identifiers, and the security risk score remains low at 0.2. No modifications are necessary; the scores are consistent with the observed behavior."
