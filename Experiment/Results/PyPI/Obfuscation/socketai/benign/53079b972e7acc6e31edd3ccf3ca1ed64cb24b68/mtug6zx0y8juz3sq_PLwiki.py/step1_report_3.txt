{
  "purpose": "The code fetches COVID-19 data from Wikipedia and Wayback Machine, processes HTML tables into structured data, and provides functions to retrieve this data based on different levels of data collection.",
  "sources": "Reads HTML content from URLs using BeautifulSoup; fetches data through the WaybackMachine API; reads HTML tables via pandas.read_html from parsed BeautifulSoup objects; processes data within functions",
  "sinks": "Data is processed and returned as pandas DataFrames; no evident data leakage or insecure output. No untrusted input is written to files or network",
  "flows": "Input URLs are fetched via WaybackMachine, parsed with BeautifulSoup, then processed with pandas.read_html; data is transformed, cleaned, and returned as DataFrames",
  "anomalies": "The code includes obfuscated variable names, which is unusual but not malicious; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed; no external or hidden network activity, no system commands executed",
  "analysis": "The script primarily fetches historical web pages from Wikipedia via the WaybackMachine, parses HTML tables, and converts data into structured pandas DataFrames. It applies regular expressions for date parsing and number extraction, which are standard data processing techniques. There is no indication of malicious behavior such as network exfiltration, command execution, or data theft. The obfuscated variable names seem to serve no malicious purpose but could be a sign of code concealment. The functions perform data parsing and transformation only, with no dangerous operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate data collection and processing script focused on COVID-19 data from Wikipedia, with no malicious intent detected. Its obfuscation may suggest attempts at concealment, but no malicious activity is evident. The overall security risk is low.",
