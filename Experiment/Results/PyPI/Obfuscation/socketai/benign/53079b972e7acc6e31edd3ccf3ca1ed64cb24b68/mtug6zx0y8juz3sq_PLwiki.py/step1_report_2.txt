{
  "purpose": "The code fetches COVID-19 related data from Wikipedia using the Wayback Machine and processes it into structured pandas DataFrames.",
  "sources": "Input URLs for Wikipedia pages, HTML content from the Wayback Machine, and data fetched via BeautifulSoup and pandas read_html.",
  "sinks": "Processed data outputs; no direct data sinks that leak untrusted data externally; no network or file system operations beyond data fetching.",
  "flows": "Input URL -> WaybackMachine fetch -> BeautifulSoup parse -> pandas read_html -> DataFrame processing and merging -> return processed DataFrame.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious code patterns; no obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution; no network connections beyond standard data retrieval.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily fetches historical Wikipedia pages about COVID-19 in Poland using the Wayback Machine, parses HTML tables with BeautifulSoup, processes data with pandas, and provides functions to retrieve structured COVID-19 data. No external code injection, data exfiltration, or system manipulation is evident. Functions are designed for data extraction and transformation. No suspicious behavior, such as backdoors, hidden network activity, or malicious data handling, is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign data processing module intended for historical COVID-19 data retrieval. It does not contain malicious intent, backdoors, or malware. It appears to be a standard web scraping and data transformation script with no security risks.",
