{
  "purpose": "Fetches and processes COVID-19 data from Wikipedia's archived pages using Wayback Machine snapshots, parsing HTML tables and converting data into structured pandas DataFrames.",
  "sources": "Reads HTML content from Wayback Machine snapshots, extracts tables, and processes date and numerical data within the code.",
  "sinks": "Data is processed into pandas DataFrames; no external system modifications, network exfiltration, or file writes are evident.",
  "flows": "HTML content fetched from web, parsed with BeautifulSoup, data transformed via pandas, with no external or untrusted data sinks beyond data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, broad silent exception handling, minimal comments, and use of regex for data parsing; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs web scraping of Wikipedia pages via the Wayback Machine, parsing HTML tables into pandas DataFrames, converting date strings with regex and datetime, and transforming data with melt operations. No malicious code, network activity beyond data fetching, or system modifications are present. Obfuscation and silent error handling reduce clarity but do not indicate malicious intent. The code's purpose is benign data collection, with no signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated web scraper for COVID-19 data with no malicious activity detected. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2). Obfuscation is present but not malicious. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
