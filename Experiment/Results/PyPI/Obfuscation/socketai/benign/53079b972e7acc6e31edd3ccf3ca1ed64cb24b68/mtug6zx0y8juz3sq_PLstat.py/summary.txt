  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate data collection and processing script with significant obfuscation likely for concealment. No evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or supply chain compromise was found. The assigned scores are consistent with the static analysis. While obfuscation warrants ongoing caution, the overall security assessment is benign."
