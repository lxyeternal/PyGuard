{
  "purpose": "The code performs data collection and processing of demographic and COVID-19 statistics from official government sources, web scraping, and local resources, then stores the processed data.",
  "sources": "Downloads ZIP files from official Polish government URLs, requests web pages, reads local CSVs, and fetches data via web scraping and APIs.",
  "sinks": "Data is read from URLs and files; processed into pandas DataFrames; saved as CSV files; no untrusted data outputs or external system effects observed.",
  "flows": "Sources (URLs, local files) → Data fetching/parsing functions → Data processing (pandas, BeautifulSoup) → Data storage (CSV files).",
  "anomalies": "Variable and function names are heavily obfuscated; no malicious code, code injection, or network activity indicative of malicious intent; no hardcoded secrets or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard data collection and processing libraries (requests, pandas, zipfile, BeautifulSoup). Obfuscation is significant but appears to serve concealment rather than malicious purposes. No dynamic code execution, malicious payloads, or suspicious network activity are present. The functions fetch data from reputable sources, parse and process it, and store it locally. The obfuscation level is high, which warrants caution, but the code's behavior remains consistent with legitimate data pipelines. The static malware score is appropriately zero; the obfuscation score is high but justified; the security risk score is low, reflecting the benign nature of the data sources and processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate data collection and processing script with significant obfuscation likely for concealment. No evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or supply chain compromise was found. The assigned scores are consistent with the static analysis. While obfuscation warrants ongoing caution, the overall security assessment is benign.",
