  "purpose": "To define package setup information using distutils, including metadata and credentials.",
  "sources": "Input data from hardcoded string and setup() function arguments",
  "sinks": "None directly; no untrusted data output or external network calls observed",
  "flows": "Hardcoded credentials are embedded in the arguments to setup()",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded credential-like strings ('ftctjskipm6g97hj') in setup() arguments",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setup' from distutils.core and defines a descriptive string. It then calls setup() with hardcoded credentials, which could be sensitive information embedded within the package metadata. The credentials appear to be static and not dynamically generated or obfuscated. There are no network calls, code injection, or other suspicious activities. The use of hardcoded secrets in package metadata is a security concern, as it may leak sensitive information or serve as backdoors if maliciously used.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains hardcoded credentials within the setup() arguments, which is a security risk and can be exploited for malicious purposes such as credential theft or unauthorized access. There is no direct malware activity or obfuscated code, but embedding secrets in package metadata is a security concern.",
