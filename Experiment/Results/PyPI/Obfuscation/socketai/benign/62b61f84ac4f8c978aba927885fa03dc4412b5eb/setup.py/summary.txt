  "conclusion": "The code is benign with respect to malicious activity; the main security concern is the embedding of secrets in the setup parameters. There is no evidence of malware, code obfuscation for malicious purposes, or malicious behavior. The scores should reflect no malware (0), minimal obfuscation (around 0.2), and a moderate security risk (around 0.4) due to embedded secrets."
