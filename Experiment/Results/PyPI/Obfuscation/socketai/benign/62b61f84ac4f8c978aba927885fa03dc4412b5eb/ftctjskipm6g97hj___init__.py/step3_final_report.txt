{
  "purpose": "Module setup importing obfuscated functions and defining export list",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.file and .hash), reading identifiers and variables",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external communication present",
  "flows": "Imported functions and variables are assigned but not used within this snippet; no data flow to external systems",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function and variable names, undefined exports in __all__",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions with nonsensical names, defines a list, and sets an export list referencing identifiers not present in the snippet. No malicious activity such as network calls, file operations, or data exfiltration is visible. The obfuscation suggests concealment but does not confirm malicious intent. The undefined exports imply they are defined elsewhere. The low malware and security risk scores across reports align with the absence of active threats, though obfuscation warrants caution. The code appears benign but warrants further review of imported modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a module setup with obfuscated identifiers, which raises suspicion but shows no evidence of malicious activity. The low malware and risk scores are appropriate. Further inspection of imported modules is recommended to confirm their safety.",
