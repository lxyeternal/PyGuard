  "purpose": "Cryptographic hash verification and testing using pyscrypt with obfuscated parameters and code structure.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded cryptographic parameters, obfuscated variable names, fallback import functions, and dead code blocks.",
  "sinks": "Hash computation outputs, print statements, and comparison results; no external data flows or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input data (hardcoded) flows into hash functions, results are stored and compared, then printed.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, dead code under 'if False', undefined variable references, complex large hex strings, and fallback functions for hex encoding.",
  "analysis": "The code performs cryptographic hashing for verification purposes, with significant obfuscation tactics such as complex variable names, dead code, and conditional blocks that are never executed. No network, file, or system modification activities are present. The obfuscation appears intentional, possibly to hinder analysis, but there is no evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, or sabotage. The code's primary function seems to be cryptographic validation or testing, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign cryptographic verification/test code with obfuscation. While the obfuscation raises suspicion, there are no signs of malicious intent or malicious payloads. The supply chain security risk is low, but obfuscation should be reviewed in the broader context.",
