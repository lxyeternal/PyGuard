  "conclusion": "The code is primarily a testing suite for r2pipe with obfuscated identifiers and complex command strings. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, payloads, or supply chain sabotage. The obfuscation is likely for concealment or testing purposes rather than malicious intent. The scores should reflect a very low malware likelihood, moderate obfuscation, and low overall security risk."
