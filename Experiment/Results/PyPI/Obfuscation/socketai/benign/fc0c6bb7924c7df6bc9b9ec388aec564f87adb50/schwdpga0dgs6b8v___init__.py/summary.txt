  "conclusion": "The code does not contain active malware or malicious payloads but exhibits behaviors—such as process control, network communication, and minimal input validation—that could be exploited if environment variables or inputs are compromised. The overall security risk is moderate. The current scores of malware (0.1), obfuscation (0.4), and risk (0.45) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior."
