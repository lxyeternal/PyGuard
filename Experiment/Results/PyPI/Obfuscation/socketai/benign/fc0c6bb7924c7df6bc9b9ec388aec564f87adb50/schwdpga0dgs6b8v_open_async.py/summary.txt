  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for remote process and network interaction, possibly for reverse engineering or debugging purposes. It does not contain explicit malware or malicious payloads but has a high degree of obfuscation and flexible network handling, which could be misused in untrusted environments. The overall security risk is moderate, and the malware likelihood is low."
