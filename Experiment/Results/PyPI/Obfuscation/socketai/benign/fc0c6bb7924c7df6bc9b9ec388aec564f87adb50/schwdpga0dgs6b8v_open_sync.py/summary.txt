  "conclusion": "The code exhibits significant obfuscation and capabilities for remote command execution, data exfiltration, and covert communication. While no explicit malicious payloads are present, its structure and features support potential malicious use. The high obfuscation and network/subprocess control features justify a high suspicion level, warranting caution when included as a dependency."
