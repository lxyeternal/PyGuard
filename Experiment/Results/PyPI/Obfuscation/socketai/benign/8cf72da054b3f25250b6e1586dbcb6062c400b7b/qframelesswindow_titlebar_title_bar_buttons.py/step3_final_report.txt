  "purpose": "Parameter definitions and documentation for GUI styling and components, including color, icon path, and state parameters.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'state', 'color', 'iconPath', and 'parent' widget references.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing, network transmission, or external data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows into UI component configurations; no malicious or insecure data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "Repeated parameter blocks with inconsistent formatting; presence of a nonsensical variable name 'IYGUttJwoudBqJCaOSQkEGzsqwORPVkW' and placeholder-like strings suggest obfuscation or code generation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of parameter definitions and docstrings related to GUI elements. No executable logic, data processing, or network activity is present. The unusual variable name and repeated blocks indicate obfuscation or auto-generated code, but there is no evidence of malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, low security risk, moderate obfuscation) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code. The obfuscation appears to be due to placeholder or generated code rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as UI parameter documentation, with no malicious activity or security vulnerabilities detected. The obfuscation is likely due to code generation or placeholders, not malicious sabotage.",
