{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define function docstrings related to window handling, display, and input events, likely for a GUI application or library.",
  "sources": "Parameters such as hWnd, dpiScale, x, y, window, globalPos, and edges are sources of input data, typically from user interactions or system calls.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain explicit sinks that process untrusted data in a way that would lead to security vulnerabilities. It mainly documents parameters and return values.",
  "flows": "Input parameters like hWnd and globalPos flow into GUI functions that handle window states and mouse events, but no direct data flow or untrusted data processing is evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of docstring comments and parameter descriptions, with no executable or malicious code, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is purely descriptive documentation with no implementation, control flow, or code execution. It references system handles, window positions, and GUI events typical of GUI programming, without any embedded or executable code that could be malicious. There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The structure and content suggest it is part of a GUI library or interface documentation, not an executable malicious payload.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as documentation for GUI-related functions and parameters. It contains no malicious code, no suspicious behavior, and no security risks are evident from this snippet.",
