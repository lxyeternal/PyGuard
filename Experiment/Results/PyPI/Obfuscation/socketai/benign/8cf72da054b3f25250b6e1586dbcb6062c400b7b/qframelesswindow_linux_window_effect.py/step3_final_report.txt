  "purpose": "The code consists solely of parameter documentation blocks related to window handle and visual effect parameters, with no executable logic or data processing.",
  "sources": "Parameter definitions and docstrings within the code, primarily involving 'hWnd' and visual effect options.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or external data handling are present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows exist; the code is purely descriptive.",
  "anomalies": "Repetitive parameter documentation without any executable code or logic; no suspicious patterns or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The provided code snippets are exclusively documentation comments describing parameters for window effects and styles. There is no executable code, data processing, or external communication. No signs of malicious activity, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are present. The repeated parameter descriptions suggest auto-generation or incomplete snippets but do not indicate malicious intent. The malware score is appropriately set to 0, as there is no evidence of malicious behavior. The obfuscated score is 0, given the straightforward documentation. The security risk score is 0, as no vulnerabilities or malicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely documentation with no executable logic or malicious content. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are accurate and appropriate. There is no indication of supply chain security issues or malicious activity based on the provided snippets.",
