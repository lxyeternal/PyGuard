{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define multiple parameter documentation blocks for functions related to window handling and visual effects, such as shadows, dark mode, and animations.",
  "sources": "No actual data sources or input reading operations are present; only parameter definitions and documentation comments.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, untrusted data processing, or output operations are present; the code only specifies function parameters.",
  "flows": "No data flows, input-to-output paths, or untrusted data processing flows are present; it is purely parameter documentation.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains repetitive parameter blocks with identical 'hWnd' parameters, and no actual executable logic or data handling. No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of multiple parameter documentation blocks, possibly extracted or duplicated, describing parameters for window-related functions. There are no function implementations, data processing, or security-sensitive operations. Without any logic or data handling, there are no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The repeated parameter descriptions could indicate code generation or incomplete code, but do not raise security concerns by themselves.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely documentation of function parameters without any executable logic. There are no malicious behaviors, security issues, or suspicious patterns present. The code appears safe, with no evidence of supply chain attacks or malware.",
