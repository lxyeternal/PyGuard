  "purpose": "Documentation for GUI event handling parameters, including window, global position, edges, and return color.",
  "sources": "Parameter annotations and comments within the code, primarily static documentation blocks.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; purely descriptive comments with no data flow.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code contains only parameter descriptions without executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "Repeated 'Parameters' blocks indicating formatting or copy-paste errors; no malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of parameter documentation comments for a GUI function, with no executable code or data processing. The repeated blocks are formatting issues, not security concerns. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, risk: 0.1) are appropriate given the benign nature. The high confidence scores reflect the clear documentation status. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely documentation for GUI parameters, with no malicious or security issues. The duplicated 'Parameters' blocks are formatting errors, not indicators of malicious activity. The existing scores are justified and accurate.",
