{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define parameter documentation for a function related to mouse event handling in a GUI application, likely for customizing window appearance or behavior.",
  "sources": "No explicit data sources or input reading mechanisms are present in this fragment.",
  "sinks": "No data is being written or transmitted; no sinks are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no data flow paths since this code only contains parameter descriptions and return type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "Redundant duplicate parameter documentation blocks; no suspicious or unusual code constructs, no hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution found.",
  "analysis": "The code fragment consists solely of documentation comments specifying parameters and return values for a GUI function. There are no executable statements, data processing, or data flows. It appears to be a standard docstring or comment block outlining expected inputs and outputs for a function, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward documentation block describing a GUI-related function. It does not contain executable code, does not perform any data handling, and shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
