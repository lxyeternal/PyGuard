  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n\n- All five reports identify that the code snippets are purely documentation or parameter annotations related to GUI event handling, specifically mouse release events and window edges, with return values like accent colors.\n- They consistently note that the code is duplicated or formatted incorrectly, likely due to copy-paste errors.\n- No report finds any executable code, data processing, or actual logic that could be malicious.\n- All reports assign very high confidence (0.9 or 1.0) that the code is benign, with no obfuscation, malware, or security risks detected.\n- The malware scores are all zero, and the security risk scores are very low (mostly 0 or 0.1).\n\n**Confirmations and Observations:**\n\n- The original code appears to be a fragment of a function's documentation or type annotations, not actual executable code.\n- No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors.\n- The repeated 'Parameters' block is a formatting issue, not an indicator of malicious activity.\n\n**Assessment of Scores:**\n\n- The malware scores are appropriately zero, given the absence of any malicious indicators.\n- The security risk scores are also appropriately low, reflecting that these are benign documentation snippets.\n- The high confidence scores are justified based on the analysis.\n\n**Potential Concerns:**\n\n- The only anomaly is the duplicated parameter documentation, which is likely a formatting mistake rather than malicious activity.\n- No claims or evidence suggest any vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n\n- The current scores are reasonable and align with the analysis.\n- No adjustments needed for malware or security risk scores.\n- Given the evidence, the overall risk posed by this code snippet is negligible.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, mostly due to formatting issues, not security concern)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is a benign, standard documentation fragment for GUI event handling. It poses no security risks or malware concerns. The duplicated parameter blocks are formatting errors and do not indicate malicious intent.\n\n**Final note:** Always ensure such documentation is cleaned up to prevent confusion, but it does not impact security.",
