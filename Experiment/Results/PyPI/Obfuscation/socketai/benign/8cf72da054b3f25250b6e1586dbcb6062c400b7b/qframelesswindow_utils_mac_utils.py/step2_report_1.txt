  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is purely documentation, with no executable logic, data processing, or network activity.\n- No untrusted data sources, sinks, or flows are present.\n- Repetitive parameter documentation appears to be a formatting or copy-paste artifact, not malicious.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with their findings.\n- The security risk scores are all 0, indicating no identified vulnerabilities.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code snippets are just parameter and return value descriptions, likely for GUI event handling functions in PyQt/PySide.\n- No evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or security issues.\n- The duplicated parameter blocks do not suggest malicious behavior but rather a formatting issue.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- Malware: consistently 0 across all reports, which seems appropriate given the analysis.\n- Obfuscated: 0, as no obfuscation is detected.\n- Risk: 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The documentation is benign, with no security concerns.\n- No adjustments needed to the scores based on the provided information.\n\n**My assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the nature of the code snippet.\n\n**Final note:** Since the code is purely documentation with no executable or data handling elements, there is no reason to assign any higher scores. The current scores are justified and appropriate.",
