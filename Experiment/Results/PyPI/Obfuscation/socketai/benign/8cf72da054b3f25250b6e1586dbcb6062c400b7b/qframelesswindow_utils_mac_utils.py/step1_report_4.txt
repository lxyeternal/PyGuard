  "anomalies": "Repetitive parameter documentation; appears to be duplicated or redundant, possibly an error in formatting. No malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a fragment of parameter documentation, likely for a GUI function. It contains repeated parameter descriptions and a return statement. There are no executable code statements, no data processing, no input handling, and no suspicious logic. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is simply a documentation fragment describing parameters and return value for a GUI-related function. There is no malicious behavior, no suspicious activity, and no security concerns based on this snippet.",
