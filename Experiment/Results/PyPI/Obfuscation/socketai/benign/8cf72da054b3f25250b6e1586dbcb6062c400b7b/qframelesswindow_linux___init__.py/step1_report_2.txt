  "purpose": "Definition of parameters for a function or method, likely related to UI customization or layout.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'titleBar' and 'size' documentation comments.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks identified; code is just parameter documentation.",
  "flows": "No actual code logic present, only parameter annotations and comments.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a suspicious string 'gTECNFPzAHJVDgzJLSWmDoZsuwRpeQGa' assigned or associated with 'titleBar', which appears random and potentially malicious if used as an identifier or token.",
  "analysis": "The code fragment contains parameter documentation for 'titleBar' and 'size' with no functional logic. The string associated with 'titleBar' looks arbitrary and may indicate a hardcoded token or identifier, which could be suspicious if used improperly. Since the code lacks context or actual implementation, it's difficult to determine intent definitively. No clear malicious behavior is evident, but the unusual string warrants further review in the larger code context.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet appears to be only documentation with an anomalous string associated with the 'titleBar' parameter. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks within this fragment itself, but the presence of a random string should be further investigated if used in the actual code logic.",
