{
  "purpose": "The code implements a custom title bar with window control buttons (minimize, maximize, close), icon and title display, and handles window events such as state changes and icon updates.",
  "sources": "User interactions triggering window control methods, window event filters, icon change signals.",
  "sinks": "Window methods (showMinimized, showNormal, showMaximized, close), icon updates, window event handling.",
  "flows": "User clicks on buttons -> triggers window control methods; window events -> update button states or icon.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names, but no malicious code, hardcoded secrets, network activity, or suspicious external connections detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard custom title bar for a PySide6 application, with obfuscation likely for code protection or minification. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration are present. The obfuscation is superficial and does not indicate malicious intent. The functions invoked are typical for window management, and no external network activity or credential handling is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate GUI component with obfuscation, not malicious. The assigned scores in the reports are appropriate. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is moderate (~0.4-0.5), and overall security risk is low (~0.2). No further action is necessary.",
