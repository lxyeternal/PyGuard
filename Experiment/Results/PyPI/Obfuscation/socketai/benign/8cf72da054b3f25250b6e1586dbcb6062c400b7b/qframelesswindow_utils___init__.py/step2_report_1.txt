  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as purely documentation or parameter descriptions for GUI-related functions.\n- No executable code, data processing, or data input/output is present.\n- Repetition of parameter descriptions appears to be a copy-paste or formatting issue, not malicious.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malware, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n- The malware scores are all zero, which aligns with the content being non-executable documentation.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is only descriptive comments or docstrings.\n- The repeated parameter descriptions are minor anomalies, likely unintentional, not malicious.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1, with one at 0.9), which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the content.\n- No report suggests any suspicious activity or security risk beyond documentation.\n\n**Scores evaluation:**\n- Malware scores are all 0, which is consistent with the absence of malicious code.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, which is correct since no obfuscation is evident.\n- Security risk scores are 0, as there are no security concerns in documentation-only code.\n\n**Justification for risk scores:**\n- Since the code is only documentation, the risk scores should remain at 0.\n- No reason exists to assign higher scores based on the provided information.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- All reports are accurate in their assessment.\n- The documentation is benign, with no malicious or security issues.\n- The minor duplication is a documentation artifact, not a security concern.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis above.",
