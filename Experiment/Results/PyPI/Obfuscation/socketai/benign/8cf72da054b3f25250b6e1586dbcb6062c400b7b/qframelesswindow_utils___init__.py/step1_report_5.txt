  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or processing are evident.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data transfer is apparent.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be duplicated parameter documentation; no unusual or malicious code structures or secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The provided code consists solely of parameter documentation comments for a function, describing the parameters such as window, globalPos, and edges. There is no executable code, input handling, or data processing. The duplication of parameter descriptions suggests a copy-paste artifact, but it does not indicate malicious intent. The content is standard for GUI event handling and contains no suspicious behavior or obfuscated elements.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely documentation for GUI function parameters with no executable logic or malicious indicators. It poses no security risks and appears to be standard descriptive comments.",
