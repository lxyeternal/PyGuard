  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or data leaks are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink, as this is purely a descriptive comment.",
  "anomalies": "Redundant repetition of the same parameter descriptions; no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is a documentation or docstring segment describing parameters for a function. It repeats the same parameter descriptions twice, which suggests possible copy-paste redundancy but not malicious intent. There are no code execution, data handling, or security-sensitive operations present. It does not contain any obfuscated code, external input processing, or potentially harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a straightforward docstring describing function parameters, with no malicious or security risks detected. The repetition appears to be an oversight rather than malicious behavior.",
