  "purpose": "Documentation of GUI event parameters, specifically for mouse release events and window interactions.",
  "sources": "Parameter descriptions in docstrings or comments.",
  "sinks": "None; purely descriptive comments with no data input/output or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only parameter descriptions without executable code.",
  "anomalies": "Repetition of parameter descriptions, likely formatting or copy-paste artifacts.",
  "analysis": "The provided code consists solely of parameter documentation comments for GUI functions. No executable code, data processing, or network activity is present. The repetition of parameter descriptions is minor and likely unintentional. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are evident. Malware scores are appropriately set to 0, and security risk scores are also 0, reflecting the benign nature of the content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely documentation with no malicious or security concerns. The minor duplication is a formatting issue, not a security risk. All reports correctly assess the benign nature of the code, and the scoring aligns with this assessment.",
