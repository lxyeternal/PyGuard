  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, dynamic code execution, input/output functions, hardcoded secrets, network/file sinks.",
  "sinks": "Potential data exfiltration points, system modifications, network connections, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (environment variables, user input) to sinks (network, file system, environment), possibly via dynamic execution or obfuscated code.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation (score 0.8), signs of dynamic execution, complex control flow, minimal comments, potential use of environment variables.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits significant obfuscation and signs of dynamic execution, which are common in malicious scripts. The high obfuscation score (0.8) aligns with the suspicion. The malware score (0.4) is moderate, reflecting potential risk but no confirmed malicious payloads. The security risk score (0.6) is justified given the obfuscation and dynamic features. Other reports show minimal or benign code with low scores, consistent with their descriptions. The primary concern is the high obfuscation and signs of dynamic execution in the main report, warranting a slightly higher malware risk estimate if further evidence confirms malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The main code exhibits high obfuscation and signs of dynamic execution, indicating a moderate to high suspicion of malicious behavior. Scores are generally consistent with the analysis, with a recommendation to consider increasing the malware score slightly if further evidence of malicious payloads is found. Overall, the dependency shows potential risks primarily due to obfuscation and dynamic features, but lacks concrete malicious payloads at this stage.",
