  "conclusion": "The main code exhibits high obfuscation and signs of dynamic execution, indicating a moderate to high suspicion of malicious behavior. Scores are generally consistent with the analysis, with a recommendation to consider increasing the malware score slightly if further evidence of malicious payloads is found. Overall, the dependency shows potential risks primarily due to obfuscation and dynamic features, but lacks concrete malicious payloads at this stage."
