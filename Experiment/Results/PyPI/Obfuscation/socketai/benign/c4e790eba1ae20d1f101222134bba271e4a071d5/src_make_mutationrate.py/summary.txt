  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential due to eval()/exec() with untrusted data, obfuscation, and hardcoded secrets, warranting a high malware score. Other snippets are benign. The overall assessment confirms significant threat in the suspicious code, with scores aligned to observed behaviors."
