  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Use of eval()/exec() with untrusted data, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, dynamic code execution, network/file operations.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic code execution, network connections, file modifications, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as untrusted input or hardcoded secrets flow into eval()/exec() or network functions, leading to potential malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval()/exec() with untrusted data, high obfuscation levels, hardcoded secrets, suspicious dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code contains eval()/exec() with untrusted input, indicating high malicious potential. Obfuscation techniques are present, and hardcoded secrets suggest malicious intent. No benign patterns or standard data handling are observed. The high malware score (0.75), obfuscation score (0.8), and risk score (0.8) are justified by these behaviors. Other code snippets are benign, with no suspicious activity or obfuscation, reflected in low scores. The confidence level (0.85) is high due to clear indicators of malicious behavior in the suspicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential due to eval()/exec() with untrusted data, obfuscation, and hardcoded secrets, warranting a high malware score. Other snippets are benign. The overall assessment confirms significant threat in the suspicious code, with scores aligned to observed behaviors.",
