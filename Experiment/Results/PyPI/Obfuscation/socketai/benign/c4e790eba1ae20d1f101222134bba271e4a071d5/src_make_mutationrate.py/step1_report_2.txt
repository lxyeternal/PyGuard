  "purpose": "This source code appears to be a Python module intended for general utility functions, possibly related to data processing or application logic.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from standard input (e.g., user input or piped data), environment variables, and external modules. It also imports third-party libraries.",
  "sinks": "The code writes output to standard output, log files, or external systems. Potential sinks include network connections or file operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions, possibly involving environment variables or external modules, and then outputs or network sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets detected. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution. The code structure is straightforward, with no unusual variable names or code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with standard imports and utility functions. It reads input and environment variables, then processes the data accordingly. Usage of third-party modules appears legitimate. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. The code does not perform any network connections, file deletions, or system modifications that are suspicious. It mainly focuses on data handling with no malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indicators of malicious behavior, malware, or significant security risks. The code appears benign, with no suspicious data flows or anomalies observed.",
