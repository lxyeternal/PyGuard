  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as utility or test functions with obfuscated naming. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not imply malicious intent. Overall, the security risk is low, and the malware score should remain near zero."
