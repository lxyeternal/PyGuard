  "purpose": "Provides functions for length-prefixed JSON message framing over binary streams, suitable for IPC or network communication.",
  "sources": "Reads 4-byte length prefix from sys.stdin.buffer, then reads that many bytes for JSON data.",
  "sinks": "Writes length and JSON content bytes to sys.stdout.buffer.",
  "flows": "Input: sys.stdin.buffer.read -> JSON decoding; Output: JSON encoding -> sys.stdout.buffer.write.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code reads a 4-byte length, unpacks it, reads that many bytes, decodes as UTF-8, and loads JSON. Conversely, it serializes JSON, prefixes with length, and writes to stdout. It uses standard libraries with no obfuscation or malicious logic. No network activity or security risks are evident. The functions are straightforward, serving as message framing utilities for IPC or network protocols.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of length-prefixed JSON message framing. No malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, low security risk) are accurate and justified.",
