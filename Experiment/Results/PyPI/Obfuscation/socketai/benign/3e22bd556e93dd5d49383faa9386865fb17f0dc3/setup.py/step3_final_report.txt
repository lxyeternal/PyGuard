  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for a Python package, reading 'README.md' and calling setuptools.setup() with package metadata.",

  "sinks": "setuptools.setup() function, which processes package metadata",
  "flows": "Reading file into variable -> passing variables to setup()",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, inconsistent syntax (e.g., '=' instead of ':' in dictionary), unusual variable naming",
  "analysis": "The code reads a README file into a variable with an obfuscated name, then calls setuptools.setup() with package info. No malicious code, network activity, or external communication is present. Variable obfuscation and syntax irregularities are likely superficial and intended for concealment but do not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious payloads are detected. The obfuscation is superficial and does not impact functionality. The malware score is zero, and the security risk is minimal. The obfuscation score is moderate due to variable naming but not malicious. Overall, the code is benign, serving as a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with obfuscated variable names and irregular syntax but no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation appears superficial, and the code performs standard package setup tasks without malicious intent.",
