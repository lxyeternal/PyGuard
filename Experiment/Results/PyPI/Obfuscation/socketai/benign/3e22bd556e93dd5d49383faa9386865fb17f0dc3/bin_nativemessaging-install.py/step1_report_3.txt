  "purpose": "This script manages browser native messaging host manifests and registry entries for Chrome and Firefox, creating shortcuts and configuration files to facilitate communication between browsers and native applications.",
  "sources": "Reads manifest files from user-specified paths or default files (native-manifest.json), and reads/writes registry keys on Windows; reads and writes files (manifest, batch files, JSON configs).",
  "sinks": "Writes to registry keys (potential system configuration modification), writes manifest JSON files, creates batch files on Windows, modifies local files (including manifest and config files).",
  "flows": "Reads manifest data from files (sources), then writes or modifies registry entries, manifest files, batch files, and JSON configs (sinks), following user input and manifest data.",
  "anomalies": "The code generates batch files for Windows, modifies registry entries, and manipulates browser-specific manifest files without clear user interaction beyond initial input. It also dynamically constructs paths and filenames. No hardcoded credentials or obvious backdoors detected. The script’s intent appears to facilitate native messaging configuration, which could be misused if manipulated maliciously, but as-is, it appears aligned with legitimate setup tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily reads manifest files, adjusts paths, and creates configuration entries for browsers on Windows, Linux, and macOS. It creates batch files for Windows to launch Python scripts, and writes browser-specific manifest JSON files, possibly removing certain keys for Chrome or Firefox. Registry keys are set under HKEY_CURRENT_USER, which is common for user-specific configuration. The code does not contain any network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoor behaviors. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious obfuscation are present. The code’s behavior aligns with legitimate native messaging setup procedures, with no clear malicious intent. Its operations could be repurposed maliciously if manipulated, but the current code does not exhibit malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This script performs standard configuration tasks for browser native messaging, including file and registry modifications. There are no indications of malware or malicious activity. The operations are consistent with legitimate setup processes, but misuse could be possible if manipulated. Overall, the code appears benign and intended for normal configuration purposes.",
