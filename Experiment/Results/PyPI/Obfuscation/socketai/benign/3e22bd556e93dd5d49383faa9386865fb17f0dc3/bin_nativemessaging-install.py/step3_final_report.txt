{
  "purpose": "Manage browser native messaging manifests and registry entries for Chrome and Firefox, facilitating configuration via manifest files and system registry.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments, environment variables, and manifest files read from disk.",
  "sinks": "Writes manifest JSON files, creates registry keys on Windows, and generates batch files for execution.",
  "flows": "Reads manifest files, modifies paths and configurations, writes updated manifests, creates registry entries, and batch scripts depending on platform.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, platform-specific code, creation of batch files, and modifications to system configuration files.",
  "analysis": "The code performs legitimate configuration tasks for browser native messaging, including reading manifests, updating paths, creating registry keys on Windows, and generating configuration files on Linux/macOS. Obfuscated variable names hinder readability but do not indicate malicious intent. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code is present. The script's functions could be misused if supplied with malicious manifests, but the code itself is benign. The obfuscation is superficial, and the operations are standard for setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate utility for configuring browser native messaging hosts, with superficial obfuscation. No evidence of malicious behavior or payloads is detected. The low malware and security risk scores are justified, though obfuscation warrants cautious review.",
