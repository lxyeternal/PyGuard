  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Potential data inputs such as environment variables, user inputs, network connections, file reads, dynamic code execution points.",
  "sinks": "Network transmissions, file modifications, environment variable access, dynamic code execution functions (exec/eval), system commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources like user input or environment variables to sinks such as network or file operations, possibly via intermediate functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns detected. No unusual code structures or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets are either absent or limited, with no evidence of malicious behavior. In reports with some code, patterns are benign, standard, and lack suspicious indicators. Confidence levels are appropriately assigned based on available information. Malware scores are zero, obfuscation scores are zero, and security risk scores are low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal concern. No anomalies or malicious activities are identified, and the reasoning aligns with the evidence.",
  "conclusion": "The provided reports are consistent and accurate given the limited or absent code. All indicate low likelihood of malicious activity, with scores appropriately reflecting the benign assessment. Minor adjustments to risk scores could be considered if more code or runtime data were available, but current scores are justified.",
