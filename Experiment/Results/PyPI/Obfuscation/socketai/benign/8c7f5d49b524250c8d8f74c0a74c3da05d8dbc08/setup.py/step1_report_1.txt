{
  "purpose": "To set up a Python package using setuptools, reading a README file and specifying package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "File reading from './README.rst' to load package description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or output operations detected.",
  "flows": "Read from file → use in setup function; no flow of untrusted data to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names, obfuscated or randomly generated names (e.g., akbUOWiqzfFIszKrJsDoZSvayeVsIyCM). The code appears intentionally obfuscated or generated to obscure intent, but no malicious operations are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and reads a README file to include as the long description. The setup() call specifies package metadata, dependencies, classifiers, and configuration options. Variable names are non-descriptive, which might indicate obfuscation or generated code, but no malicious behavior, such as network connections, data exfiltration, or code injection, is present. No suspicious or malicious code constructs are detected. The code is consistent with typical setup scripts but with unusually named variables.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs a standard package setup with obfuscated variable names but contains no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. The obfuscation appears superficial and does not impact security.",
