  "purpose": "Unit tests for JSON include and build functions, verifying JSON data loaded from files matches expected strings.",
  "sources": "JSON files in './tests/unit/fixtures' directory, read via functions from 'json_include' module.",
  "sinks": "Comparison assertions; no external data leakage or network activity.",
  "flows": "File reads to JSON parsing to data comparison.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated function names; no other suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward unit testing by loading JSON fixtures and comparing to hardcoded expected JSON strings. No network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration is evident. The obfuscated function names are unusual but not inherently malicious; they may hinder code clarity but do not imply malicious intent. The reliance on external files is typical for tests. The functions' internal implementations are unknown, which introduces some uncertainty, but the overall pattern suggests benign testing code. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores from reports align with this assessment, assigning malware scores of 0, low security risk, and high confidence in safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign unit testing script loading JSON fixtures and comparing data. No malicious activity, data leaks, or vulnerabilities are detected. The obfuscation of function names is a concern for clarity but not security. Overall, the code is safe with very low security risk.",
