  "purpose": "Unit testing for JSON inclusion and building functions using the json_include module.",
  "sources": "Reading JSON files from the filesystem ('./tests/unit/fixtures')",
  "sinks": "Comparison with expected JSON strings using assertEqual; no data leaks or external effects observed",
  "flows": "File read operations -> JSON parsing functions -> assertion checks",
  "anomalies": "Use of external JSON files; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code observed; no unusual dynamic code execution",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard unit testing procedures, loading JSON files via json_include functions, then comparing parsed output to expected JSON strings defined within the test. The JSON strings are static, hardcoded in the test for comparison. No suspicious code patterns, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident. The code relies on the json_include module for reading and possibly parsing JSON, but without inspecting that module, no malicious activity can be inferred from its usage here. No network activity, code injection, or credential handling is present. Overall, the code is straightforward, focused on verifying JSON content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard unit testing code with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It reads JSON files, compares their contents to expected strings, and performs assertions. No anomalies, malware, or security threats are identified.",
