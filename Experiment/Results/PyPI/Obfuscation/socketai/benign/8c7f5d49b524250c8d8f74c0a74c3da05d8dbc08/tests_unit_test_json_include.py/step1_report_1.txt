  "purpose": "Unit tests for JSON include and build functions in the json_include module, verifying JSON file reading and inclusion.",
  "sources": "File paths './tests/unit/fixtures' and filenames 'simple_example.json', 'import_example.json'; data read from these JSON files.",
  "sinks": "Comparison assertions of JSON data; no direct data leakage or external untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Reading JSON files via json_include functions, comparing the returned JSON strings with expected dedented JSON strings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. Usage of import and file reading is standard. The function calls appear legitimate.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a unittest TestCase class with two test methods. Each method loads JSON data from specified files using functions from the json_include module. The loaded JSON data is compared to hardcoded JSON strings using assertEqual. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious injections, or data exfiltration. The JSON files are assumed to be local test fixtures. No network activity, environment variable misuse, or dangerous code constructs are present. The code appears to be straightforward unit tests designed to validate JSON reading and inclusion functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test suite for verifying JSON inclusion functions. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. It appears safe and intended for testing purposes.",
