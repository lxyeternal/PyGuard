      "conclusion": "The code is a complex, obfuscated schema/configuration processing utility with no direct signs of malware or malicious payloads. Its recursive include and extension mechanisms, combined with dynamic file handling, pose moderate security risks if used with untrusted data. Proper validation and sanitization are recommended before deployment in sensitive environments."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign unit testing script loading JSON fixtures and comparing data. No malicious activity, data leaks, or vulnerabilities are detected. The obfuscation of function names is a concern for clarity but not security. Overall, the code is safe with very low security risk."

      "conclusion": "The provided reports are consistent and accurate given the limited or absent code. All indicate low likelihood of malicious activity, with scores appropriately reflecting the benign assessment. Minor adjustments to risk scores could be considered if more code or runtime data were available, but current scores are justified."
