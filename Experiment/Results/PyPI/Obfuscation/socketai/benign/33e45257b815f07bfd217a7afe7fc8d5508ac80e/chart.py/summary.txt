  "conclusion": "The code is a complex but legitimate data visualization and transformation library. There is no evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or system harm. The obfuscation and dynamic features are typical for such utilities but should be monitored if external untrusted inputs influence the code. The malware score is 0, obfuscation around 0.4, and overall security risk low (~0.2)."
