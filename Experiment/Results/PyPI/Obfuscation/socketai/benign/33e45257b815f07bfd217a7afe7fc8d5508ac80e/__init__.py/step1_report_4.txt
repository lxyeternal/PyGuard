{
  "purpose": "This code attempts to import specific modules from the current package, handling import errors based on an environment variable, and retrieves a version string from resources.",
  "sources": "The code reads the environment variable 'AWE_BUILD' and calls resources.get('VERSION') for the version string.",
  "sinks": "The environment variable 'AWE_BUILD' influences control flow; resources.get('VERSION') may be used elsewhere in the application, but its direct use here is limited.",
  "flows": "If imports fail and 'AWE_BUILD' is not set, an ImportError is raised; otherwise, the variables are set to None. The version info is fetched from resources.",
  "anomalies": "The module imports include obfuscated names, which could be an attempt to hide their purpose. The use of environment variable 'AWE_BUILD' suggests different behaviors during build time, possibly for conditional loading.",
  "analysis": "The code performs conditional imports with obfuscated module names, likely to conceal their true purpose. The use of environment variables to control import failure behavior is a common build pattern, not inherently malicious. The retrieval of version info from resources is standard. No suspicious network activity, code injection, or data leakage mechanisms are present. The obfuscated identifiers could be designed to hinder static analysis but do not by themselves indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code appears to be part of a package setup or conditional loading process with no clear malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily obfuscated import statements and environment-based control flow, with no evident malicious activity or security risks. The obfuscated names may serve to hinder analysis but are not inherently malicious.",
