{
  "purpose": "The code performs conditional imports of obfuscated modules, handling ImportError based on an environment variable, and accesses a resource 'VERSION'. It appears to be part of a build or packaging process with obfuscated identifiers.",
  "sources": "The environment variable 'AWE_BUILD' and the resources.get('VERSION') call.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating data leaks, network activity, or malicious effects are present.",
  "flows": "Conditional import attempts influenced by 'AWE_BUILD', with resource access via resources.get('VERSION').",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated module and variable names, environment-dependent import error handling, and resource access without further context.",
  "analysis": "The code's obfuscation and environment-based control flow are typical in build scripts or proprietary packaging. No malicious activity, data exfiltration, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The obfuscation may serve legitimate purposes or conceal malicious intent, but there is no direct evidence. The environment variable handling is standard for build environments. Scores assigned in the reports are consistent with this analysis, with malware scores at zero and low security risk. Obfuscation scores are justified due to obfuscated identifiers. Overall, the code appears benign but warrants cautious monitoring due to obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is likely part of a proprietary or build-related module with obfuscated identifiers and environment-dependent import handling. No malicious activity or security vulnerabilities are detected. The current low malware and risk scores are appropriate; obfuscation remains a concern but not evidence of malicious intent.",
