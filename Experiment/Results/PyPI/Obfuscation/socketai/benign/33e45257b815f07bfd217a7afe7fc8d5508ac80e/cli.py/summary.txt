  "conclusion": "The code is a sophisticated CLI management utility with obfuscated and dynamic features. While no direct malicious activity is detected, the obfuscation and dynamic invocation could be exploited. Scores should reflect low malware likelihood but moderate risk due to obfuscation and dynamic features. Further static and dynamic analysis, especially of imported modules and input validation, is recommended."
