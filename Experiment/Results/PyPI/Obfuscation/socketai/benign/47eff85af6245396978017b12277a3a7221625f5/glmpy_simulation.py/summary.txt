  "conclusion": "The code is a standard simulation management class with superficial obfuscation in variable names. No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious sabotage is present. The primary concern is superficial obfuscation, which justifies a moderate malware and obfuscation score, but overall security risk remains low. The code appears safe for use with standard precautions."
