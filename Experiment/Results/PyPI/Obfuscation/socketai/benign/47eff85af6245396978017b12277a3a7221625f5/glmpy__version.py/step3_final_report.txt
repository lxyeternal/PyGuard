  "purpose": "Static JSON metadata containing version, revision, date, and status information for a software package.",
  "sources": "Reading static JSON fields: date, dirty, error, full-revisionid, version.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no external data flow or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; static data with no processing.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual future date (2025) but not malicious; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static JSON object with versioning and metadata information. No executable code, no external communication, no data processing. The future date is notable but not indicative of malicious intent. All signals point to benign metadata. No obfuscation, no malware, and no security risks are present. The scores are consistent with the static, benign nature of the data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign static metadata with no malicious activity or security risks. All reports correctly identify this, and the scoring is appropriate. No adjustments needed.",
