  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate version management utility, with no malicious activity or sabotage detected. Obfuscation exists but appears stylistic or generated, not malicious. The assigned malware score of 0 and low security risk score (~0.2) are justified. The obfuscation score (~0.3-0.5) is moderate but not indicative of malicious intent. Overall, the code is benign and suitable for use in build processes."
