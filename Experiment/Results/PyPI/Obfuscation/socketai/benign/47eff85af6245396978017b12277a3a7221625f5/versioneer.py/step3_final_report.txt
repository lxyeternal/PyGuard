{
  "purpose": "The code manages version information extraction from files and git repositories, supporting build and release processes.",
  "sources": "Reads from version files (_version.py), configuration files (pyproject.toml, setup.cfg), and executes git commands via subprocess to gather version data.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls to git, file read/write operations, and regex parsing of version info.",
  "flows": "Source data from files and subprocess outputs flow into version dictionaries and version string computations, which may then be written back to files.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variable names and complex regex parsing; no hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns; code appears stylistic or auto-generated.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard version management tasks, invoking git commands and parsing configuration files. No network activity, secrets, or malicious commands are present. Obfuscation is limited to variable naming and regex complexity, which is typical in build tools. The subprocess calls are controlled and standard for version retrieval. No signs of sabotage, backdoors, or data exfiltration are evident. The code's purpose aligns with benign version control and build automation routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate version management utility, with no malicious activity or sabotage detected. Obfuscation exists but appears stylistic or generated, not malicious. The assigned malware score of 0 and low security risk score (~0.2) are justified. The obfuscation score (~0.3-0.5) is moderate but not indicative of malicious intent. Overall, the code is benign and suitable for use in build processes.",
