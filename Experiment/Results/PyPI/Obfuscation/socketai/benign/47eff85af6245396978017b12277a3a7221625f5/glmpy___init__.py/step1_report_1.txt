  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform some data processing or functionality typical of a Python package, but the specific intent is unclear without additional context.",
  "sources": "Potential sources include input functions, environment variables, or external data reads, but none are explicitly evident in the visible code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include network requests, file writes, or system commands; however, no explicit sinks are observed in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "No clear data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks is apparent; the code seems to be self-contained with no external data or command executions visible.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual language features are present. The code structure appears normal.",
  "analysis": "The code is examined for common security issues and malicious patterns. There are no signs of code injection, data leakage, or unsafe external interactions. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets, suspicious dynamic execution, or obfuscated segments. Given the lack of external inputs, network activity, or file operations, the likelihood of malicious intent is low. The code appears standard, with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems benign and does not exhibit any malware or obfuscated features. The overall security risk is low, with high confidence in this assessment.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
