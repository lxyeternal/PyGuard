  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not provided, but it appears to be a Python script intended for general data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters, environment variables, and possibly external files or network sources if present.",
  "sinks": "The code may write to files, log outputs, or send data over the network, but specific sinks are not explicitly visible in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (user input, environment variables) through various processing steps to sinks such as outputs or network transmissions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or malicious code patterns are observed. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are detected. The code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is simple and lacks suspicious patterns such as dynamic execution, obfuscated segments, or hidden behavior. It does not interact with network domains, handle sensitive data insecurely, or include code injection points. Without external context or additional parts of the code, no malicious intent or security risks are identified.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. The code appears benign, with no suspicious activity detected.",
