  "purpose": "Minimal import of an obfuscated symbol from a local module, exposing 'AudioEffectsChain'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .dsp module, specifically the symbol 'pJLDFgtubuDJOviIPdgbrDccUzOrstwY'.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data flows or external communications in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Import source to module namespace; no further data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated symbol name, which could be auto-generated or intentionally concealed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a symbol with a nonsensical, obfuscated name from a local module, with no additional logic or data handling. The suspicious aspect is the obfuscated identifier, which could be used to hide malicious code or simply be a result of code obfuscation. No malicious activity, network activity, or data leaks are evident. The high obfuscation score (around 0.8) is justified, while malware likelihood remains low (0.2 or below). The minimal code and lack of active malicious indicators suggest a low security risk, but the obfuscation warrants further review of the 'dsp' module to confirm safety.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet is benign in function but suspicious due to the obfuscated symbol name. No evidence of malicious behavior is present. The high obfuscation score reflects suspicion, but the malware and risk scores remain low given the lack of active malicious activity. Further inspection of the 'dsp' module is recommended to ensure the imported symbol is safe.",
