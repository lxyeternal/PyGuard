  "conclusion": "The snippet is benign in function but suspicious due to the obfuscated symbol name. No evidence of malicious behavior is present. The high obfuscation score reflects suspicion, but the malware and risk scores remain low given the lack of active malicious activity. Further inspection of the 'dsp' module is recommended to ensure the imported symbol is safe."
