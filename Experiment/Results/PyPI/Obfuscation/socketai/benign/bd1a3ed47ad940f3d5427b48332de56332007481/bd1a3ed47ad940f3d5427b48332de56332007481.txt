      "obfuscated": 0.75,
      "confidence": 0.7,
      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard package setup script with significant obfuscation and syntax irregularities. There is no direct evidence of malicious behavior, but the obfuscation and malformed syntax raise suspicion. The malware score should be increased slightly due to these anomalies, but overall, the code does not demonstrate active malicious actions. Static analysis or dynamic sandbox testing is recommended for definitive assessment."

      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The snippet is benign in function but suspicious due to the obfuscated symbol name. No evidence of malicious behavior is present. The high obfuscation score reflects suspicion, but the malware and risk scores remain low given the lack of active malicious activity. Further inspection of the 'dsp' module is recommended to ensure the imported symbol is safe."

      "obfuscated": 0.8,
      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated, complex audio processing wrapper with no explicit malicious activity but potential security risks due to dynamic command execution and lack of input sanitization. It warrants cautious review, especially ensuring all inputs are validated before use to prevent command injection. The overall threat level is moderate, with high obfuscation and placeholders complicating security assessment."
