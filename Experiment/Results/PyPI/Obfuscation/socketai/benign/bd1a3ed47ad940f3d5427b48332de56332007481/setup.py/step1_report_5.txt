  "purpose": "To define a Python package setup configuration for distribution, specifying metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file, package setup parameters",
  "sinks": "No obvious sinks for untrusted data; setup functions and file reads are standard and safe.",
  "flows": "Read README.md -> setup parameters",
  "anomalies": "Use of obscure variable names (e.g., zZLPCHTnbxwqZZrkarxVCLFreweZathV, vgnZpQUVYxhgSIBBZpPlkAmHYbQCBwNc=) which may indicate obfuscation or concealment. The 'license' parameter is set to a string 'MIT', but the 'text/markdown' appears misplaced or malformed in the 'license' argument. The 'keywords' argument is a list, but incorrectly assigned as a string list; the 'version' and 'name' fields are normal. No malicious code or backdoors are present, but variable obfuscation and formatting irregularities are suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard setup configuration, reading a README file and defining package metadata. The variable names are intentionally obscure, which may indicate an attempt to hide or obfuscate details. The 'license' argument's value appears to be misformatted, potentially leading to setup errors but not malicious intent. No code execution, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are detected. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate setup script with obfuscated variable names, possibly to evade detection or due to poor coding style.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration with obfuscated variable names. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior but exhibits unusual variable naming conventions that could suggest obfuscation or concealment. No security risks are identified beyond coding style irregularities.",
