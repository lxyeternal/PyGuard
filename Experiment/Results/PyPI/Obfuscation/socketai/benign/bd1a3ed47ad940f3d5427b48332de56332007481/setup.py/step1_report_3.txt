  "purpose": "Set up a Python package with metadata, including reading a README file and specifying dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file, defining setup parameters, importing 'setuptools'.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; setup parameters are static or from known sources.",
  "flows": "Reading README file → setup configuration parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names (e.g., zZLPCHTnbxwqZZrkarxVCLFreweZathV, ySbdqAppFUGtAhBuaeSLVEgImsGWffeP), which are unusual and suspicious for benign code. No actual malicious code or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' to perform package setup. It reads the 'README.md' file to include as long description, which is standard. The variable names used are highly obfuscated, which is uncommon for legitimate setup scripts and may suggest concealment. The 'setup' function includes metadata with a license, version, classifiers, keywords, and dependencies. No code injection, malicious network activity, or suspicious behavior is present. The obfuscation appears to be the only anomaly but does not indicate malicious intent by itself.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks, but the obfuscated variable names are unusual and could warrant further review to confirm they are harmless. Overall, the code appears benign.",
