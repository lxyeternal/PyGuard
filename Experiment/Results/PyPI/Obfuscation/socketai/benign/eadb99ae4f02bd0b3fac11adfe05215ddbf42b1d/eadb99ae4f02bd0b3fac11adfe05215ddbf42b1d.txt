      "obfuscated": 0.75,
      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits signs of heavy obfuscation and potential concealment tactics, with suspicious import usage and non-standard queue methods. While no direct malicious activity is confirmed, the patterns suggest caution. The overall security risk is moderate, and malware likelihood is low but non-negligible. Further dynamic and static analysis is recommended before deployment."

      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated and complex, which warrants caution. However, there is no direct evidence of malicious activity such as network access, data theft, or system modification. The obfuscation alone could be used to conceal malicious payloads, but based on current analysis, the overall security risk is moderate, primarily due to obfuscation and dynamic control flow."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of shared memory-backed numpy arrays with obfuscated naming, serving high-performance multiprocessing purposes. No malicious activity or payloads are detected. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. The overall security risk is low, with scores aligned to the analysis."

      "conclusion": "The code is a highly obfuscated multiprocessing task management system with no direct evidence of malicious activity. Its design allows for complex process and task control, which could be exploited for sabotage or covert operations. The obfuscation and suppression mechanisms raise suspicion but do not confirm malicious intent. The overall security risk is moderate, and the malware likelihood remains low. Continuous monitoring and further review of associated modules are recommended before deployment."
