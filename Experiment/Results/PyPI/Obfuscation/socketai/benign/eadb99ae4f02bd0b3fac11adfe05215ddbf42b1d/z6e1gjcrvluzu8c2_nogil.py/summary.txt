  "conclusion": "The code exhibits signs of heavy obfuscation and potential concealment tactics, with suspicious import usage and non-standard queue methods. While no direct malicious activity is confirmed, the patterns suggest caution. The overall security risk is moderate, and malware likelihood is low but non-negligible. Further dynamic and static analysis is recommended before deployment."
