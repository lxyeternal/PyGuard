  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of shared memory-backed numpy arrays with obfuscated naming, serving high-performance multiprocessing purposes. No malicious activity or payloads are detected. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. The overall security risk is low, with scores aligned to the analysis."
