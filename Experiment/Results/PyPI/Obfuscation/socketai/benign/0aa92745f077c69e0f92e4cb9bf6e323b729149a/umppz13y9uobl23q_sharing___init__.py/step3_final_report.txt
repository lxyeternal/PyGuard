  "purpose": "Assess supply chain security risks of the open source dependency based on provided code analysis reports.",
  "sources": "Code snippets, code patterns indicating dynamic execution (`exec`, `eval`), obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, complex constructs, data input points such as environment variables, files, network sockets.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, system modifications, network transmissions, use of untrusted inputs leading to code execution or information disclosure.",
  "flows": "Sources like environment variables or input files flow into code execution points (`exec`, `eval`) or data processing functions, potentially leading to malicious actions or data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious constructs such as dynamic code execution, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, complex or unusual code patterns, absence of code where expected, or indications of malicious intent based on description.",
  "analysis": "The reports consistently identify high suspicion in Report 1 due to indicators like `exec`, obfuscation, and hardcoded credentials, justifying high malware (0.75), obfuscated (0.7), and security risk (0.8) scores. Reports 2, 3, 4, and 5 describe benign or absent code, with scores appropriately set to zero or low values. The reasoning in all reports aligns with their scores, and no logical inconsistencies are evident. The suspicion in Report 1 is supported by the described behaviors, while the others correctly reflect benign or unavailable code scenarios.",
  "conclusion": "The analysis confirms that Report 1's high scores are justified by the suspicious behaviors described, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent. The benign assessments in other reports are consistent with their descriptions. Overall, the scoring is appropriate and reflects the evidence provided.",
