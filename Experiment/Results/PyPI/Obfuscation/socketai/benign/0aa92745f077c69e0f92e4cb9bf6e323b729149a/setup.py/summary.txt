  "conclusion": "The code exhibits obfuscation and uses a risky pattern of executing external code via exec(), which could be exploited if the external version file is malicious. While no direct malware is present, the pattern is suspicious and warrants further inspection of the external file. The overall security risk is moderate to high, and the obfuscation increases suspicion. It is recommended to avoid using exec() on external files and to ensure that version information is obtained through safer means."
