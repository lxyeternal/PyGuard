{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package that reads version information from an external file and configures package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from an external file (__version__.py) via open() and exec(); reading README.md for long description.",
  "sinks": "exec() executes external code, which could run malicious payloads if the file is compromised.",
  "flows": "File read (__version__.py) -> exec() -> code execution; reading README.md is benign.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, suspicious filename 'abst' instead of a standard filename, use of exec() on external code.",
  "analysis": "The script uses obfuscated variable names and constructs a path to a file named 'abst/__version__.py', which is unusual and suspicious. The use of exec() to run external code from this file is a significant security risk, as malicious code could be executed if the file is compromised. The code reads README.md normally. The obfuscation and risky pattern of executing external code indicate potential malicious intent or poor security practices. No direct malicious payloads are evident, but the pattern warrants caution. The scores assigned in the reports (malware around 0.2-0.4, security risk around 0.4-0.7) are appropriate, though the overall risk should be considered higher due to the exec() pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits obfuscation and uses a risky pattern of executing external code via exec(), which could be exploited if the external version file is malicious. While no direct malware is present, the pattern is suspicious and warrants further inspection of the external file. The overall security risk is moderate to high, and the obfuscation increases suspicion. It is recommended to avoid using exec() on external files and to ensure that version information is obtained through safer means.",
