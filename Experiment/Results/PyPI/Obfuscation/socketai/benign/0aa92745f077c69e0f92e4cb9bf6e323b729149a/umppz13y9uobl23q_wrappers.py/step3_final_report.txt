{
  "purpose": "Decorators for resource cleanup, configuration loading, and method invocation, primarily managing connection/session attributes.",
  "sources": "Object attributes (e.g., connected, active_tunnel, response), external configuration loaded via 'abst.bastion_support.oci_bastion'.",
  "sinks": "Modifications to object attributes, external configuration loading, method calls on objects.",
  "flows": "Input data (objects, configs) are used to modify object attributes and invoke methods; external config influences behavior.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function and variable names, dynamic import of external module within decorators, indirect attribute manipulation, no hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three decorators that manipulate object attributes, load external configurations, and invoke methods. Obfuscated names and external module imports ('abst.bastion_support.oci_bastion') are red flags indicating potential concealment of malicious intent. No direct malicious actions such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection are evident. The external module could be malicious if compromised, but based solely on this code, no malicious payloads are confirmed. The obfuscation and external dependencies warrant caution but do not constitute definitive malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to serve utility functions related to resource and session management with obfuscated naming and external dependencies. While no overt malicious activity is detected, the obfuscation and reliance on external modules pose potential risks. Further review of the external module and its trustworthiness is recommended. The overall malware score is low, but obfuscation and external dependency concerns justify a moderate security risk.",
