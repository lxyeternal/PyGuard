  "conclusion": "The code appears to serve utility functions related to resource and session management with obfuscated naming and external dependencies. While no overt malicious activity is detected, the obfuscation and reliance on external modules pose potential risks. Further review of the external module and its trustworthiness is recommended. The overall malware score is low, but obfuscation and external dependency concerns justify a moderate security risk."
