  "sinks": "Reading SSH key files from disk; no other sinks identified",
  "flows": "SSH file path input -> file read operation in ilNovMQwnOBTMHIBEHzMaGJqRxRMkgUF",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials (except default paths), no suspicious code patterns, no obfuscation, no network or malicious behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code sets various default file paths and configurations based on the user's home directory. It includes a function to read an SSH key file, which expands user paths and reads the file contents. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The paths and function appear standard for configuration management. No obfuscated or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard configuration setup with a simple file reading function. There are no indicators of malicious intent or supply chain attacks. It appears safe based on the provided snippet.",
