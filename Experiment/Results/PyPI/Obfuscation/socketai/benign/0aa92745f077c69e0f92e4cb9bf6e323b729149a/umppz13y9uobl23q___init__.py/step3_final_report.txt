  "purpose": "To assess the supply chain security and potential malicious behavior of the provided Python code snippet.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables, imports standard libraries, and interacts with network modules.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks via environment variables, network connections, or file operations.",
  "flows": "Source: environment variables or input functions; Sink: network modules or file I/O.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes standard libraries for environment variable access and network communication. No malicious functions, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. No obfuscation or suspicious dynamic code execution. The code appears routine, with no indicators of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The malware score is set to 0, obfuscation score to 0, and security risk score to 0.2, reflecting low risk consistent with routine code.",
