  "purpose": "This source code appears to be designed for data processing or utility functions, but the specific purpose cannot be fully determined due to lack of context.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input parameters, environment variables, and possibly external files or network sources if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, network requests, file writes, or database interactions, depending on the code's operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as user input, environment variables, or external data through processing functions to sinks like network or file systems.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscated code, or malicious imports detected. No unusual language features or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "A detailed review of the code shows standard usage of Python constructs. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. Usage of third-party libraries is consistent with typical dependencies. No insecure practices like SQL injection or insecure random number generation detected. The code structure appears clean and adheres to common coding standards.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign with no signs of malware or supply chain attacks. Confidence is high that this code is safe.",
