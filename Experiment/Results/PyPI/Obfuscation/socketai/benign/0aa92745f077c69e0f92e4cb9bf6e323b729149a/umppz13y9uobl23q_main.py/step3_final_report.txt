  "purpose": "A CLI management tool for context switching, credential cleanup, version display, and configuration management.",
  "sources": "Imports of constants, configuration files, user input prompts, network requests, and file system operations.",
  "sinks": "File deletions, configuration reads/writes, network connectivity checks, and user prompts.",
  "flows": "Input from user prompts or configuration files flows into file operations and network requests; network calls may communicate with external servers; user inputs influence control flow and file operations.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with nonsensical variable and function names, large recursion and thread stack limits, numerous imported constants with unclear purpose, and nonspecific import modules. No direct malicious code such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a CLI for managing contexts, credentials, and versions, with multiple obfuscated variables and extensive imports. No malicious actions like data theft or remote code execution are observed. The obfuscation and high system limits are suspicious but could be legitimate for complex management tasks. Network requests appear benign, primarily version checks. File operations are straightforward, with user confirmation before deletion. The overall structure suggests a management utility with obfuscation techniques that could conceal malicious intent but do not confirm it.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit concrete malicious behavior. The high obfuscation and extensive imports warrant caution, but no active malware or malicious activity is confirmed. The low malware score (0.1) and moderate risk score (0.3) are appropriate based on current evidence.",
