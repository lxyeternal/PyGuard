  "purpose": "Importing specific modules or functions from internal package components",
  "sources": "Import statements from relative modules: .api and .request",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no data processing or external output is visible",
  "flows": "No data flows identified; only import statements, no data handling or external communication",
  "anomalies": "The imported name 'iRYWuyYgJobeEgmqxdJMnqGuNHhrgfel' appears as a nonsensical, randomly generated identifier, which could suggest obfuscation or malicious intent",
  "analysis": "The code contains two import statements. The first imports a symbol with a highly unusual name that resembles a random string, which may indicate obfuscation or malicious activity. The second imports a module named 'Request' from the local package. There are no further code elements, data handling, or network activity to analyze. The suspicious element is the import name, which is not descriptive and appears intentionally obfuscated, raising concern about potential malicious intent or hidden behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal but contains an unusually named import that could be part of obfuscated or malicious code. Without additional context, this raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious activity. The import pattern suggests potential obfuscation or concealment.",
