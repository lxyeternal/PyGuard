      "security_risk": 0.1,
      "obfuscated": 0.7,
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The obfuscation alone does not constitute a security threat. The overall security risk is very low."

      "security_risk": 0.2,
      "obfuscated": 0.7,
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a sophisticated, obfuscated HTTP request handler with features common in web scraping or automation tools. No malicious payloads or behaviors are detected. While obfuscation and proxy usage could be exploited, the code itself appears benign. The current malware score of 0.2 is appropriate, and risk remains low but warrants caution if used in untrusted environments."

      "obfuscated": 0.7,
      "confidence": 0.6,
      "conclusion": "The code is benign in structure but suspicious due to the obfuscated symbol name. No active malicious activity is evident, but further investigation of the source module is advised to confirm whether the symbol is benign or malicious. The current scores are appropriate given the evidence."

      "security_risk": 0.5,
      "obfuscated": 0.8,
      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code functions as an obfuscated, flexible HTTP request wrapper with no explicit malicious payloads or active malware within this snippet. Its heavy obfuscation and dynamic request handling pose potential risks if misused or integrated with malicious inputs, warranting cautious review. The current evidence suggests low likelihood of malware but moderate concern due to obfuscation and potential for misuse."
