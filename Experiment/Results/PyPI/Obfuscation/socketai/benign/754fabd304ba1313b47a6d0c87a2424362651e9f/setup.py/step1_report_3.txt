  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'ksimpleapi', including reading a README file for long description.",
  "sources": "os.path.join(os.getcwd(), 'README.md') and open() to read file content",
  "sinks": "setuptools.setup() call, which uses the read content and package metadata",
  "flows": "Reads README.md file content, then passes it as a parameter to setuptools.setup()",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names, but no suspicious hardcoded credentials or malicious commands; no data exfiltration or network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard package setup with reading a README file for description. The obfuscated variable names do not influence behavior but suggest code obfuscation or concealment. No network connections, data leaks, or malicious behavior are evident. All dependencies are standard, and no suspicious code execution is present.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a typical Python package setup script with obfuscated variable names. No malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behavior are detected. The code is safe for use.",
