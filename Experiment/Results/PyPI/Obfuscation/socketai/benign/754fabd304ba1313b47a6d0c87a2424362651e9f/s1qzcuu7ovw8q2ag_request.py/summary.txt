  "conclusion": "The code is a sophisticated, obfuscated HTTP request handler with features common in web scraping or automation tools. No malicious payloads or behaviors are detected. While obfuscation and proxy usage could be exploited, the code itself appears benign. The current malware score of 0.2 is appropriate, and risk remains low but warrants caution if used in untrusted environments."
