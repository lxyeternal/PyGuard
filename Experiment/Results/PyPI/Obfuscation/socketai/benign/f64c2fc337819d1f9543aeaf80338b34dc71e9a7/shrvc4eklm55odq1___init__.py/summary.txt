  "conclusion": "The code functions as a visualization component with structural issues and potential injection risks if inputs are untrusted. There is no evidence of malware or malicious intent. The primary concerns are incomplete code and lack of sanitization, which could be exploited in a malicious context. Scores are set accordingly: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0.3-0.4, security risk = 0.3."
