{
  "purpose": "This code defines a setup script for a Python package called 'streamlit-timeline', facilitating its distribution and installation via setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.md file to obtain the long description of the package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data leaks are evident in the code.",
  "flows": "The flow involves reading the README.md file as input and passing its content to the setuptools.setup() function for package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "The function wdWQdkfFpwMXPuiQwYnXdlpLWTiOHUuj() has an obfuscated name, but it only reads a static README.md file without executing code or reading untrusted input. The package dependencies are specified with a standard version requirement. There are no hardcoded credentials, network calls, or code that could be malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a typical package setup by importing os.path and setuptools. It defines a function with an obfuscated name to read the README.md file content for the long description. The setup() call includes standard package metadata and dependencies. No suspicious code, network activity, or potential for malicious behavior is present. The obfuscated function name appears to be a deliberate attempt at hiding purpose, but it only reads a static file. Overall, the code is consistent with normal package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python module, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscated function name does not correspond to malicious intent, and no suspicious activity is detected.",
