{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package named 'streamlit-timeline' using setuptools, primarily to facilitate distribution and installation.",
  "sources": "Reads the content of 'README.md' file located in the same directory as the script.",
  "sinks": "None of the code involves handling untrusted data inputs or outputs that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The 'long_description' source (from 'README.md') is used in the setup process, but there are no data flows involving untrusted inputs to sinks that cause harm.",
  "anomalies": "The function name 'wdWQdkfFpwMXPuiQwYnXdlpLWTiOHUuj' is nonsensical and obfuscated, which might indicate an attempt to conceal purpose. The variable 'haYXYmFvtjHInMLYvmoMozBSwTbsoOAA' is also unusual and seems to be an obfuscated list of dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules for path handling and setuptools for packaging. It defines a function with an obfuscated name to read 'README.md'. The setup() call uses this function to set 'long_description'. The package metadata appears legitimate. The presence of obfuscated function and variable names is suspicious but does not inherently indicate malicious intent. There are no network connections, file manipulations beyond reading a README, or code execution. The code structure and content align with typical setup scripts, aside from obfuscation. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard Python package setup with obfuscated naming. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. The obfuscation may be intended to conceal the simplicity of the code but does not translate into malicious activity.",
