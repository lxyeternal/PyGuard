  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distributing the 'streamlit-timeline' Python package.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long_description via open(join(dirname(__file__), 'README.md')).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data exfiltration points identified.",
  "flows": "The code reads the README.md file to include as the package's long description; no external data flow or untrusted input to a critical sink.",
  "anomalies": "The function name 'wdWQdkfFpwMXPuiQwYnXdlpLWTiOHUuj' appears intentionally obfuscated but only reads a static file; no actual obfuscation or malicious obfuscation techniques detected. The variable 'haYXYmFvtjHInMLYvmoMozBSwTbsoOAA' is a list of dependencies with a non-standard name but not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up a Python package using setuptools. It includes a function that reads a local README.md file for the long description, which is standard practice. No code injections, network connections, or malicious behavior are present. The obfuscated function name and variable name are unusual but do not indicate malicious intent; they merely obscure the code's purpose without performing any suspicious actions. The dependencies are standard, and the package metadata is typical. No sensitive data, credentials, or backdoors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package with no malicious or suspicious activity. The obfuscation appears superficial and does not suggest malicious intent. Overall, the package setup is standard and safe.",
