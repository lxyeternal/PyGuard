  "purpose": "Static configuration setup for Sphinx documentation, including project info, theme, static files, and build parameters.",
  "sources": "Variables defining project metadata, theme, static files, and import statements for configuration modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static configuration without data flow or external data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static assignments and imports only.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated variable names that do not convey meaning; insertion of parent directory into sys.path, which could be misused but appears benign here.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static setup script for documentation, with no network activity, user input, or dynamic code execution. Variable names are obfuscated, possibly autogenerated, but this does not imply malicious intent. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or code injection is evident. The obfuscation is superficial and typical for autogenerated code. The scores assigned (malware=0, risk=0.2, obfuscated around 0.4-0.6) are consistent with the static, benign nature of the code. The code's purpose is purely configuration, with no indicators of sabotage or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static configuration script for documentation with obfuscated variable names but no malicious or security-threatening behavior. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No further action or modification of scores is necessary.",
