  "purpose": "Import native functions and symbols related to quantum computing operations from the pyqir._native module.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing functions and variables from 'pyqir._native', including several obfuscated or non-descriptive identifiers.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; the code only imports symbols.",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as there are no data flows, input handling, or untrusted data processing shown.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of numerous obfuscated or non-descriptive variable names, potentially indicating attempts to hide malicious intent or complexity. The imported list includes both standard quantum operations (e.g., barrier, ccx, swap) and obscure identifiers. The `__all__` list mixes common quantum gate names with obscure entries, some of which are not standard (e.g., mz, if_result).",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of an import statement from a native module, importing several functions and variables, some with suspicious or obfuscated names. The list `__all__` exposes standard quantum gates and additional identifiers, possibly to control symbol export. There is no code execution, data handling, or network activity. The obfuscated names could be benign, but their presence alongside standard quantum operations warrants caution. No malicious behavior or malicious code patterns are evident. The obfuscation might be for internal implementation hiding or to conceal malicious functions, but based solely on this code fragment, there is no definitive malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward import and export list from a native module, with some obfuscated identifiers. There is no direct evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks within this fragment. The obfuscation may warrant further review of the native module itself, but based solely on this snippet, the risk appears low.",
