{
  "purpose": "Import native functions related to quantum computing and define __all__ for export.",
  "sources": "Native module 'pyqir._native' functions and variables, including obfuscated identifiers.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present; code only imports and exports symbols.",
  "flows": "Import statements with obfuscated identifiers, no data flow or execution beyond imports.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated or nonsensical identifiers, which could indicate concealment but are not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple functions and variables from a native module, some with clear quantum gate names, others obfuscated. The __all__ list includes standard quantum gates and some ambiguous identifiers. No data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. Obfuscation raises suspicion but is common in internal or proprietary code. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or system disruption is observed. Malware and security risk scores are low, consistent with benign native bindings. The obfuscation score is moderate, reflecting the identifiers' nonsensical names. Overall, the code appears to be a standard interface for a quantum library with obfuscated internal names, with no active threats detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign native binding module for quantum operations, with obfuscated identifiers that warrant further review but do not indicate malicious intent. Malware risk is negligible; the obfuscation is the only notable concern, which is justified by the scores. Overall security risk remains low.",
