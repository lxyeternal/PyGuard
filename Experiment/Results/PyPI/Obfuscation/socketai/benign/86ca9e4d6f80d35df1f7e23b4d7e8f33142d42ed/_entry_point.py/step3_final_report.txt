  "purpose": "Creates a pyqir Function object with metadata attributes set based on input parameters.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: name, required_num_qubits, required_num_results, qir_profiles, output_labeling_schema",
  "sinks": "None; only sets string attributes on the Function object",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used directly to set attributes; no external data flow or untrusted data processing",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; no malicious code or suspicious logic present",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that creates a pyqir Function object, assigns several string attributes based on parameters, and returns it. Variable names are obfuscated but consistent with code obfuscation practices. No network, file, or environment interactions occur. The attributes are metadata, not executable code or secrets. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or data exfiltration are detected. The obfuscation appears stylistic, not malicious. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, low security risk, moderate obfuscation) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for setting metadata on quantum functions. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present. The obfuscation is stylistic, and the low security risk scores are justified. The malware score should remain at 0, and the obfuscation score around 0.2-0.4 is appropriate given variable naming. Overall, the code is safe and does not pose security concerns.",
