{
  "purpose": "Define a function that creates and annotates a quantum intermediate representation (QIR) function in a module.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to the function, specifically 'name', 'required_num_qubits', 'required_num_results', 'qir_profiles', and 'output_labeling_schema'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, the use of these parameters in attributes of the created function object, which could influence code behavior or metadata.",
  "flows": "Parameters are used to set string attributes on a function object created within the function. No external data flows are apparent.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated constructs, or suspicious dynamic code execution. The code appears straightforward and uses standard library calls.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the pyqir library and defines a function that constructs a new Function object with a specific type derived from the module's type. It adds string attributes to this function, including 'entry_point', 'required_num_qubits', 'required_num_results', 'qir_profiles', and optionally 'output_labeling_schema'. These attributes are used for metadata annotation and do not execute any untrusted code or contain embedded malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic are present. The function simply creates and annotates a QIR function object based on input parameters.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility for creating a quantum function with metadata annotations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It appears benign and intended for standard use in quantum programming workflows.",
