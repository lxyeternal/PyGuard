{
  "purpose": "Define and create a quantum intermediate representation (QIR) function with specific attributes.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'name', 'required_num_qubits', 'required_num_results', 'qir_profiles', and 'output_labeling_schema'.",
  "sinks": "Adding string attributes to the function object, which could potentially include untrusted input if parameters are maliciously provided.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to generate a Function object, and attributes are attached to this object. No network or external data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically creates attributes based on input parameters, but there are no unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors. The naming is obfuscated but consistent with normal code obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pyqir' library and defines a function to create a new 'Function' object. It uses the 'Type' and 'Function' classes from the library, setting attributes with 'add_string_attribute'. The attribute values are derived directly from function parameters, including numerical values converted to strings. No external network calls, data exfiltration, or malicious logic are present. The obfuscated variable names do not indicate malicious intent but do suggest possible code obfuscation or minification. All operations appear to be standard for setting up a quantum function with metadata.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup for defining a quantum function with specified attributes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leakage. The use of obfuscated variable names is not inherently malicious but warrants cautious review if code obfuscation is undesired. Overall, it seems to serve a legitimate purpose related to quantum program setup.",
