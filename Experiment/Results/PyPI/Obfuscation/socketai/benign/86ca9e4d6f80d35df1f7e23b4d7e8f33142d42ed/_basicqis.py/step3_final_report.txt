  "purpose": "Wrapper around 'pyqir.qis' functions to facilitate quantum circuit operations.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from 'control', 'target', 'qubit', 'theta', 'cond', and 'result' parameters; calls to 'qis' functions with these parameters.",
  "sinks": "Calls to 'qis' functions; no external data exfiltration or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Input values are passed from method parameters to 'qis' functions; no external sinks or data leaks detected.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code; code structure is straightforward, but naming is intentionally obscure.",
  "analysis": "The code is a wrapper class that delegates quantum operation calls to the 'qis' module, using obfuscated identifiers to conceal its purpose. No network, file, or data exfiltration activity is present. The obfuscation appears to be a deliberate attempt to hide implementation details, but the functionality remains benign. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behaviors are detected. The use of lambdas for conditional operations is standard and not suspicious. The overall structure suggests a benign abstraction layer, possibly auto-generated or intentionally obscured for concealment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated wrapper around 'pyqir.qis' functions, with no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. The high obfuscation score is justified, but the malware score remains zero. The overall security risk is very low. The obfuscation appears to be for concealment rather than malicious intent.",
