  "purpose": "Static import statements for pyqir quantum IR components and related functions.",
  "sources": "Import statements from pyqir modules, including native, simple, entry_point, basicqis, constants, and passes.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows; only module imports with no runtime code execution.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static import declarations without data flow or execution.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated or cryptic identifiers (e.g., 'NHYAeJWQakqjurFSYFdmCCMuVBonEDyR') and functions like 'dynamic_qubit_management' that could be misused if combined with malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements importing various components from pyqir, a quantum IR library. The identifiers include obfuscated names, which could be used to hide malicious intent, but in this static context, no active code or data processing occurs. The functions and constants imported are standard for such a library, and no network or data leakage activities are evident. The obfuscation scores are high, reflecting the cryptic identifiers, but this alone does not indicate malicious behavior. The malware score remains zero, consistent with the static nature of the code. The security risk is low, as no active threats are present. The confidence in this assessment is moderate to high, given the static analysis and lack of runtime behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static import list from the pyqir library, with obfuscated identifiers that could be used to conceal malicious intent but do not demonstrate active malicious behavior. The supply chain risk based on this snippet is minimal. Scores are appropriately assigned: malware = 0, obfuscated = approximately 0.6, security risk = 0.2.",
