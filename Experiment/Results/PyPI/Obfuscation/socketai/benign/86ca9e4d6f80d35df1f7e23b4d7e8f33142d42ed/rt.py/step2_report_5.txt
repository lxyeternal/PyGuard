  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code performs a simple import of functions from a native module and defines an `__all__` list. There are no signs of data processing, input handling, or suspicious logic.\n   - The code appears benign, with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly state that the code is straightforward, minimal, and standard for exposing native functions.\n   - No logical errors or misconceptions are evident.\n\n3. **Scores review:**\n   - **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the simplicity and transparency of the code.\n   - **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the absence of malicious indicators.\n   - **Security risk score:** Mostly 0 or very low (0.1), which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n   - **Confidence scores:** High (mostly 1), justified given the clear and straightforward analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for higher risk scores:**\n   - Since the code is just importing functions from a native extension and exporting them, with no data processing, network activity, or suspicious patterns, there's no basis for assigning higher risk scores.\n   - The malware score remains 0, as there's no indication of malicious intent or behavior.\n\n5. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's structure and content.\n\n6. **Consistency of scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis. Given the benign nature, scores of 0 or near-zero are appropriate.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a straightforward module that imports functions from a native extension and exposes them via `__all__`. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nNo changes needed; the assessment is accurate and justified.",
