{
  "purpose": "The code exports functions from the 'pyqir._native' module, likely for use in a larger application or package that interacts with native code for quantum-related operations.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'pyqir._native' module; defines '__all__' for public API.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks or places where untrusted data is processed or outputted.",
  "flows": "Import from native module to exported symbols; no data flow paths suggestive of malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs; simple import and export statements.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions from a native module, which may involve compiled code or C extensions. It then defines '__all__' for controlling public API exposure. There are no data inputs, outputs, or processing logic that could indicate malicious behavior. The structure is minimal and standard for Python modules that wrap native libraries.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward module that exposes functions from a native extension without any suspicious or malicious behavior. It does not include any code that could be considered malware or security risk.",
