{
  "purpose": "This code imports specific functions from the 'pyqir._native' module and defines an export list for the module.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the 'pyqir._native' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform security-critical actions are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the imported functions into the module's namespace, but no data processing or untrusted data handling is evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no unusual code constructs, dynamic execution, or obfuscated code. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple import of functions from a native extension module and declares an explicit list of exported names. There are no input sources or potential data sinks. The structure is typical for Python modules that wrap native code. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code are observed. The code is minimal and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard module import and export declaration with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, suspicious behavior, or obfuscated code. Overall, it is safe based on the analysis.",
