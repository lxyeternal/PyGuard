{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific functions from a native module 'pyqir._native' and defines the public API via __all__.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'pyqir._native' module",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data processing or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "Import statement leading to the __all__ definition; no data flow beyond that",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; simple import and export of functions with no logic or data handling",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward import of functions from a native extension module, likely written in C or C++, and sets the module's public API. There are no data inputs, outputs, or processing logic. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present. The code appears to be standard boilerplate for exposing native functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module import and export definition with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
