  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a simple import and export of functions from a native module.\n- No data processing, untrusted data handling, or suspicious patterns are observed.\n- The code appears to be boilerplate for exposing native functions, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Confirmation of Issues:**\n- The code does **not** contain any logic, data flow, or processing that could be malicious.\n- No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present.\n- The functions imported are from a native extension, which is common in performance-critical or specialized libraries, but their presence alone does not imply malicious intent.\n\n**Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n- They assign a malware score of 0 and very low or zero security risk scores, which are appropriate.\n- The confidence levels are high, reflecting a solid understanding.\n\n**Scores Evaluation:**\n- Malware scores: all are 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- Obfuscated scores: all are 0, consistent with no obfuscation.\n- Risk scores: mostly 0 or very low (0.1), which is reasonable given the benign nature.\n\n**Justification for Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n- None of the reports suggest any malicious activity or significant security risk.\n- The native module could, in theory, contain malicious code, but there's no evidence here.\n- Therefore, the risk scores should remain very low or zero.\n\n**Challenging Assumptions:**\n- The assumption that native modules are safe is common but not absolute; malicious code could be hidden in native extensions.\n- However, based solely on this code snippet and the reports, there's no indication of malicious intent.\n\n**Consistency Check:**\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- No discrepancies or unreasonable score assignments are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final Personal Assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation detected.\n\n**Risk score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- If the native module `pyqir._native` is from a trusted source, the overall risk remains minimal.\n- If there's concern about the native extension's content, further inspection of the native code itself would be necessary, but that is outside the scope of this snippet.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is benign, standard boilerplate for exposing native functions, with no malicious or security issues apparent from the provided information.",
