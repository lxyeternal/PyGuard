  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code imports four functions from a native module `pyqir._native`.\n- It then defines `__all__` to expose these functions as the public API.\n- There is no data processing, no input/output handling, no dynamic code, no obfuscation, and no suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** None. All reports agree that the code is straightforward, minimal, and benign.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- **Logical or security flaws:** None identified. The code is standard boilerplate for exposing native functions in Python.\n\n### Score Evaluations:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign a score of 0 or very close to 0, indicating no malicious activity. This is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the code's simplicity.\n- **Security risk score:** Also very low or zero, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since the code only imports and re-exports functions from a native extension, and no data processing or external communications are involved, the risk is minimal.\n- The code does not perform any suspicious operations, obfuscation, or contain hardcoded secrets.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores across reports are consistent and appropriate.\n- The confidence levels are high, reflecting a clear understanding that the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risk identified)\n\n**Overall conclusion:** The code is a standard, benign module interface exposing native functions with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** If I were to assign scores independently, I would keep all scores at zero, given the evidence. The reports are accurate and comprehensive.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No further action needed; the code is safe.",
