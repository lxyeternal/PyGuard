  "purpose": "Expose native functions from the 'pyqir._native' module as part of the public API.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'pyqir._native' module.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Import of functions, then exporting via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import/export pattern, no obfuscation or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports four functions from a native extension and defines __all__ to expose them. It contains no data processing, input/output handling, dynamic code, or suspicious patterns. The code is minimal and standard for exposing native functions. No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The native module's trustworthiness is outside this code's scope, but the code itself is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward interface exposing native functions with no security concerns or malicious intent detected.",
