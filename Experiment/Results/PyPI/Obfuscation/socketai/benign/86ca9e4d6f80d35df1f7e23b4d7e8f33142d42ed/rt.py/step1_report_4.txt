  "purpose": "Export specific functions from the pyqir._native module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the pyqir._native module.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; code only imports and exports functions without data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports four functions from a native module and then explicitly exports them via __all__ for module API exposure. No data input, no processing, and no suspicious activity are present. The code is minimal, straightforward, and appears to be a standard module interface definition. No indicators of malicious intent, backdoors, or sabotage are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module interface setup with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It merely re-exports functions from a native extension for use elsewhere.",
