{
  "purpose": "The code exports functions from the 'pyqir._native' module for external use, likely related to quantum intermediate representation processing.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'pyqir._native' module, which loads functions into the namespace.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external communications.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code simply imports and exposes functions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The import and export pattern is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions from a native extension module and defines an __all__ list for export. There are no data processing, no network operations, and no suspicious logic. The module appears to be a typical interface layer for native bindings, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module exposing native functions. No malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies are detected. It appears to be a benign component of a larger project.",
