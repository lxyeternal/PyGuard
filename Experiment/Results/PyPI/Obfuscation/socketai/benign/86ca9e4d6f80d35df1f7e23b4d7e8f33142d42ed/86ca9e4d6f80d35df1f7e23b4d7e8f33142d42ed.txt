The supply chain risk based on this snippet is minimal. Scores are appropriately assigned: malware = 0, obfuscated = approximately 0.6, security risk = 0.2."

Malware risk is negligible; the obfuscation is the only notable concern, which is justified by the scores. Overall security risk remains low."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for setting metadata on quantum functions. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present. The obfuscation is stylistic, and the low security risk scores are justified. The malware score should remain at 0, and the obfuscation score around 0.2-0.4 is appropriate given variable naming. Overall, the code is safe and does not pose security concerns."

The primary concern is obfuscation, which could be used to conceal malicious intent but is not inherently malicious here. The malware score should remain at 0.1, and the overall security risk is low."

The high obfuscation score is justified, but the malware score remains zero. The overall security risk is very low. The obfuscation appears to be for concealment rather than malicious intent."
