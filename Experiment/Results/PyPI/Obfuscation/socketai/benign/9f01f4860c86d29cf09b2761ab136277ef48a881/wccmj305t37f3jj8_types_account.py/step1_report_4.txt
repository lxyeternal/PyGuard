{
  "purpose": "Define data structures for account information and an enumeration for categorization, likely part of a larger application.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules and attributes; class attribute definitions; potential external base class import.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network calls, file writes, or eval statements observed.",
  "flows": "Data is assigned to class attributes; no evident data flow to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class names and variable names; import from a relative module which may be standard or obfuscated; no explicit malicious code but unusual naming conventions suggest possible obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class definitions with attributes, including sensitive fields like 'access_token'. The import from a local module and the use of obfuscated identifiers could be attempts at hiding intent but do not directly indicate malicious behavior. No network activity, data exfiltration, or suspicious logic detected. The code appears to be part of a larger system, possibly with obfuscated or auto-generated identifiers. The lack of direct malicious actions or external communication points to a low likelihood of malicious intent based solely on this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to define data structures with obfuscated identifiers and no evident malicious activity. It likely belongs to a larger application where further analysis could reveal more. No malicious behavior or security risks are clearly present in this fragment.",
