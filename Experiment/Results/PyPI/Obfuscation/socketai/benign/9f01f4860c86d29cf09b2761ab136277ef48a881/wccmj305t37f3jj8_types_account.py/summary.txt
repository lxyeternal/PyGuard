  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a structural data container with obfuscated identifiers, no active malicious behavior detected. Obfuscation warrants caution but does not justify high malware or risk scores. The current assessment assigns a malware score of 0, obfuscation score around 0.7, and a low security risk (~0.2). Continuous monitoring and broader code review are advised."
