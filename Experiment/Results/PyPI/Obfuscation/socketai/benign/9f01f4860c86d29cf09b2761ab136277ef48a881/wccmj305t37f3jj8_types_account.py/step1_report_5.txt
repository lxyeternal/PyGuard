  "purpose": "Define data structures and enums related to account information and possibly API interactions.",
  "sources": "Attributes of class IViYhtRevizTEgFXBpTFIfdnXGgFIuAP such as 'access_token', 'author_url', 'auth_url', 'page_count'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive attributes like 'access_token', 'author_url', 'auth_url' which could be misused if exposed, but no direct data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from class attributes to potential external usage, but no explicit source-to-sink flows are shown in this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated class name 'IViYhtRevizTEgFXBpTFIfdnXGgFIuAP', which may indicate obfuscation. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are directly visible. The code relies on imported modules and standard enum/class structures.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a data class with attributes that may hold sensitive information like 'access_token', which could pose security risks if mishandled. The class name appears obfuscated, which could be an attempt to hide its purpose, but there are no direct signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, file modification, or credential theft. The enum also appears standard. There are no dynamic executions or suspicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard data structure definition with obfuscated naming but lacks signs of malicious intent or malware. No malicious behavior is detectable in this fragment.",
