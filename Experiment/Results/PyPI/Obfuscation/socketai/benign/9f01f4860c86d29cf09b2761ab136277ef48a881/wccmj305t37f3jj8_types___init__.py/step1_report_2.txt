{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that imports various components from other modules within the same package, and defines an __all__ list for exports.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from import statements referencing other modules within the package.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; imports are static references to other modules.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated names for imported classes and variables (e.g., IViYhtRevizTEgFXBpTFIfdnXGgFIuAP, xLFCtmmxBtapVicWGXvBLiWRbMNFzADa). These appear intentionally scrambled, which could suggest obfuscation. However, obfuscation alone is not malicious; it could be for privacy or code protection.",
  "analysis": "The code only performs import statements from internal modules and defines an __all__ list for public API exposure. The imported class and variable names are intentionally scrambled, indicating possible obfuscation. No network, file, or environment variable access is evident. No dynamic code execution or suspicious logic present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily an import and export declaration with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malicious data flow, or suspicious activity. The obfuscation could be benign or for privacy reasons, but no malicious intent is detectable.",
