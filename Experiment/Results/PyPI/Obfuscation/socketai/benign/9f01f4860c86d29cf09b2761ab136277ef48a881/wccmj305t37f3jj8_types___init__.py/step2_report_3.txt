  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code snippet provided.\n\n**Overall Code Summary:**\n- The code performs static import statements from local modules, with obfuscated class and variable names.\n- It defines an `__all__` list to specify exported symbols.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, data handling, or external inputs are present.\n- The symbol names are intentionally obfuscated, which could be for concealment or code protection.\n- The code appears to be a typical package interface or API module.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Standard module interface with obfuscated names.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.7\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly notes the lack of malicious activity, data flow, or external interactions. The obfuscation is identified but deemed not inherently malicious. The high confidence aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1; imports and defines `__all__`.\n- **Malware score:** 0.0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.8\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report emphasizes obfuscation but concludes there's no malicious behavior. The security risk is minimal, which is reasonable given the code snippet.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.7\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the analysis aligns with the code: no malicious activity, just obfuscated imports, typical for modular packages.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Same, standard import/export.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.7\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with previous reports; no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Similar, notes obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** 0.0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.6\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.7\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report mentions possible concealment but finds no malicious activity. The security risk score is slightly higher (0.2), which could be justified if obfuscation is considered a potential indicator of malicious intent, but without further evidence, this is conservative.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nThe assessment is cautious but reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of all reports:**\n- All reports agree that the code is primarily import/export with obfuscated identifiers.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or dynamic execution.\n- Obfuscation alone is not sufficient to assign a high malware score.\n- The security risk scores are low, reflecting the absence of active threats.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Evaluation:**\n\n**Malware score:**  \nGiven the code snippet and the analyses, **the malware score should remain at 0**, as there is no indication of malicious payload, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.\n\n**Obfuscated score:**  \nThe obfuscation is evident and intentional, so **a score around 0.7** remains appropriate.\n\n**Risk score:**  \nSince there's no malicious activity or security vulnerability present, **a risk score of 0.1 to 0.2** is justified, reflecting caution due to obfuscation but no active threat.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n| Score Type       | Recommended Value | Justification                                                  |\n|------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                   | No evidence of malicious activity.                            |\n| Obfuscated       | 0.7                 | Obfuscated identifiers are present, possibly for concealment.|\n| Risk             | 0.2                 | Slight caution due to obfuscation but no active risk.        |\n\n**Final note:**  \nWhile obfuscation can sometimes hide malicious intent, in this context, the code appears to be a standard package interface with obfuscated internal symbols. No further malicious indicators are evident.",
