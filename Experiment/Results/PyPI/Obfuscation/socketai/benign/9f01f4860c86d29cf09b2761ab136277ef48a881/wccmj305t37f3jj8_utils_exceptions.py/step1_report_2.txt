  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes with additional class-level behavior and constants, including subclasses representing specific error types.",
  "sources": "Class initializations, class variable assignments, method calls, string manipulations, and class inheritance.",
  "sinks": "Instantiation of subclasses, exception raising, and class method calls that may propagate data.",
  "flows": "Class definitions → __init_subclass__ modifications → exception raising in class methods → subclass instantiations.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names, extensive use of string replacements and uppercasing, dynamic class behavior, and class-level lists tracking subclasses.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an exception hierarchy with obfuscated class and variable names, using class-level attributes and methods that manipulate class data, including string replacements and conditional returns. Several subclasses represent specific error types with predefined messages or error codes. No external input handling, network communication, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident. The complex obfuscation appears intended to hide the true intent but does not align with typical malicious behaviors such as data theft, network communication, or system compromise. The pattern resembles an elaborate error management system, not malware. No suspicious external dependencies or dangerous code flows are identified. The obfuscation could be for concealment but does not directly imply malicious intent. The code’s malicious potential is low, primarily due to the lack of active external interactions or harmful operations.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to implement an obfuscated error handling class hierarchy with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It mainly manages custom exceptions with some obfuscation techniques. The likelihood of malicious intent is low.",
