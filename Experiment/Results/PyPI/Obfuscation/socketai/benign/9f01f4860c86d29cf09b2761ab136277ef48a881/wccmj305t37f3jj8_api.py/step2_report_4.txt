  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their conclusions, the evidence they present, and the potential risks involved.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a legitimate API client for 'telegra.ph', with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Key points:** Obfuscated variable names, minimal comments, no hardcoded credentials, standard network and file operations.\n- **Risk assessment:** Low malware risk (0), low security risk (~0.2), obfuscation present but benign.\n- **Justification:** The analysis is consistent; no evidence of malware or sabotage. Obfuscation alone is not suspicious in this context.\n\n**Score suggestion:** Keep as is. The low malware score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, it recognizes obfuscation but finds no malicious intent.\n- **Key points:** Obfuscated names, support for proxies, no hardcoded secrets, standard API client behavior.\n- **Risk assessment:** Malware score 0, security risk 0.3, due to proxy support and obfuscation.\n- **Justification:** Obfuscation could be used to conceal malicious code, but in this context, it appears to be for concealment, not malicious intent.\n\n**Score suggestion:** Maintain as is. The malware risk remains negligible.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Also describes a legitimate client with obfuscation, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Key points:** Obfuscated variable names, proxy support, no hardcoded secrets, standard network operations.\n- **Risk assessment:** Malware 0.1, security risk 0.2.\n- **Justification:** Slight suspicion due to obfuscation and proxy support, but no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n**Score suggestion:** Accept current scores; the malware score is low, reflecting minimal suspicion.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports; legitimate API client with obfuscation.\n- **Key points:** Obfuscated variable names, no hardcoded secrets, standard API interactions.\n- **Risk assessment:** Malware 0, security risk 0.2.\n- **Justification:** Obfuscation and proxy support are noted but do not imply malicious intent.\n\n**Score suggestion:** Keep as is.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Recognizes obfuscation but finds no malicious activity.\n- **Key points:** Utility functions, standard API client, no hardcoded secrets, minimal suspicious network activity.\n- **Risk assessment:** Malware 0, security risk 0.2.\n- **Justification:** Obfuscation is common in some legitimate libraries; no malicious indicators.\n\n**Score suggestion:** Appropriate as is.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are at or near zero, which aligns with the analysis indicating no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** Slightly high (~0.6-0.7), justified by the obfuscated variable and function names, which seem intended to hinder reverse engineering but are not necessarily malicious.\n- **Risk scores:** Remain low (~0.2-0.3), consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### My final judgment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no evidence of malware.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0.6** — obfuscation is present but not necessarily malicious.\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** — low security risk, primarily due to obfuscation and proxy support.\n\n**Note:** The code appears to be a legitimate, albeit obfuscated, API client for 'telegra.ph'. No malicious intent or sabotage is evident from the provided analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Estimate |\n|----------------|----------------|\n| Malware        | 0              |\n| Obfuscated     | 0.6            |\n| Security Risk  | 0.2            |\n\nThis comprehensive review supports the conclusion that the code is low risk, with obfuscation being the main concern but not indicative of malicious activity.",
