  "purpose": "Module imports and package initialization, defining exports and version.",
  "sources": "Import statements from relative modules and an API module.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks or data leaks; no use of untrusted data sources.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow analysis needed as there is no data processing or external input handling.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable name 'LWpnURqJEQQrBKkJjacelYWJuzXyyESD' assigned to a version string; no clear purpose or documentation. No apparent malicious code or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard import operations from internal modules and sets an export list. The variable 'LWpnURqJEQQrBKkJjacelYWJuzXyyESD' appears to be an obfuscated or auto-generated name, possibly intended to hide version info or prevent straightforward inspection. There are no signs of malicious activity such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The import of a possibly complex or hidden API function ('TMXdLOsvaOOUKGPUtLgyzdZEGiPcwivd') does not in itself indicate malicious intent, especially without further context.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard module setup with an obfuscated variable that may serve as a version identifier. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident from the provided code.",
