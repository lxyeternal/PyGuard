{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform data processing and network communication tasks typical of legitimate open source scripts, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, configuration files, network endpoints, input data streams",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variables, system commands",
  "flows": "Input data from sources flows into processing functions, then potentially to network or file sinks",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious network domains, obfuscated code, or unusual data flows detected",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious payloads. The absence of suspicious network activity, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors supports a benign assessment. The security risk score of 0.2 reflects minimal inherent vulnerabilities typical of open source scripts. Confidence is high (0.9), given the detailed review and lack of suspicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious intent or supply chain compromise. The low security risk score and malware score of 0 are justified. The assessments across reports are consistent and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.2,
