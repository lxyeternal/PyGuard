  "purpose": "Define a data class 'GoGBeqCuKDMBaeqarDoseIMsHvlJGCkF' for representing a list of pages with a total count.",
  "sources": "Imports from typing, attr, and relative module imports; class attribute definitions.",
  "fires": "None evident in this code; no untrusted input handling or network operations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated-looking class and variable names; no apparent sensitive data or secrets; no suspicious hardcoded credentials.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party libraries, then defines a class with attributes for total count and a list of page objects, using data class conventions. No external input processing, network communication, or security-sensitive operations are present. The code appears to be a standard data structure definition with intentionally obfuscated names, likely to obscure intent but not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical data class definition with obfuscated naming. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based on the provided content.",
