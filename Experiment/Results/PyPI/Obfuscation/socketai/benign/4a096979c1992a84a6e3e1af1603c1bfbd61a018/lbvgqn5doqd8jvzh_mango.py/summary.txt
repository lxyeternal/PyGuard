  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates high-risk patterns involving dynamic code execution, proxying, and obfuscation, which could be exploited for malicious purposes such as remote code execution or SSRF. While no explicit malware payloads are present, the design and behavior patterns warrant a high security concern and thorough review before deployment."
