  "conclusion": "The dependency code shows moderate obfuscation suspicion without evidence of malicious payloads or malicious activity. The low malware and security risk scores are appropriate. The overall assessment indicates a cautious approach, emphasizing the need for further review if code is obtained, but no immediate threat is identified."
