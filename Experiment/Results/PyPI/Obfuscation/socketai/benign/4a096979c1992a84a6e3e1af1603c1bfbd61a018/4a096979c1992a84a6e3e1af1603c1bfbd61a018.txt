      "confidence": 0.85,
      "conclusion": "The script is a superficially obfuscated setup configuration with no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The obfuscation and unusual argument suggest an attempt to conceal, but without active malicious actions, it is considered benign. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is high (0.7), and security risk is low (0.2)."

      "obfuscated": 0.8,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, heavily obfuscated web API setup with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The obfuscation alone is suspicious but not evidence of malicious behavior. The current scores in the reports overstate potential threats; they should be adjusted to reflect the lack of malicious activity, setting malware to 0.0, maintaining high obfuscation scores, and keeping the security risk low (~0.2). Continuous monitoring is advised due to obfuscation, but based on this snippet, the code is considered safe."

      "obfuscated": 0.4,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The dependency code shows moderate obfuscation suspicion without evidence of malicious payloads or malicious activity. The low malware and security risk scores are appropriate. The overall assessment indicates a cautious approach, emphasizing the need for further review if code is obtained, but no immediate threat is identified."

      "obfuscated": 0.8,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits insecure practices, including lack of input validation, potential directory traversal vulnerabilities, and obfuscation. While there is no evidence of active malicious behavior or malware, the security flaws pose a significant risk if exploited. The malware score should remain low (~0.2), but the security risk score should be increased (~0.65) to reflect these vulnerabilities."

      "obfuscated": 0.8,
      "confidence": 0.85,
      "conclusion": "The code demonstrates high-risk patterns involving dynamic code execution, proxying, and obfuscation, which could be exploited for malicious purposes such as remote code execution or SSRF. While no explicit malware payloads are present, the design and behavior patterns warrant a high security concern and thorough review before deployment."
