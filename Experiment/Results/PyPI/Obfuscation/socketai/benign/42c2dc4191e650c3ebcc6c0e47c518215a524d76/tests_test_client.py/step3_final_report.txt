  "purpose": "Unit tests for a Python client interacting with the Marketo API, including token management, lead operations, and error handling.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded API keys, secrets, domain URLs, and mock HTTP responses within test functions.",
  "sinks": "Mocked API endpoints; no real data leakage or network activity; no untrusted data sinks evident.",
  "flows": "Test functions invoke methods that simulate API calls via mocks; no actual data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded credentials and domain URLs in test code; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard test suite employing mocks for network interactions. It contains hardcoded secrets used solely within testing contexts, which is common but should be avoided in production. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are present. The use of mocks and controlled responses indicates no real network activity or malicious intent. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test suite with no evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. The main security concern is the use of hardcoded secrets, which should be managed securely outside of test environments. The malware score remains 0, obfuscated score 0, and the security risk score is appropriately low (~0.2) given the context.",
