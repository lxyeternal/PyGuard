  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test suite with no evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. The main security concern is the use of hardcoded secrets, which should be managed securely outside of test environments. The malware score remains 0, obfuscated score 0, and the security risk score is appropriately low (~0.2) given the context."
