  "purpose": "Utility functions for URL query parsing and data streaming, likely used in testing or data processing contexts.",
  "sources": "Parsing URL query strings via urllib.parse.parse_qsl; reading data from class attribute for streaming.",
  "sinks": "Yielding data chunks; no external data sinks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Input URL data flows into parse_qsl, then into a dictionary; class yields stored data chunks.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated variable and class names; no validation or sanitization of external input; no malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard URL parsing and data streaming with obfuscated identifiers. No network activity, file operations, or data exfiltration are present. Obfuscation may be for concealment but does not imply malicious intent. The functions are simple and benign, serving utility or test purposes. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors are evident. The code's behavior aligns with benign utility code, with obfuscation being the main concern but not indicative of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign utility or test code with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, network activity, or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation is notable but not malicious. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score should remain at 0.",
