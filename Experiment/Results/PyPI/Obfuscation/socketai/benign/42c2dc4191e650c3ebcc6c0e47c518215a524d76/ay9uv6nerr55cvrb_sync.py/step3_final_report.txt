{
  "purpose": "A Singer tap for Marketo, managing API data extraction, bookmarks, and incremental syncs.",
  "sources": "API calls to Marketo endpoints, reading bookmarks and state files.",
  "sinks": "Writing records to output streams, updating bookmarks and state.",
  "flows": "Source data from API -> parse and process -> write records -> update bookmarks/state -> repeat with pagination.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variable and function names, random import names, and large buffer constants, but no malicious network activity or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a standard ETL pipeline for Marketo, with API interactions, pagination, and state management. Obfuscation appears to be due to auto-generated or IP-protection measures rather than malicious intent. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or payloads are detected. The malware score is 0, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior. Obfuscation scores vary but are justified by the naming patterns. The overall security risk is low (0.2).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured Singer tap for Marketo, with obfuscation likely for IP or code concealment. No evidence of malicious activity or payloads is present, and the security risk is minimal.",
