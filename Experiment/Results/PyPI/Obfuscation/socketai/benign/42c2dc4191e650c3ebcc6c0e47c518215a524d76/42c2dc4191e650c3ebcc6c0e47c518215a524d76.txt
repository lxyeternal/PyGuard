The high obfuscation scores are justified, and the low malware score reflects the absence of active malicious actions. Moderate security risk warrants caution, but no immediate threat is confirmed."

There is no evidence of malicious intent or activity. The obfuscation and dynamic path handling warrant caution but do not constitute malicious behavior based on the provided analysis. The malware score remains at 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2-0.3)."

Obfuscation is likely for proprietary or obfuscation purposes rather than malicious concealment. The low malware and security risk scores are appropriate, with a moderate obfuscation suspicion score. Overall, the code poses minimal security concern but warrants caution due to obfuscation."
