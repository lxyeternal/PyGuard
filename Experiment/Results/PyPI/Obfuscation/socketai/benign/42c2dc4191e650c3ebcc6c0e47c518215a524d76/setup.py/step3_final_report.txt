{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package, including metadata and entry points.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata, obfuscated variable names, malformed 'entry_points' dictionary.",
  "sinks": "No active data sinks or network activity detected; code primarily defines package setup.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration, no dynamic data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, syntax errors, incomplete or malformed 'entry_points' and 'install_requires' structure, inconsistent formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code is a setup script with obfuscated variable names and syntax anomalies, such as misplaced '=' signs and incomplete dictionaries. No evidence of dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration. The anomalies suggest obfuscation or corruption, which could be used to conceal malicious intent, but static analysis shows no active malicious behavior. The obfuscation and malformed structure justify high suspicion, but without evidence of malicious actions, the code appears to be intentionally obfuscated or malformed rather than malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is suspicious due to obfuscation and syntax anomalies but lacks concrete evidence of active malware or malicious behavior. The high obfuscation scores are justified, and the low malware score reflects the absence of active malicious actions. Moderate security risk warrants caution, but no immediate threat is confirmed.",
