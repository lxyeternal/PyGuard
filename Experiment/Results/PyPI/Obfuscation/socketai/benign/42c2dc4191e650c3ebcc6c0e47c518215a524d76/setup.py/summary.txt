  "conclusion": "The code is suspicious due to obfuscation and syntax anomalies but lacks concrete evidence of active malware or malicious behavior. The high obfuscation scores are justified, and the low malware score reflects the absence of active malicious actions. Moderate security risk warrants caution, but no immediate threat is confirmed."
