  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with superficial obfuscation and a likely typo in the encoding parameter. No malicious activity or supply chain attack is evident. The main concern is correcting the encoding string to ensure proper execution. The overall security risk is minimal, and the current scores are appropriate."
