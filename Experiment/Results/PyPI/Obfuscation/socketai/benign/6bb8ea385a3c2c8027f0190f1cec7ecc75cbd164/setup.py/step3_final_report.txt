  "anomalies": "Use of an unusual string 'TlOERguQeBGvjIulQttNgrDZFylthTWX=' as the encoding parameter; obfuscated variable names; potential typo or corruption in encoding.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with superficial obfuscation and a malformed encoding string. The variable names are nonsensical but do not affect functionality. The suspicious string used as encoding is likely a typo or obfuscation artifact, which would cause a runtime error if executed as-is. No malicious code, network activity, or data exfiltration is present. The obfuscation is superficial, and the main issue is the invalid encoding parameter. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0, obfuscation ~0.7, low risk 0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the evidence. The main recommendation is to correct the encoding string to 'utf8' to prevent runtime errors. There is no indication of malicious intent or supply chain compromise.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with superficial obfuscation and a likely typo in the encoding parameter. No malicious activity or supply chain attack is evident. The main concern is correcting the encoding string to ensure proper execution. The overall security risk is minimal, and the current scores are appropriate.",
