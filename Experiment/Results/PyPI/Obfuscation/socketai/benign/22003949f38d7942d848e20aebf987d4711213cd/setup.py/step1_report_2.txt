{
  "purpose": "This setup script is intended to compile a Cython extension module named 'monotonic_align.core' from the source file 'src/core.pyx'.",
  "sources": "The code reads no input or external data; it primarily defines build instructions for a Python package extension.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks; no data is being written or transmitted, and no runtime data handling is present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow exists; the script only specifies build configuration without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for compiling Cython extensions; no unusual or suspicious behavior is detected. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define a Cython extension module. It specifies a single source file 'src/core.pyx' for compilation. No external inputs, user data, or network communications are involved. The code is typical for Python extension building and does not exhibit obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script for building a Cython extension module. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. No anomalies or suspicious activities are identified.",
