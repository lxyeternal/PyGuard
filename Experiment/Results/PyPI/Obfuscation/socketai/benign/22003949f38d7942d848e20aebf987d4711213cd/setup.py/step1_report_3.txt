  "purpose": "Set up script for building a Python Cython extension module named 'monotonic_align.core'.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'src/core.pyx' source file for compilation.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that handle untrusted data or perform dangerous actions.",
  "flows": "Source is the 'src/core.pyx' file used for extension compilation; no data flow to sinks involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "Uses Cython's pyx source file, which is standard for extension modules; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code found.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'Extension' and 'setup' from setuptools to define and compile a Cython extension module. It specifies the extension name and the source file. The source file 'src/core.pyx' is a Cython source, not executable code with embedded logic, and is used in building extensions. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data leakage, or suspicious network activity. The code appears to be a standard setup script for compiling an extension module.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script for building a Cython extension module with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks.",
