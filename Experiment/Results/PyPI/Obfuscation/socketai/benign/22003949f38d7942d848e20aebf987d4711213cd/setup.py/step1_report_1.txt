{
  "purpose": "Setup script to build a Python extension module using Cython",
  "sources": "Reads the 'src/core.pyx' file as source code for compilation",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating untrusted data processing or data leak points",
  "flows": "Source ('src/core.pyx') is used directly in the build process; no data flow to external sinks",
  "anomalies": "Uses Cython source file (.pyx) but this is common for extension modules; no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' for package setup and defines an extension module 'monotonic_align.core' with a source file 'src/core.pyx'. This is standard for building compiled extension modules via Cython. No input/output operations, no suspicious behaviors, or obfuscated code are present. The use of Cython source files is typical for performance optimization, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration for building a Python extension module with Cython. It does not contain any malicious code, suspicious behavior, or security risks. It is a normal part of package development.",
