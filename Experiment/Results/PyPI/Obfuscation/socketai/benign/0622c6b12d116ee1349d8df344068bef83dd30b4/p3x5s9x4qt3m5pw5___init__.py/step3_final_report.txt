  "purpose": "Module import setup with optional dependencies, using obfuscated variable names for internal components.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules: notedown, main, contentsmanager; handling of ImportError for optional modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, external communication, or system modifications detected.",
  "flows": "Import statements and exception handling flow without external data or network interactions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names (e.g., GtBsagLlWHxPrWvEDCfNMKWpzFqXcvUE, UVQlUmioFelwZcoHbJthlUIsRvGvObpx); use of try-except for optional dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard module imports with error handling for missing optional dependencies. Obfuscated variable names are suspicious but do not execute malicious actions or communicate externally. No code injection, data leakage, or system modifications are present. The obfuscation may serve to hinder reverse engineering but does not indicate malicious intent. The fallback string for missing modules is benign. Scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscation moderate, low security risk) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical import setup with obfuscated internal variables, showing no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. Obfuscation alone does not imply malicious intent. The overall security risk is low.",
