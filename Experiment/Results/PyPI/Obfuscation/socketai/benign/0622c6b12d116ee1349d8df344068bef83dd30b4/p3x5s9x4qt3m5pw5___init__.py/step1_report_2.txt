{
  "purpose": "Import modules and functions, and handle optional dependencies for a Python package related to notebook or document processing.",
  "sources": "Import statements, especially from relative modules and optional try-except import block.",
  "sinks": "No evident sink points such as network calls, system modifications, or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Data flows are primarily within module imports and assignment of strings; no external data flow evident.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated-looking variable names (e.g., GtBsagLlWHxPrWvEDCfNMKWpzFqXcvUE) and a try-except block that assigns a string indicating missing dependency, which might mask malicious intent but is standard for optional dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules, some with obfuscated variable names, and handles ImportError by assigning a message to variables that appear to be obfuscated. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or file operations are present. The obfuscated variable names may be intended to hide information or mislead. The try-except block only captures import errors related to a specific package, which is a common pattern for optional dependencies. No suspicious or malicious activity is detected within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard import setup with optional dependencies and obfuscated variable names, likely to mask internal details but not indicative of malicious intent. No malware or security risks are evident.",
