{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up module imports for a larger Python package, including optional imports for Jupyter Notebook integration.",
  "sources": "Import statements and try-except block for optional dependencies",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that lead to data leaks or malicious actions",
  "flows": "Import statements and exception handling do not involve data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names (e.g., GtBsagLlWHxPrWvEDCfNMKWpzFqXcvUE, UVQlUmioFelwZcoHbJthlUIsRvGvObpx) which could hide malicious intent, but appear to be benign placeholders or obfuscation for code concealment. The code does not execute any untrusted input or perform malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward imports and handles ImportError with a fallback message. The variable names are unusual and potentially obfuscated, but there is no evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or execution of untrusted code. The logic is simple, primarily managing optional dependencies with no data processing or external communication.",
  "conclusion": "This code is likely benign, serving as an import setup with obfuscated variable names that do not indicate malicious intent. No signs of malware or malicious behavior are present.",
