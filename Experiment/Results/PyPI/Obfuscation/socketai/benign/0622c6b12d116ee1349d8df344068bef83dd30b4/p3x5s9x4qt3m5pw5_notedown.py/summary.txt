  "conclusion": "The code is a complex but legitimate notebook processing utility, with obfuscation that appears stylistic rather than malicious. External subprocess calls are controlled and serve standard purposes. No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads is detected. The obfuscation and regex parsing increase complexity but do not indicate malicious intent."
