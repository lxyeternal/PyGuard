{
  "purpose": "The code provides two functions: one to calculate the mean speed from a DataFrame column, and another to compute the curvature and locate the apex of a path based on position data in a DataFrame.",
  "sources": "Reads data from DataFrame columns: 'SpeedMs', 'WorldPosition_x', and 'WorldPosition_y'.",
  "sinks": "Returns computed values (mean speed, apex data, curvature) within the Python process; no external data sinks or network operations observed.",
  "flows": "Input DataFrame is read to calculate mean speed or to derive differences in position data, which are then used to compute curvature and identify the maximum curvature point.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. The functions perform straightforward statistical and geometric calculations. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden behaviors present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions: one for computing the mean speed with validation of the column presence and data validity; another for calculating a measure of curvature based on derivatives of position data, then locating the maximum curvature point, which is labeled as the 'apex'. The code uses standard pandas operations and mathematical formulas, with appropriate error handling via warnings and None returns. No obfuscated, malicious, or suspicious code elements are present. The code appears to be designed for data analysis tasks involving motion or path analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate data analysis functions for path and speed metrics, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It performs common calculations without any suspicious behavior or hidden operations.",
