  "purpose": "The code provides functions to analyze a pandas DataFrame for specific geometric and statistical properties, such as calculating the mean speed and identifying the apex point based on curvature calculations.",
  "sources": "Reading the DataFrame columns 'SpeedMs', 'WorldPosition_x', and 'WorldPosition_y'.",
  "sinks": "Returns the mean speed value or a dictionary with apex details, no external or untrusted data sinks are used.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the DataFrame columns through calculations of differences, derivatives, and curvature, resulting in either scalar values or a dictionary output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No use of obfuscation or dynamic code execution. The calculations appear standard for data analysis tasks.",
  "analysis": "The functions perform standard data analysis procedures using pandas: computing mean and differences for positions, calculating a form of curvature, and identifying maximum curvature points. All data operations involve DataFrame columns, with no external input or malicious code execution. Warning messages are simple print statements for missing columns or data issues. No signs of code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior are evident. The code does not perform any network operations or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate data analysis utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It reads and processes data using standard pandas operations and does not contain any suspicious behaviors or malware indicators.",
