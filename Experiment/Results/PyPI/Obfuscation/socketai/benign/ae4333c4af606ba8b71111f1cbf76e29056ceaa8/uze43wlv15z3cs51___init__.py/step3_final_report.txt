{
  "purpose": "The code imports modules with obfuscated or nonsensical names, likely to conceal internal implementation details or for proprietary reasons. It does not contain active logic or data flows.",
  "sources": "Import statements from relative modules with obfuscated identifiers.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; only static imports without data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated module and class names, inconsistent __all__ declaration, and absence of executable code or data flow.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with obfuscated identifiers, which is suspicious but not inherently malicious. No active code, network activity, or data processing is present. The high obfuscation scores across reports are justified, but malware scores remain low due to lack of evidence of malicious behavior. The inconsistency between __all__ and imported names could suggest concealment or misconfiguration. Overall, the code's obfuscation warrants caution but does not confirm malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet is heavily obfuscated, raising suspicion, but there is no direct evidence of malware or malicious activity. The risk remains moderate due to obfuscation, but the overall security threat is low. Further investigation of the imported modules is recommended to determine if they contain malicious code.",
