  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate visualization utility for telemetry and positional data with no malicious activity detected. The obfuscation appears to be for complexity or concealment rather than malicious purposes. The overall security assessment remains low risk, with a malware score of 0 and a moderate obfuscation score (~0.4). The minor bug regarding 'track_length' should be fixed for code correctness but does not impact security."
