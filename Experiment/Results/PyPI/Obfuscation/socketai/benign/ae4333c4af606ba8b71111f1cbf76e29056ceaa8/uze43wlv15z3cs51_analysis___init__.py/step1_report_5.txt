  "purpose": "The code imports modules 'basic_stats' and 'streaming' from the same package, likely to utilize their functionalities.",
  "sources": "Imports from local package modules 'basic_stats' and 'streaming'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flow or data processing occurs within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code only contains import statements with relative module references.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two import statements using relative imports, which is common in Python package development. There are no data inputs, network activities, or code execution patterns that could indicate malicious intent. The absence of further logic or function calls suggests this snippet is part of a larger package structure. No suspicious or malicious behavior is identifiable in these import statements alone.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is benign, functioning solely to include local modules. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be a standard module import pattern within a Python package.",
