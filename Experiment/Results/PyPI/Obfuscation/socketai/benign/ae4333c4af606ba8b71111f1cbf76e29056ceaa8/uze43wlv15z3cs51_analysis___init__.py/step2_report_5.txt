  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** The code only contains two import statements with wildcard imports from local modules. No code execution, data flow, or anomalies are present.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** Both are 0, which aligns with the benign analysis.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 is slightly above zero, but given no suspicious activity, this seems marginal.\n- **Verdict:** The reasoning is sound; the code is benign. The low security risk score is acceptable but could be 0 for more consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to Report 1, only import statements, no logic or data handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Security Risk:** 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Verdict:** Correct assessment; no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Uses 'import *' from local modules, which can be a style concern but not inherently malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware is 0, obfuscated is 0, matching the benign assessment.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 is slightly elevated but not indicative of actual risk.\n- **Verdict:** The reasoning is correct; no malicious activity is indicated.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Again, only import statements, no data flow or suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0, matching the benign interpretation.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1, which is minimal.\n- **Verdict:** The analysis is appropriate; no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same as others; straightforward relative imports with no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0, consistent.\n- **Security Risk:** 0, aligning with the benign assessment.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code only contains import statements with no malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** All are 0 or 0.1, which is reasonable given the simplicity of the code.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1), which might be conservative but acceptable, considering the potential for malicious modules to be introduced via imports.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain at 0, as no obfuscation is evident.\n- **Malware score:** Correctly at 0, since no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Security risk:** Could be set to 0 in all cases, unless there's context indicating that relative imports could be exploited (which is unlikely here).\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores based on the code snippet:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk evident)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent with the code. The scores are reasonable, though a risk score of 0 would be more precise.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores reflect this appropriately, and no changes are necessary.",
