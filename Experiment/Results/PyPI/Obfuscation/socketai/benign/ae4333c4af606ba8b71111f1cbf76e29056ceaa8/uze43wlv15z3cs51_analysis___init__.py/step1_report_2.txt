{
  "purpose": "The code imports modules related to basic statistics and streaming functionality, likely part of a larger data processing or analysis package.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing from local modules: .basic_stats and .streaming",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs observed; no data processing or transmission functions are present",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are evident as the code only contains import statements",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only import statements with no additional logic or data handling; no anomalies or suspicious activity detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of relative import statements from local modules. It does not contain any logic, data handling, or external communications. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. Since it is a minimal snippet, its security implications are limited, and no suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as part of a larger package to import specific modules. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks based solely on these import statements.",
