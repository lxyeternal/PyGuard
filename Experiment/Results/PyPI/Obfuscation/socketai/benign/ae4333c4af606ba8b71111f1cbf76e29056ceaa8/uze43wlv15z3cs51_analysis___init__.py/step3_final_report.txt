{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from two local modules, 'basic_stats' and 'streaming', within the same package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules 'basic_stats' and 'streaming'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows; the code only performs static imports.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static import statements do not process untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' can obscure imported symbols but is not inherently malicious or anomalous.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two import statements importing all symbols from local modules. There is no executable logic, data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The use of relative imports is standard in Python packages. Without inspecting the contents of the imported modules, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The minimal nature of the code and the absence of suspicious patterns suggest a benign intent. The import statements do not pose security risks by themselves, and no anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The import statements are standard and do not indicate any compromise or sabotage. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware and obfuscated scores are 0, and security risk scores are minimal (around 0.1), reflecting the benign nature of static imports.",
