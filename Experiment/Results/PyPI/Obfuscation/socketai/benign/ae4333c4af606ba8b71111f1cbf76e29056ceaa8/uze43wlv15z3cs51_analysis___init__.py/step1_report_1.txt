{
  "purpose": "The code imports modules 'basic_stats' and 'streaming' from the current package, likely to use their functionalities within this package.",
  "sources": "Imports modules from relative paths within the package",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed in the code snippet",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow present; imports are static and do not process data at this stage",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative imports is typical, but it could be exploited if malicious modules are introduced; no code execution or obfuscated patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two import statements with wildcard imports from sibling modules. There are no functions, variables, or executable code present. The imports are straightforward and do not indicate malicious intent. Since the code only performs static imports, there are no apparent security risks, malicious behaviors, or anomalies such as hidden code or data exfiltration. The presence of wildcard imports can sometimes be suspicious if the modules themselves are malicious, but based solely on these lines, no malicious activity is indicated.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is benign, performing simple module imports without any signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears to be part of a normal package structure.",
