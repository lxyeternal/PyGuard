  "purpose": "The code imports all functions and classes from two local modules: basic_stats and streaming.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules within the package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external output occurs here.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident within this snippet; it only imports modules.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' from local modules can obscure what is actually imported, but it is not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code only consists of import statements from relative modules. There are no data inputs, external communications, or dynamic code execution present. The use of 'import *' can be a code style concern but does not indicate malicious intent. No suspicious or malicious behavior is observable in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward import statement from internal modules. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be standard module importation within a Python package.",
