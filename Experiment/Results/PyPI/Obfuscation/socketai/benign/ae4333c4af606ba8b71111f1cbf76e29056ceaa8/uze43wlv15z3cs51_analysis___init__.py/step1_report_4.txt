{
  "purpose": "The code imports modules 'basic_stats' and 'streaming' from the same package, likely to include functionalities related to statistical calculations and data streaming.",
  "sources": "Imports modules from the package, which may internally read data or configuration when executed.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling observed in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The code may invoke functions from imported modules, but no explicit data flow is present in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code only contains import statements; no suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution is present.",
  "analysis": "This is a minimal import statement block. It imports all functions or classes from two modules within the same package. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues in this fragment. As it stands, it is a standard import pattern, and any security concerns would depend on the contents of the imported modules, which are not provided.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet alone does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It simply imports modules, and further review of the imported modules would be necessary to determine any security implications.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0,
