  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the associated code snippet.\n\n**Code snippet:**\n```python\nfrom .basic_stats import *\nfrom .streaming import *\n```\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- The code only contains two import statements, importing all contents from two local modules.\n- No functions, variables, or executable code are present.\n- Use of relative imports is typical in Python packages.\n- No data processing, external communication, or dynamic code execution observed.\n- The use of wildcard imports (`import *`) can obscure what is imported but is not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** Benign, no malicious activity, high confidence (0.9).\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is straightforward and contains no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0 is appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 seems slightly high given the benign nature; perhaps 0.05 is more fitting, but not critical.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, correct.\n- **Overall:** No issues here.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Benign, no suspicious activity, high confidence (0.9).\n- **Assessment:** Correct. Same reasoning as above.\n- **Malware score:** 0 is appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** 0 is justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Overall:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Benign, no malicious behavior, high confidence (0.9).\n- **Assessment:** Correct. Use of `import *` is generally discouraged but not malicious.\n- **Malware score:** 0 is appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 might be slightly high; however, since `import *` can sometimes hide unwanted imports, a small risk score is acceptable.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Overall:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Benign, no malicious activity, confidence 0.8.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. Same as above.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 is acceptable given the minimal code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Overall:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Benign, standard import pattern, confidence 1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Overall:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of findings:**\n\n- **Code correctness:** All reports correctly identify that the code only performs static imports with no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, consistent with the code.\n- **Risk scores:** Mostly 0.1 or 0, which are reasonable given the minimal code and no suspicious activity.\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- The scores are consistent and reasonable.\n- The only minor note is that the security risk scores could be slightly lowered to 0 in some reports, but 0.1 is acceptable as a conservative measure.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — the code snippet alone poses no security risk.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate given the code snippet's simplicity. No further action or concern is necessary based solely on these import statements.",
