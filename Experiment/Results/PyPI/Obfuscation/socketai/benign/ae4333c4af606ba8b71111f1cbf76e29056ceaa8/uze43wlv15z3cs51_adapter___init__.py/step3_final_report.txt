  "purpose": "Analyze the provided import statements with obfuscated identifiers for potential malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Local module import statements with non-descriptive, obfuscated names",
  "sinks": "No data flows, external interactions, or executable code present; potential concern is obfuscation",
  "flows": "Not applicable; only import statements without data or control flow",
  "anomalies": "Use of non-descriptive, seemingly random strings as identifiers in import statements",
  "analysis": "The code contains only import statements from local modules with obfuscated names, with no executable logic, data handling, or network activity. The obfuscated identifiers raise suspicion but are not evidence of malicious intent. The reports correctly identify the obfuscation, note the absence of active malicious behavior, and assign low malware and security risk scores. The high suspicion from obfuscation is justified, but without further context, the code appears benign. The scores across reports are consistent and appropriate, reflecting cautious suspicion due to naming but no concrete malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign in isolation but employs obfuscated identifiers, which warrants further review of the actual modules. The current scores are justified: malware score 0, obfuscation high (~0.75), and low security risk (~0.2-0.3). Further investigation into the module contents is recommended to confirm their purpose and ensure no malicious code is concealed.",
