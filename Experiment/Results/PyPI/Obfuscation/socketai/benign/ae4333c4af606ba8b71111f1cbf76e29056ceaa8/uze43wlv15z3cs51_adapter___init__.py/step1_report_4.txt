{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific classes or functions from local modules related to adapters, likely for data processing or transformation.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .adapter, .csv_adapter, .pandas_adapter, .transparent_adapter",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis possible with only import statements; no execution or data handling shown",
  "anomalies": "All imported identifiers are obfuscated, which is unusual but not necessarily malicious; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with obfuscated module and class/function names, which may be an attempt to hide functionality or evade detection. The lack of executable logic limits the assessment. Importing modules itself is not suspicious, but the obfuscation raises some concern. No malicious actions, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors are directly observable from these statements alone.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no explicit signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation of identifiers warrants caution, but with no executable code or data handling, the overall risk appears low.",
  "confidence": 0.4,
  "obfuscated": 0.7,
