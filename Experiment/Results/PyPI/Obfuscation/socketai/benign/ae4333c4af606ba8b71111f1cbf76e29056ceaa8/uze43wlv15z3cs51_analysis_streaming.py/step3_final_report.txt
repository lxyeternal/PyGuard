  "purpose": "Telemetry data processing and feature extraction for racing analysis, including calculations of speed, yaw, coasting time, and event detection.",
  "sources": "Telemetry input dictionaries such as 'WorldPosition_x', 'Throttle', 'Brake', 'SpeedMs', 'CurrentLapTime', etc.",
  "sinks": "Internal storage of computed features and telemetry data; no external network or file operations observed.",
  "flows": "Telemetry data flows from input into internal data structures, then into feature calculations and event detection functions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated method and variable names, complex control flow, redundant conditional variables, which hinder readability but do not indicate malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a telemetry analysis class with multiple feature extraction methods, state tracking variables, and internal data storage. No external network activity, system calls, or malicious payloads are present. Obfuscation is prominent but appears to serve concealment or proprietary protection rather than malicious intent. The logic is consistent and primarily focused on telemetry processing and event detection. No evidence of code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is found. The obfuscation scores are high, justified by the unreadable identifiers, but malware scores are zero, indicating no malicious activity. Security risk scores are low, reflecting the absence of external threats or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate telemetry analysis module with obfuscated identifiers. No malicious activity or malware is detected. Obfuscation is notable but not indicative of malicious intent. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score should be 0.0, with a high obfuscation score (~0.8).",
