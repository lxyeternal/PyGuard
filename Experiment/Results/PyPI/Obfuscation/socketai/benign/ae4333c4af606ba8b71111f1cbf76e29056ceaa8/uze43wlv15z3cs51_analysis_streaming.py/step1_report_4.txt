  "purpose": "The code appears to define a telemetry data processing class for racing analysis, computing various features from telemetry streams such as speed, position, and throttle data.",
  "sources": "Telemetry data inputs from dictionaries, specifically: 'CurrentLapTime', 'WorldPosition_x', 'WorldPosition_y', 'Throttle', 'Brake', 'SpeedMs', 'DistanceRoundTrack'. These are read via telemetry.get() and list append operations.",
  "sinks": "Computed features stored in self.computed_features; no direct data leaks or external actions are evident. No outputs, network calls, or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "Telemetry data is ingested and stored; features are computed through internal methods, with some paths involving calculations from telemetry streams and feature extraction. No external sinks or malicious data flows are detected.",
  "anomalies": "Class and method names are nonsensical and obfuscated (e.g., jnPxpXiqfPAcnSrMgFkQuvRlOAfHPjPG, qEEPooqYHDLebTjnzLXWrMoYAIqfEwKT). There are no apparent security-sensitive operations like system commands, network requests, or data exfiltration. Use of external libraries (pandas, loguru, math) is standard and harmless. The code structure is convoluted but appears to be standard telemetry processing.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with many obfuscated method names and variables, which suggest either intentional obfuscation or auto-generation. It processes telemetry data, calculates features such as lap time differences, position deltas, angles, and rate of change of telemetry parameters. No evidence of malicious behavior such as network communication, system modification, or data exfiltration is present. The obfuscation could be suspicious but does not necessarily imply malicious intent; it might be for code protection or obfuscation. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a telemetry feature extraction module for racing analysis with obfuscated naming. It performs standard calculations without malicious behavior or security risks. No malicious intent or malware signs are evident, but the obfuscation warrants cautious review. Overall security risk is low.",
