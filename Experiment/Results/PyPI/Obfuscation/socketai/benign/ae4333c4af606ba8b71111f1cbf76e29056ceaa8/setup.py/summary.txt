  "security_risk": 0.4,
  "obfuscated": 0.3,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "conclusion": "The setup script contains suspicious but inactive anomalies—an obscure parameter and a hardcoded secret—without evidence of active malware or malicious behavior. The scores are consistent with the analysis, indicating moderate concern primarily due to potential obfuscation and embedded secrets. Further investigation into the broader package context is recommended."
