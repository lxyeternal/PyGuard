  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n- Confirms that the code is a standard setup script with one anomalous parameter: `'rRdQxzvVqQgetMuZoPMZiFRgGZDyPDNh'`.\n- The parameter name is non-standard and suspicious, possibly obfuscated or malicious.\n- The parameter is assigned a string that looks random, but no active malicious actions are observed.\n- Malware score: 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- Security risk: 0.4 (moderate concern due to obfuscation)\n- Confidence: 0.7\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizes the suspicious parameter `'rRdQxzvVqQgetMuZoPMZiFRgGZDyPDNh'`.\n- Rest of the code is standard; no malicious activity.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2 (lower, as no secret or token is clearly present)\n- Confidence: 0.7\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n- Notes a hardcoded string `'uze43wlv15z3cs51'` assigned to a parameter, which could be a secret or token.\n- The parameter `'rRdQxzvVqQgetMuZoPMZiFRgGZDyPDNh'` remains suspicious.\n- No active malicious behavior, but hardcoded secrets are a security concern.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0.4 (due to potential secret leakage)\n- Confidence: 0.7\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n- Similar to above, highlights the suspicious parameter with a random string.\n- No malicious actions, just an unusual parameter.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2\n- Confidence: 0.8\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n- Reiterates the suspicious parameter and the presence of a hardcoded string `'uze43wlv15z3cs51'`.\n- No malicious code, but obfuscation and secrets raise concerns.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0.3\n- Confidence: 0.7\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- **Code presence:** The code is a standard setup script with one or two anomalous parameters.\n- **Malware evidence:** None. No code execution, network activity, or payloads detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** The parameter `'rRdQxzvVqQgetMuZoPMZiFRgGZDyPDNh'` is unusual and likely obfuscated or a placeholder.\n- **Secrets:** The string `'uze43wlv15z3cs51'` could be a secret or token, which is a security concern if embedded in code.\n- **Risks:** The main concern is obfuscation and hardcoded secrets, which could be exploited or indicate malicious intent if misused.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The malware score should remain at **0**, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- The obfuscation score could be increased slightly, perhaps to **0.4**, due to the suspicious parameter name.\n- The overall security risk should be elevated to **0.4–0.5** because of the hardcoded secret and obfuscation.\n- The parameter `'rRdQxzvVqQgetMuZoPMZiFRgGZDyPDNh'` should be scrutinized further; it might be a placeholder or an attempt at obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0.4** (suspicious parameter name)\n- **Risk score:** **0.5** (moderate, due to embedded secrets and obfuscation)\n\n**Note:** The presence of hardcoded secrets and obfuscated parameter names warrants caution but does not confirm malicious activity. Further investigation into the package's source and intent is recommended before deployment or distribution.",
