  "purpose": "Analyze the provided setup.py code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks, focusing on anomalous parameters and hardcoded secrets.",
  "sources": "The parameter 'rRdQxzvVqQgetMuZoPMZiFRgGZDyPDNh' and the string 'uze43wlv15z3cs51' assigned within the setup() call.",
  "sinks": "None directly; potential for secret leakage or misuse if the parameter or string is exploited in broader context.",
  "flows": "The anomalous parameter and secret string are assigned during setup() but do not influence runtime behavior directly; they could be used as hidden configuration or tokens.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a non-standard, obscure parameter 'rRdQxzvVqQgetMuZoPMZiFRgGZDyPDNh' with a random-looking value, and a hardcoded string 'uze43wlv15z3cs51' that may be a secret or token.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script with an unusual parameter name and a hardcoded string. No active malicious code, network activity, or dynamic behavior is present. The suspicious parameter and embedded secret suggest obfuscation or hidden data, but no direct malicious activity is evident. The malware score is 0, reflecting no active malware. The obfuscation score is moderate (~0.3) due to the unusual parameter name. The security risk score is moderate (~0.4) because of the embedded secret and suspicious parameter, which could be exploited if misused. The anomalies warrant further review but do not confirm malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script contains suspicious but inactive anomalies—an obscure parameter and a hardcoded secret—without evidence of active malware or malicious behavior. The scores are consistent with the analysis, indicating moderate concern primarily due to potential obfuscation and embedded secrets. Further investigation into the broader package context is recommended.",
