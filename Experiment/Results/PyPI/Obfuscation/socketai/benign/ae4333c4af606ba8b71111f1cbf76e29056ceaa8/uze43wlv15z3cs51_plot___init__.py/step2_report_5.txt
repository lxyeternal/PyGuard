  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the reported issues, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Issue Confirmed?**  \n  The code is `from .plots import *`, which matches the description.  \n- **Errors/Flaws?**  \n  The report correctly notes that wildcard imports are discouraged but not malicious. No errors in reasoning.  \n- **Scores?**  \n  Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — reasonable, given the minimal risk but noting poor practice.  \n- **Justification for risk score?**  \n  Since this is just an import, the risk is low; the score of 0.2 seems appropriate, acknowledging that wildcard imports can introduce maintenance issues.  \n- **Malware score?**  \n  Correctly 0; no malicious behavior.  \n- **Conclusion:**  \n  Accurate assessment. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Issue Confirmed?**  \n  Same import statement, similar reasoning.  \n- **Errors/Flaws?**  \n  The report emphasizes that the risk depends on the contents of 'plots', which is true.  \n- **Scores?**  \n  Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — consistent with the previous report.  \n- **Justification for risk?**  \n  The risk is minimal unless the module is compromised, which cannot be determined here.  \n- **Malware?**  \n  Correctly 0.  \n- **Conclusion:**  \n  Sound reasoning.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Issue Confirmed?**  \n  The code matches the description.  \n- **Errors/Flaws?**  \n  No; the reasoning is solid.  \n- **Scores?**  \n  Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate, as no malicious activity is evident.  \n- **Justification?**  \n  The import is straightforward; no signs of malicious behavior.  \n- **Malware?**  \n  Correctly 0.  \n- **Conclusion:**  \n  Valid assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Issue Confirmed?**  \n  The code matches.  \n- **Errors/Flaws?**  \n  No; reasoning is consistent.  \n- **Scores?**  \n  Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Justification?**  \n  No malicious activity is indicated.  \n- **Malware?**  \n  Correct.  \n- **Conclusion:**  \n  Sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Issue Confirmed?**  \n  The code matches the description.  \n- **Errors/Flaws?**  \n  No; reasoning aligns with standard practices.  \n- **Scores?**  \n  Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 — acceptable, given the use of wildcard import.  \n- **Justification?**  \n  Slightly higher risk due to the wildcard import, but overall low.  \n- **Malware?**  \n  Correctly 0.  \n- **Conclusion:**  \n  Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- All reports correctly identify that these are simple import statements.  \n- None indicate malicious behavior, obfuscation, or active data flow.  \n- The scores are consistent with the analysis; the only minor point is that wildcard imports are generally discouraged but not inherently dangerous.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 across all reports — no evidence of malicious activity.  \n**Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.  \n**Risk score:** Given the minimal risk associated with these import statements, a conservative estimate would be around 0.1 to 0.2, primarily due to the use of wildcard imports, which can cause maintainability issues but are not malicious.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 — slightly above zero, acknowledging the poor practice but no actual threat.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nThe reports are thorough and accurate. The code snippets are benign, and the scoring aligns well with the security implications.",
