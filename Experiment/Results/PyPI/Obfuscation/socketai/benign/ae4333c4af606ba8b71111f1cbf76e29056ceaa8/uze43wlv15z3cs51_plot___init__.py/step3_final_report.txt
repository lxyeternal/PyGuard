  "purpose": "Import all symbols from a local module named 'plots' using a relative wildcard import.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no external data sources or inputs involved.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; the code only imports symbols into the namespace.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data transfer; import simply loads symbols into the current namespace.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('*') which can lead to namespace pollution and maintenance issues but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward relative import of all symbols from the 'plots' module. There is no code execution, network activity, or data handling. The wildcard import is a poor practice but does not constitute malicious behavior. Without the content of 'plots', we cannot assess if the module itself is malicious, but the import statement alone is benign. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, risk=0.1-0.2, obfuscated=0) are consistent with the benign nature of this code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is safe and does not contain malicious or obfuscated code. The primary concern is the use of wildcard import, which affects code clarity but not security. All reports accurately reflect this assessment. No changes to the scores or analysis are necessary.",
