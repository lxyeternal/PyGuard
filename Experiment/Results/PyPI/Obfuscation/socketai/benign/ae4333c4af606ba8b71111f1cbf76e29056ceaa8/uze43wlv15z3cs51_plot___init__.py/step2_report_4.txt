  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the reported issues with the code, and evaluating the scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the same code: `from .plots import *`\n- This is a relative wildcard import, which is generally discouraged but not inherently malicious.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, malicious code, or data exfiltration is presented.\n- The risk assessments are mostly low, with some noting the potential issues with wildcard imports.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose:** Import all from local 'plots' module.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior; use of wildcard import is questionable but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.8\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The import itself is benign; the concern is more about code clarity.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** Risk depends on 'plots' contents; no malicious behavior in the import statement.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.7\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The report reasonably states that the risk depends on the module content, which isn't provided.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose:** Same.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity; standard relative import.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The confidence is high, and the risk is minimal.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose:** Same.\n- **Analysis:** Benign import, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose:** Same.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity; standard import.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of findings:**\n\n- **Code correctness:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward relative import.\n- **Malware risk:** All reports assign malware=0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** All report 0, which is accurate.\n- **Security risk:** Slight variation, but generally low, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Final evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected or implied)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** Given the minimal risk, a score around 0.1-0.2 is reasonable, considering the wildcard import's potential for confusion but not maliciousness.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — straightforward import.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — minor concern due to wildcard import, but not significant.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The code snippet is benign. The wildcard import is a poor practice but not malicious or risky in this context. No changes needed to the scores or analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:** Always review the contents of the imported module 'plots' for potential malicious code, but based solely on this import statement, there is no security concern.",
