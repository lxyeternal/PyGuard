  "purpose": "Import all components from the local 'plots' module",
  "sources": "The code reads the local 'plots' module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are explicitly present in this single line",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or processing is shown in this snippet",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('*') can be risky as it may hide imported functions or variables, but it is common in certain contexts like plotting scripts; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are visible",
  "analysis": "This code performs a standard import from a local module named 'plots'. There are no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, network communication, or code obfuscation. The use of 'from .plots import *' suggests importing all components from a relative module, which is typical in Python packages for convenience. Without additional code or context, there are no anomalies or malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward import statement with no malicious intent or security risks detected based on this snippet alone.",
