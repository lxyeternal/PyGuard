{
  "purpose": "Import all components from the local 'plots' module, likely for visualization or plotting purposes within the package.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the local 'plots' module file within the same package directory.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present in this single import statement.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis is possible from this single import statement; it only imports code.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses relative import syntax; this is standard in Python packages but may sometimes be used in obfuscated or malicious code to hide dependencies. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward relative import, importing everything (*) from the 'plots' module. It does not perform any actions beyond the import. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity. No hardcoded secrets, environment variable misuse, or obfuscated code are evident. This is typical for a package component that relies on local modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple relative import statement with no malicious intent or security issues. It appears to be part of a larger package structure, and on its own, it poses no security risk.",
