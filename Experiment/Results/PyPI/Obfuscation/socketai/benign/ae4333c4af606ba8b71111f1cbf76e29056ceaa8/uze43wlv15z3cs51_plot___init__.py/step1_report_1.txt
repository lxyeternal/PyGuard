  "purpose": "Import all contents from the local module 'plots' within the same package.",
  "sources": "Import statement that loads the entire 'plots' module from the current package.",
  "sinks": "Potentially any functions or variables imported from 'plots' could be used as sinks if they process untrusted data, but the import itself does not directly constitute a sink.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; this is an import statement and does not involve data flow from source to sink.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('*') can be considered an anomaly as it reduces code clarity and may import unintended or malicious code if the module is compromised, but on its own, it is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports all functions, classes, or variables from a local module named 'plots'. This is a standard Python import statement. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as executing code, network communication, or handling sensitive data. The use of wildcard import is a questionable practice but not inherently malicious. No additional context or code is provided to evaluate further behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard import of a local module using a wildcard. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident from this single statement. However, the use of wildcard import is generally discouraged for clarity and maintainability.",
