  "purpose": "Import all functions, classes, or variables from the 'plots' module in the same package.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no runtime data input or external data reading in this line.",
  "sinks": "The import process, which could potentially load malicious or tampered code if the 'plots' module is compromised or maliciously modified.",
  "flows": "Not applicable here as this is a static import statement; no runtime data flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a wildcard import ('*') is generally discouraged as it can lead to unclear namespace pollution, but it is not inherently malicious. No signs of obfuscated code or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single import statement using a relative import syntax. It imports everything from a sibling module named 'plots'. There are no apparent malicious behaviors, hidden code, or suspicious patterns. Since this is only an import statement, the risk depends on the contents of the 'plots' module, which is not provided. The code itself does not perform any malicious actions or data manipulations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import statement with no immediate malicious behavior. Its security risk depends entirely on the contents of the 'plots' module, which is not available for review. The use of a wildcard import is considered poor practice but not malicious.",
