{
  "purpose": "The code loads the Iris dataset from a public URL, converts class labels to categorical codes, and performs a custom clustering algorithm similar to k-means with multiple random initializations and iterative refinement.",
  "sources": "Reads dataset from URL, accesses class labels and features, and uses random choice for initial centroids.",
  "sinks": "Outputs predicted labels and ground truth labels via print statements; no data leaks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Dataset loaded -> labels processed -> clustering performed -> labels printed.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are heavily obfuscated; clustering logic is complex and convoluted, but no malicious code or network activity is present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard clustering on the Iris dataset with obfuscated variable names, which could be a red flag but is not inherently malicious. No network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications are detected. The obfuscation appears to be primarily variable naming, not malicious behavior. The clustering implementation is complex but aligns with legitimate data analysis routines. The malware score is 0, as no malicious actions are evident. The obfuscation score is moderate (around 0.6) due to variable naming complexity. The security risk score is low (around 0.2), reflecting the benign nature of the code. Overall, the code is a complex but benign clustering implementation with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a complex, obfuscated clustering routine on the Iris dataset, with no evidence of malware or malicious activity. The obfuscation is notable but not malicious. Scores are consistent with the analysis, and the overall security risk is low.",
