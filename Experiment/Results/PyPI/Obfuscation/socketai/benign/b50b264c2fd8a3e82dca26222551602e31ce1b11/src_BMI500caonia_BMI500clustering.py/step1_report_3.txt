{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform a clustering analysis on the Iris dataset using a custom implementation of the k-means algorithm.",
  "sources": "Reads data from an external URL ('https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data') and loads it into a pandas DataFrame.",
  "sinks": "Print statements at the end output prediction and ground truth labels, which are non-sensitive data; no data leaks or untrusted data handling are evident.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded from the URL (source), processed, and used in the clustering function; the function's output is printed without external influence.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors such as dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets are present. The variable names are non-descriptive but do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script loads the Iris dataset from a publicly available source, assigns categorical labels, and converts them to numeric codes. It defines a custom k-means clustering function with multiple random initializations and iterative refinement, finally comparing predicted cluster assignments to actual labels. No network communication beyond the initial data fetch, no code injection, or system modification is evident. The code solely performs clustering and prints results, consistent with legitimate data analysis tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data analysis script performing clustering on a public dataset. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected. It simply loads data, processes it, performs clustering, and outputs predictions. Variable naming is obscure but does not indicate malicious intent.",
