  "purpose": "The code appears to perform data processing, possibly related to network communication or data analysis, but no explicit purpose can be definitively determined from the given snippet.",
  "sources": "Data is read from variables, possibly user inputs or external data sources such as files or network streams.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, network transmission functions, or data storage points where untrusted data could be mishandled.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs or external data) through processing functions, potentially reaching sinks where data is output or transmitted.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns detected. No obfuscated code or unusual language features observed. The code uses standard Python constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code does not contain obvious malicious functions such as network connections to suspicious domains, data exfiltration, or backdoors. It mainly performs data manipulation. There is no evidence of code injection, unsafe SQL, or insecure environment variable use. The lack of external API calls or network activity reduces suspicion. However, without knowing the exact data sources or full context, some uncertainty remains.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with no signs of malware, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. Confidence in this assessment is high, given the limited scope and standard structure.",
