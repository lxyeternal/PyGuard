  "conclusion": "Most code snippets are benign with low security risk; however, reports 4 and 5 display significant obfuscation and suspicious behaviors, warranting higher malware and risk scores. The assessments are consistent with the evidence, and no adjustments are strictly necessary, though marginal increases in scores for reports 4 and 5 could improve accuracy."
