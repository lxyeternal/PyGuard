  "purpose": "Standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project, reading README.md and defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file, static string variables for metadata, dependencies list, and package discovery.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or environment variable operations that could lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file read into variables, then into setuptools.setup() parameters; no dynamic or untrusted data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, inconsistent parameter naming, and syntax irregularities (e.g., '=' signs in dictionary keys) that could cause execution errors or suggest obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with obfuscated variable names, which may be an attempt at concealment. No malicious code, network activity, or payloads are present. Syntax irregularities could be formatting issues or intentional obfuscation. The dependencies are standard. The obfuscation does not imply malicious intent but warrants caution. No signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign setup script with obfuscated variable names. No malicious activity or security vulnerabilities are detected. The obfuscation is likely for concealment but does not constitute a threat. The malware score is 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2).",
