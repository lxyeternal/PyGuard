{
  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python project with metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file; hardcoded strings for email and URL; package dependencies listed in code.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no use of untrusted input or data flows that could lead to data leaks or code execution.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external untrusted sources to sinks; static data is used for configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, unusual variable naming, and encoding style; no dynamic code execution or suspicious logic found.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a README file with a variable name that appears obfuscated but simply stores the file content. The setup() call uses hardcoded strings for email and URL, which are typical in package metadata. No user input, network data, or untrusted data sources are used. Dependencies are statically listed. No indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious logic are present. Variable names may appear obfuscated but are benign and only serve as placeholders.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with obfuscated variable names that do not affect behavior. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
