  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code execution points, data input/output, dynamic code features, environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, system modifications, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources leading to sinks via function calls, dynamic execution, or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, dynamic code execution, unusual imports, or hidden network activity.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate low suspicion, with some noting dynamic features or obfuscation. Scores for malware (0.0-0.2) and obfuscation (0-0.4) are consistent with descriptions. Confidence levels are appropriate, reflecting limited code context. No concrete malicious activity is observed; suspicion is primarily due to opacity or dynamic code. The security risk scores (0.2-0.3) align with the analysis, indicating low but cautious concern. Overall, the assessments are coherent and justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with minor concerns about dynamic features and obfuscation in some reports. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No significant adjustments are necessary; continued monitoring is recommended.",
