{
  "purpose": "Evaluate supply chain security of the open source dependency by analyzing code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, network communication, dynamic imports, eval/exec, hardcoded addresses, complex constructs.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, dynamic code execution, data exfiltration points, file operations, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables and untrusted input flow into dynamic execution, network transmission, or data handling points.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval, exec, dynamic imports, hardcoded network addresses, complex or obfuscated code patterns, suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation through dynamic imports and eval, with suspicious network activity indicating potential data exfiltration or command and control. The presence of hardcoded addresses and complex constructs further suggest malicious intent. The scores reflect moderate suspicion, with malware likelihood around 0.5, obfuscation at 0.6, and security risk at 0.6, consistent with observed behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency shows signs of obfuscation and suspicious network activity, indicating a moderate to high security risk. While definitive malicious payloads are not confirmed, the patterns warrant caution and further dynamic/static analysis.",
