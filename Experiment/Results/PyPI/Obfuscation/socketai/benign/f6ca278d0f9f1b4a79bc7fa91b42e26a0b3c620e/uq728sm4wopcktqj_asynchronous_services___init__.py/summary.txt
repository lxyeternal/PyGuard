  "conclusion": "The overall assessment indicates low to moderate malicious potential primarily driven by dynamic code features. The scores are justified and aligned with the evidence. Slightly increasing malware scores for reports 3 and 4 to 0.4 could better reflect the suspicion level, but current scores are acceptable. The risk scores appropriately capture the potential vulnerabilities. No false positives or overestimations are evident; continued monitoring is recommended if code patterns persist."
