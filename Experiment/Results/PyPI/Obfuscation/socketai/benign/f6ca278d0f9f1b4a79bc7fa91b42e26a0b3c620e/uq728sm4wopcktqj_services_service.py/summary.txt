  "conclusion": "The code is a request/response logging and masking utility, likely used for security auditing or debugging. Despite heavy obfuscation and extensive logging, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The primary concern is potential data exposure through logs and concealment tactics, which warrants caution but does not constitute malicious activity. The overall security risk is moderate, mainly due to obfuscation and sensitive data handling, but the malware score remains at 0. The code should be monitored further if integrated into larger systems, especially regarding external inputs and logging practices."
