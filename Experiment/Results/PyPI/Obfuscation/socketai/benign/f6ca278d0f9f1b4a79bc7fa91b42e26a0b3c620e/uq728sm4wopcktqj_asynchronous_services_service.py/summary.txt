  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation and dynamic resource handling, which are red flags for potential malicious activity. However, no concrete evidence of malware or malicious payloads is present. The suspicious patterns justify cautious scoring, but the lack of definitive malicious indicators suggests the code is not malicious per se. Further dynamic analysis or sandbox testing is recommended to confirm behavior."
