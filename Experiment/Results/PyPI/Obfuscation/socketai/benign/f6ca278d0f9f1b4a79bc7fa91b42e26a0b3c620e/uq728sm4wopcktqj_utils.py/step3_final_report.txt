  "purpose": "A utility function to mask specified fields in a dictionary for privacy or data anonymization.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'nOfPZfJcbzPiouXGcQqvpyXJuaJqOHgC' (possibly external data), 'fields' list.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; the function modifies the input dictionary locally.",
  "flows": "Source: input dictionary; Sink: modified dictionary with masked fields.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated variable names; no malicious code or data leaks present.",
  "analysis": "The function checks if the input is a dict, creates a shallow copy, then iterates over specified fields, replacing their values with a mask string. No external data access, network activity, or code execution occurs. Variable names are nonsensical but do not indicate malicious intent. The code is straightforward and benign, serving as a data masking utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward data masking function with obfuscated variable names. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The high obfuscation score is justified by variable naming, but the overall security risk remains minimal. The malware score is zero, and the risk score should be set accordingly.",
