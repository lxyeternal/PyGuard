  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code reads environment variables, files, command-line arguments, and performs data processing; no external inputs or suspicious operations detected.",
  "sinks": "Potential data flows to network, files, or system commands, but no actual malicious activity observed.",
  "flows": "Sources (environment variables, files, args) to sinks (network, files, commands), with no evidence of malicious data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns; code is straightforward and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets across all reports are simple, performing basic operations such as random number generation, environment variable reading, and data handling. No external inputs are used maliciously, no network connections or data exfiltration observed. Scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No obfuscation or malicious intent detected. The low security risk scores reflect cautious acknowledgment of dynamic features but do not indicate actual threats.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency is safe, with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal and scores are appropriate. No further action required.",
