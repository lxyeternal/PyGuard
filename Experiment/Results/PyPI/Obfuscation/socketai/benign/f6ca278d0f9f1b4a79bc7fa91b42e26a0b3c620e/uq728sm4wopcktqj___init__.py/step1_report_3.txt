  "purpose": "The code appears to initialize some variables, import modules, and perform basic operations, but no clear purpose is explicitly stated.",
  "sources": "Potential data sources include environment variables, user input, and imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are network calls, file writes, or system commands, but none are explicitly present in the provided code.",
  "flows": "No evident data flow from untrusted sources to critical functions or sinks is observable in the provided snippet.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, suspicious function calls, or obfuscated code segments. The code structure is straightforward, with standard imports and variable assignments.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of initial imports and variable definitions without any apparent malicious logic. No network connections, data exfiltration, or malicious system modifications are evident. Lack of suspicious patterns or anomalies suggests benign intent. Due to the limited scope and absence of external data handling or sensitive operations, the code appears to be a standard, harmless script.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no indication of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems to perform basic operations without any malicious intent. Confidence in this assessment is high, given the straightforward nature of the code.",
