{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple utility for generating and printing a random number, likely for application purposes such as tokens, IDs, or random delays.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from the 'random' module, specifically using 'random.randint()' to generate a number.",
  "sinks": "The output is printed to standard output using 'print()', which is a normal operation and does not directly pose a security risk.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves importing the 'random' module, generating a random integer between specified bounds, and printing the result. There are no untrusted data flows involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'random' module, generates a random integer within a specified range, and outputs it. The code is simple, with no external inputs, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated sections. It does not interact with network, file system, or environment variables. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign operation involving random number generation and output. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security threats. Overall, the code appears safe.",
