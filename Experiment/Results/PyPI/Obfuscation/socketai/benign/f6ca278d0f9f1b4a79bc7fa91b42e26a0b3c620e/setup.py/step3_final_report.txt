  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging, reading README.md and defining dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' into a variable; no untrusted input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as network calls, code execution, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Reading file -> setup() call with metadata; no untrusted data flows to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; no malicious code or suspicious operations detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with obfuscated variable names, which could be superficial or stylistic. No network activity, code injection, or malicious behavior is present. The dependencies are common and benign. The obfuscation alone does not indicate malicious intent, and the code does not perform any harmful actions. The scores from reports align with this assessment, assigning a malware score of 0 and a high obfuscation score (~0.75). The low security risk score (~0.2) is appropriate given the benign nature of the code. No evidence suggests supply chain compromise or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup script with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. The obfuscation is suspicious but not malicious. The malware score should remain at 0, the obfuscated score around 0.75, and the overall risk low (~0.2). Continued vigilance is recommended if additional code or context is available.",
