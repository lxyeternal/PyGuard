{
  "purpose": "The code constructs various report URL templates and configuration strings based on input parameters, primarily serving as a static data utility for report access.",
  "sources": "Function parameters (frequency, report_type, country), and internal dictionaries containing static mappings and string templates.",
  "sinks": "The function returns constructed URL strings; no network or system modifications are performed within this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Input parameters influence string formatting; the constructed URLs or keys are returned directly without further processing or external actions.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are heavily obfuscated, and some references (e.g., 'BPS_COUNTRIES_DICT', 'freq') are undefined within the snippet, indicating incomplete context. No malicious code or dynamic execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static utility generating URL or configuration strings based on predefined templates and input parameters. Obfuscation is superficial, mainly through variable naming, with no signs of malicious activity such as network calls, data exfiltration, or code injection. The function relies on external dependencies or incomplete snippets, but within this context, it appears benign. The absence of network activity, dynamic code execution, or data leaks suggests low security concern. The high obfuscation level is superficial and does not imply malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static URL/template generator with superficial obfuscation and no malicious behavior. It poses minimal security risk, and the observed obfuscation does not indicate malicious sabotage. The scores assigned in the original reports are appropriate; malware is 0, security risk is low (~0.2), and obfuscation is moderate (~0.6-0.7).",
