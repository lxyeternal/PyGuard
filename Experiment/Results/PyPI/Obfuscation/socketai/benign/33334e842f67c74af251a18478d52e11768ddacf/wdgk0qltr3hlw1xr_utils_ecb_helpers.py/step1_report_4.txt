  "purpose": "Asynchronous function to fetch and filter data from ECB API based on date ranges.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: series_id (implied), QRqGgadpwdZPJqlKJqWmgXcYpVuwyvKT, UymikJpdkgFJUEwcVkDxmQmfKrVLdwMF; Data fetched via amake_request function from external API.",
  "sinks": "Data filtering operations on the fetched JSON data; no direct data leaks or insecure operations are evident.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are sanitized by removing dashes, then used to construct API URL and request payload. Fetched data is filtered based on date ranges provided by the user.",
  "anomalies": "Potentially undefined variable 'series_id' used in URL construction without prior definition, which could lead to runtime errors but not malicious activity. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behaviors are present. Code structure is straightforward. No obfuscated code detected. The only unusual aspect is the undefined variable 'series_id'.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an async function that imports modules within the function scope, which is acceptable. It sanitizes input parameters by removing dashes, constructs a URL with an undefined variable 'series_id', and makes an asynchronous request. The response is parsed and filtered based on date ranges. Error handling is in place for keyboard interruption and JSON decoding errors. No malicious data handling, backdoors, or suspicious external communications are present. The undefined 'series_id' appears to be an oversight rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs data retrieval and filtering with no clear malicious intent. The main concern is the use of an undefined variable 'series_id', which indicates a likely bug rather than malicious activity. No malware or supply chain attack signals are evident.",
