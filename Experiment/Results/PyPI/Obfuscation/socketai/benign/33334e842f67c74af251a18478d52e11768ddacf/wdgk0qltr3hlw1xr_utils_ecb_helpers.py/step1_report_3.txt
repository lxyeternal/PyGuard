  "purpose": "Fetch and filter data from ECB API based on provided date ranges.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: QRqGgadpwdZPJqlKJqWmgXcYpVuwyvKT, UymikJpdkgFJUEwcVkDxmQmfKrVLdwMF; external API call to ECB data endpoint.",
  "sinks": "The API request sends data; JSON response is processed locally. No direct data leakage points identified.",
  "flows": "Input parameters processed to modify date strings; API request made with these parameters; JSON response filtered based on date ranges.",
  "anomalies": "Potential undefined variable 'series_id' used in URL construction without assignment; use of dynamic data filtering based on response content. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs an asynchronous data fetch from an ECB API endpoint, dynamically constructs a URL (but references an undefined variable 'series_id' which may cause runtime errors), then filters the response data based on date ranges provided as input. The filtering logic compares 'PERIOD' field with input date strings. No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected. The key concern is the undefined variable that could cause operational issues but not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is intended for legitimate data retrieval and filtering. No evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. The undefined variable 'series_id' suggests incomplete code or a bug, but not malicious intent.",
