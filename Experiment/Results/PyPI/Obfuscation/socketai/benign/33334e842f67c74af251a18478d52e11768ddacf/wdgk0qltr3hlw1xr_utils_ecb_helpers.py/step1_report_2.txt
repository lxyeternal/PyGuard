  "purpose": "Fetch and filter data from ECB API based on provided date range parameters.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: hQDLyRUOQOdQLOixiQwcoWVyKPjxehFO, QRqGgadpwdZPJqlKJqWmgXcYpVuwyvKT, UymikJpdkgFJUEwcVkDxmQmfKrVLdwMF; External API request to https://data.ecb.europa.eu/data-detail-api/{series_id}.",
  "sinks": "Data returned from amake_request function, filtered and processed within the code.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are sanitized, used in API request; API response is filtered based on date filters; final data returned.",
  "anomalies": "Use of variable 'series_id' which is not defined anywhere in the code; potential bug or malicious intent to manipulate the request URL. The code performs data filtering based on date parameters, but the variable 'series_id' is undefined, which could lead to unexpected behavior or be exploited for malicious purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an asynchronous function that constructs a URL with an undefined variable 'series_id', which could lead to a malformed URL or an injection point if manipulated. It imports JSON and custom modules, then sanitizes input parameters by removing dashes. It attempts an API request via 'amake_request' and handles specific exceptions, re-raising KeyboardInterrupt and wrapping JSONDecodeError as a custom error. After receiving data, it filters the response based on date ranges, but due to the undefined 'series_id', the request URL may be invalid or maliciously manipulated. No evident obfuscation or malicious code like network exfiltration or backdoors is present, but the undefined variable and reliance on external functions pose security concerns. The variable 'series_id' appears to be a placeholder or missing implementation detail, which might be exploited if manipulated or could cause runtime errors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is intended for data retrieval and filtering from an external API. The critical issue is the use of an undefined variable 'series_id' in the URL construction, which indicates a bug or potential manipulation point. No explicit malicious behaviors or malware are detected, but this bug could be exploited or cause unintended effects. Overall, the code appears to be standard data-fetching logic with a significant implementation flaw rather than malicious intent.",
