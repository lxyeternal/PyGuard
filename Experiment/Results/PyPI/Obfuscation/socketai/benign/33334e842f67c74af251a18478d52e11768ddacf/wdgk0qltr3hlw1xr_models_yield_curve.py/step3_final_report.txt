{
  "purpose": "The code fetches yield curve data from ECB, utilizing caching and data transformation for analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters for yield curve type, cache flag, and data from external APIs and configuration functions.",
  "sinks": "Processes data in-memory; no direct data leaks or system effects observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters influence data fetching; fetched data flows through validation and transformation functions into structured output.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation in variable names and string literals; complex async logic with base64-encoded strings and dynamic URL construction.",
  "analysis": "The code performs data retrieval and processing with significant obfuscation, which raises suspicion. No evidence of malicious actions such as data exfiltration, system modification, or network malicious activity is present. The obfuscation could be used to conceal malicious intent, but based on the visible logic, it appears to be a legitimate data fetching module. The use of async requests, caching, and data validation aligns with standard practices, albeit obscured.",
  "conclusion": "The code is likely a legitimate data fetching and processing module with high obfuscation. There is no direct evidence of malicious behavior, but the obfuscation warrants cautious review, especially in sensitive environments. Malware score is set to 0.3 to reflect suspicion due to obfuscation, and overall security risk is moderate (0.4).",
