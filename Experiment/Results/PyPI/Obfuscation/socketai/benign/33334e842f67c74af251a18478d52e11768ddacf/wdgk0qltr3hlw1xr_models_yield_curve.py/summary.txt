  "conclusion": "The code is likely a legitimate data fetching and processing module with high obfuscation. There is no direct evidence of malicious behavior, but the obfuscation warrants cautious review, especially in sensitive environments. Malware score is set to 0.3 to reflect suspicion due to obfuscation, and overall security risk is moderate (0.4)."
