{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a standard Python script performing data processing or utility functions, with no explicit malicious intent observed.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function arguments, environment variables, or files, depending on specific code segments not provided here.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, file writes, or execution functions, though no suspicious activity such as data exfiltration or remote code execution was detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as user input or environment variables to sinks like file or network operations, but no anomalous flow patterns were identified.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic were detected. The code does not contain obfuscated language features or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code appears well-structured with standard Python practices. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. Usage of third-party libraries seems legitimate, and no insecure patterns like SQL injection, unsafe eval, or data leaks are observed. The code lacks suspicious network activity or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a typical utility script with standard data handling practices. The overall security risk is low.",
