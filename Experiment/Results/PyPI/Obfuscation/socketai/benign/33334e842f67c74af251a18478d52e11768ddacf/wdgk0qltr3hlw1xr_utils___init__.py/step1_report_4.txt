{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform data processing and possibly interacts with external sources or user input, but the exact purpose is unclear due to lack of context.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the user via the 'input()' function and may also read environment variables or configuration files (not explicitly shown).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file operations, or execution of commands (not explicitly shown).",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions, potentially reaching sinks such as network or file system operations.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials or malicious obfuscation are detected. Unusual patterns include dynamic code execution or suspicious imports, but none are evident here.",
  "analysis": "The code includes standard Python functions, possibly for data handling. Without explicit external calls or malicious patterns, no malicious behavior is apparent. The structure suggests typical application logic without indicators of sabotage or malware. No obfuscated code or malicious payloads identified.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with standard data processing operations. However, due to limited context and absence of external interactions, some risks cannot be fully ruled out.",
