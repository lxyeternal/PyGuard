  "confidence": 0.85,
  "conclusion": "Most code samples are benign, with reports 3 and 5 indicating moderate suspicion due to obfuscation and dynamic features. The scores are generally consistent with the described behaviors. Slightly increasing malware suspicion in report 5 could better reflect the potential risk, but current assessments are reasonable."
