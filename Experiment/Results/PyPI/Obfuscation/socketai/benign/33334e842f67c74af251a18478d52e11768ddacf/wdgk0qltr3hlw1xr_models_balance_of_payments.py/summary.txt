  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate data fetching and processing module with heavy obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious activity or payloads. The high obfuscation score reflects the difficulty in understanding the code, warranting cautious review, especially of external dependencies. Overall, the security risk remains low, but ongoing monitoring and validation of external functions are recommended."
