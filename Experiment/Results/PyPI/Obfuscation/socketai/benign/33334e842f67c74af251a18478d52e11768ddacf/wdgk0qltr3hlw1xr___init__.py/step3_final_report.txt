  "purpose": "Initialize a Provider object with ECB data models and static configuration parameters.",
  "sources": "Static variable assignments, import statements, hardcoded strings and URLs.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input, no network communication, no data leaks or code execution points.",
  "flows": "Imports -> Provider instantiation with static data and models.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names and string literals, likely auto-generated or placeholder identifiers.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static imports and a Provider object creation with hardcoded parameters. No dynamic input, network activity, or code execution is present. The obfuscated variable names and strings are suspicious but are typical of auto-generated code or placeholders, not necessarily malicious. The absence of secrets, network calls, or code injection points indicates a benign configuration script. The high obfuscation score reflects the variable naming but does not imply malicious intent. Malware score is zero, and security risk is minimal, consistent with a static setup. The overall structure and content do not exhibit malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a static configuration with obfuscated identifiers that are likely auto-generated. No evidence of malicious activity, data exfiltration, or security vulnerabilities is present. The assigned scores are appropriate, with high obfuscation due to variable naming but no malicious intent. Overall, the supply chain security risk is very low.",
