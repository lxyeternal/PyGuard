  "purpose": "This source code appears to be a simple utility script that performs data processing and outputs results. It is intended for local execution and does not contain obvious malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Data is read from function inputs, local variables, and possibly external files or network resources if included, but no explicit external data sources are evident from the provided code.",
  "sinks": "Data outputs via print statements or file writes, if any, but none are explicitly shown. No untrusted data sinks like network connections or file writes are clearly present.",
  "flows": "Input data is processed through internal functions and variables, with no indication of data flowing to external untrusted systems or malicious sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscation, or unusual code constructs are present. The code is straightforward with no apparent anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code's structure and content suggest it performs standard data processing tasks. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors. Usage of third-party libraries is not suspicious and appears typical. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present. Overall, the code seems benign and consistent with normal application logic.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet. It appears to be a standard, safe utility script with no evident indicators of malware or security vulnerabilities.",
