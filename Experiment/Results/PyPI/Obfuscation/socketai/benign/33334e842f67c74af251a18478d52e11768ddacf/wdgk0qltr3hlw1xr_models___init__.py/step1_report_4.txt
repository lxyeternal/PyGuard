{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly clear due to the lack of comments and context, but it appears to be a Python module intended for data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function parameters, local variables, and possibly external inputs if invoked with untrusted arguments.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, file operations, or execution of dynamic code, if present. Specific sinks are not evident from the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions and potentially to output or external systems like files or networks.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are visible. Lack of comments makes intent unclear, but the structure appears typical.",
  "analysis": "The code fragment is minimal and primarily consists of standard function definitions and variable assignments. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The absence of external or untrusted data handling in the visible code limits the scope of potential threats. Without further context or actual runtime behavior, it appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems to be standard utility functions with no suspicious elements.",
