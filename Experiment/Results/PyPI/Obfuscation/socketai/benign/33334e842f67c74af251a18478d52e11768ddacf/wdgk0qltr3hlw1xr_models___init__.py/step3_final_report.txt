  "sources": "Environment variables, imported modules, input functions, configuration files, function parameters, local variables.",
  "sinks": "Network functions, file operations, subprocess calls, logs, print statements, data transmission, environment variables.",
  "flows": "Data from sources (env vars, input, config) into code logic, potentially reaching sinks via function calls or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic execution (eval/exec), obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, redundant or suspicious code patterns, convoluted logic, network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution in suspicious reports, with some containing hardcoded secrets or network activity, indicating potential malicious intent. Benign reports lack suspicious patterns and show straightforward logic. Scores assigned reflect the level of suspicion: high in reports with obfuscation and dangerous functions, moderate where obfuscation exists but no concrete malicious activity, and low or zero in benign cases. The reasoning aligns with typical security assessment standards, and the scores are consistent with the described code features.",
  "conclusion": "The assessments are well-founded; Report 1 shows strong indicators of malicious behavior with high malware and risk scores justified by obfuscation and dangerous functions. Report 2's moderate scores are appropriate given the obfuscation but lack of confirmed malicious payloads. Reports 3, 4, and 5 are benign, with scores reflecting their straightforward or absent code. Minor adjustments could include slightly lowering the malware score for Report 2 to 0.2-0.3 for better accuracy, but overall, the scores are consistent and justified.",
