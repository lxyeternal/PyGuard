{
  "purpose": "The code appears to generate a dictionary of formatted string identifiers based on input parameters, likely for use in financial or rating systems.",
  "sources": "The code reads constant dictionaries and lists defined at the beginning; no external input is read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are evident; no data is written to external systems or network connections.",
  "flows": "Data flows from predefined constants and input parameters (rating and yield curve type) into formatted string constructions within the function.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains numerous obfuscated variable names and dynamic string formatting that could be used to mask malicious intent. However, the actual logic is straightforward string formatting without external calls or data manipulations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple constant dictionaries and a list, then a function that constructs a dictionary of formatted strings based on input parameters with default values. The formatting strings embed variables from other dictionaries, which are presumably intended for creating specific identifiers or keys. The function also returns a secondary dictionary with numerical values mapped to string keys, possibly representing maturities or durations. No external data sources, network calls, or file operations are present. The obfuscation mainly lies in variable naming, which appears designed to obscure the purpose but does not indicate malicious activity. There are no indications of data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, albeit obfuscated, string formatting utility for generating identifiers based on rating and yield type inputs. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The obfuscation seems intentional for hiding purpose but does not translate into harmful actions.",
