  "purpose": "Generate a dictionary of financial series identifiers and associated parameters based on input ratings and yield curve types.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to the function (rating and yield curve type). Uses predefined constants and dictionaries for string formatting.",
  "sinks": "The function constructs and returns a dictionary with formatted strings; no untrusted data handling or external communication present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> String formatting with dictionary lookups -> Return of a dictionary with constructed strings and numeric values.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code solely generates and returns formatted strings and numeric mappings.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constant dictionaries and lists for financial data labels and time periods. The function 'JbUDUAQVLEinPhjUptuBzwxdJNrcAdju' takes two optional string parameters with default values, uses these parameters to generate formatted string identifiers based on predefined mappings (RATING_DICT and YIELD_TYPE_DICT), and returns a dictionary with these identifiers and numeric values associated with each period. There are no external data sources, network communication, or secret handling. The structure appears consistent with a typical data formatting utility, with no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for generating financial series identifiers based on input parameters. It contains no malware, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a straightforward data formatting function with no suspicious or malicious intent.",
