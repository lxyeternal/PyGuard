  "purpose": "Generate a dictionary of financial series identifiers based on rating and yield curve type parameters.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'rating' and 'yield_curve_type'; external dictionaries 'RATING_DICT' and 'YIELD_TYPE_DICT' (not provided).",
  "sinks": "Formatted string identifiers within the returned dictionary.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> String formatting using external dictionaries -> Output dictionary with identifiers.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; reliance on undefined external dictionaries 'RATING_DICT' and 'YIELD_TYPE_DICT'.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a set of formatted string identifiers for different maturities based on input rating and yield curve type. It uses external dictionaries for string substitution, which are not included, potentially causing runtime errors. The variable names are intentionally obfuscated, but the logic is straightforward string formatting without external data access, network calls, or security-sensitive operations. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are present. The code appears to be a utility for generating identifiers, with the main concern being the missing dependencies and obfuscation, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for generating formatted financial identifiers. No malicious activity or security risks are evident. The obfuscation and missing dependencies could cause runtime errors but do not indicate malicious behavior.",
