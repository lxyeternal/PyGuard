{
  "purpose": "The code appears to generate a dictionary of string identifiers for financial yield curves based on input parameters, likely used for constructing or referencing financial data series.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters 'YVGeMzACLuXjsvnNCmTRFITMqacfoMDP' and 'MvKnCDBqLpOKvZHkOeGMXWQfjBpjeEuN' which have default values and are used to determine key strings in the output.",
  "sinks": "The function outputs a dictionary containing formatted string identifiers. These are not sinks in the security sense but rather data labels or keys.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into the formation of string templates, which then populate the returned dictionary of series identifiers.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious code behaviors such as network activity, file operations, or system manipulation are present. The code constructs strings dynamically but only for data labeling purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple constants and a function that constructs strings based on input parameters and predefined dictionaries. The strings seem to follow a specific naming convention, probably for referencing data series. No external data is fetched, no files are accessed, and there is no suspicious dynamic execution or obfuscated code. The variables are used for string formatting, not for executing code or handling untrusted input in a harmful way. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward utility for generating identifiers. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard data identifier generator for financial series and contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It simply constructs formatted string keys based on input parameters. No suspicious or malicious activity detected.",
