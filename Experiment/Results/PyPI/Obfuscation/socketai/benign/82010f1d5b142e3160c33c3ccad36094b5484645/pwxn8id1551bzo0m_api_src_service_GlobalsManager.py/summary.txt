  "conclusion": "The code is a high-risk utility characterized by obfuscation, dynamic module/resource management, and subprocess execution without input validation. While explicit malicious payloads are not evident, its architecture poses substantial security risks if inputs are manipulated. It warrants strict input validation, refactoring for clarity, and cautious deployment in security-sensitive contexts."
