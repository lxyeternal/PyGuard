  "confidence": 0.75,
  "conclusion": "The code snippet shows high obfuscation but no active malicious activity. The suspicion due to obfuscation warrants further review of the actual implementation. Current scores are appropriate; no immediate threat is confirmed. Continued analysis of the full codebase is recommended to ensure no concealed malicious logic exists."
