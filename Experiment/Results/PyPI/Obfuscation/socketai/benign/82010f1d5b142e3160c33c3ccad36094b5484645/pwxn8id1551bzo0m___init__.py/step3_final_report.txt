  "purpose": "Assess the provided Python import code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'globals.api.src.service.GlobalsManager' with obfuscated identifiers.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network calls, file writes, or data leaks are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No active data or control flow; only static imports with obfuscated names.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of variable and function names, with no visible implementation logic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with highly obfuscated identifiers, which can be a tactic to conceal malicious code. No malicious activity, network communication, or data processing is evident. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.2, obfuscated ~0.8, risk ~0.3) are consistent with this analysis. Further investigation should focus on the implementation of 'GlobalsManager' and its members to rule out hidden malicious logic. The cautious approach is appropriate given the obfuscation, but current evidence does not demonstrate active malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet shows high obfuscation but no active malicious activity. The suspicion due to obfuscation warrants further review of the actual implementation. Current scores are appropriate; no immediate threat is confirmed. Continued analysis of the full codebase is recommended to ensure no concealed malicious logic exists.",
