{
  "purpose": "The code appears to invoke a testing helper module to run some tests related to the current script file.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'TestHelper' from 'python_helper' and calls 'TestHelper.run()' with the current filename.",
  "sinks": "The 'TestHelper.run()' function may execute code or perform tests that could potentially involve untrusted input or data, depending on its implementation.",
  "flows": "Input source: __file__ (the current script filename). Output sink: 'TestHelper.run()' execution, which may process the current file's data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. The code relies entirely on an external helper library, which is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a helper module and executes a run method, passing in the current filename and specific parameters. The structure is minimal, with no evident malicious code or data leakage mechanisms visible in this snippet. The behavior depends on the implementation of 'TestHelper.run()', which is external and not shown. No suspicious data flows or anomalies are apparent directly in this code.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this code snippet, there are no indications of malicious behavior. It functions as a test harness invocation, with no evident security risks or malware present.",
