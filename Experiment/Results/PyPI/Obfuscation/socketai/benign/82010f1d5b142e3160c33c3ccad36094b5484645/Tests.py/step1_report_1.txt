  "purpose": "To run tests using the TestHelper module from the python_helper package on the current file.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'python_helper' package; invocation of 'TestHelper.run()' with the current filename as an argument.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks identified; the run() method may internally handle data, but nothing suspicious is evident in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Import of 'TestHelper' from the package, followed by execution of 'TestHelper.run()' with the current script as input.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code behaviors are apparent. The usage appears standard for a testing utility.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a testing helper library and executes its run() method on the current script. No input/output sources or sinks are exposed directly; the function's internal behavior is unknown, but based on the code, there is no evident malicious activity. The code does not perform network operations, data exfiltration, or system modifications explicitly. It appears to be a standard test invocation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward test invocation using a helper library. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident from this snippet. It appears to be safe and typical for testing purposes.",
