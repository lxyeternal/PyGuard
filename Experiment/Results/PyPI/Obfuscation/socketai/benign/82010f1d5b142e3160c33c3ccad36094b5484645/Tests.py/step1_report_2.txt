{
  "purpose": "The code appears to invoke a test helper to run tests or perform some form of automated check on the current file.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current file (__file__) as input data for the TestHelper.run method.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects, as the code only calls a testing function with the current filename.",
  "flows": "The source (__file__) is passed directly to TestHelper.run, which may process or inspect the file. No further data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code only performs a simple test run invocation; no suspicious or unusual code patterns are present. The use of inspectGlobals=False indicates an intention to limit scope, which is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a presumably third-party or internal 'python_helper' module and calls its 'TestHelper.run' method, passing the current filename (__file__). It does not include any suspicious or malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements. The code's purpose appears to be executing tests or analysis on itself, which is a typical pattern in test automation. There are no external network calls, data leaks, or malicious behaviors observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple test invocation using a helper library, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of a testing framework or development utility.",
