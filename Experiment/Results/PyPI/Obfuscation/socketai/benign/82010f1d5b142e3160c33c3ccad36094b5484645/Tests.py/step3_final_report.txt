  "purpose": "Invoke the TestHelper's run method on the current file with specific parameters for testing and logging.",
  "sources": "The import statement from python_helper and the __file__ variable used as input to TestHelper.run()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or network operations; the code only calls a method from an imported library",
  "flows": "The import source flows into the call to TestHelper.run(), which processes the current file (__file__)",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscated patterns or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code imports a helper library and executes a testing function on the current script. There are no signs of malicious activity, data leaks, or network operations. The external library's trustworthiness is a consideration, but the code itself is benign. The malware score is set to 0, reflecting no malicious intent. The security risk is minimal, primarily depending on the external package's integrity, so a score of 0.2 is appropriate. The code is simple, clear, and standard for testing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test invocation with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The external dependency poses a minimal trust risk, but the code itself is safe. The malware score remains 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk score 0.2 to reflect external dependency considerations.",
