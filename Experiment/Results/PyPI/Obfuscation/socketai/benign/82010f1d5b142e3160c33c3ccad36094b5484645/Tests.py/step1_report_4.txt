{
  "purpose": "To run a test helper utility from the 'python_helper' library, likely for testing or validation purposes.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'TestHelper' from 'python_helper' and then calls 'TestHelper.run' with the current file as an argument.",
  "sinks": "The 'TestHelper.run' function is called with parameters that may process the current file; potential data flows depend on implementation, but no external or untrusted data is explicitly handled.",
  "flows": "Input (current file) passed to 'TestHelper.run', which may process it internally; no other data flow evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious variable names, or unusual code structures. The code is straightforward, calling a testing utility.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a helper class and executes a method that appears to run tests or validations on the current file. There are no signs of data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious behavior. The code relies on an external library, which is not suspicious by itself. No suspicious or malicious activity is observable in this minimal snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple invocation of a testing utility to run tests or checks on itself. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks present in this snippet.",
