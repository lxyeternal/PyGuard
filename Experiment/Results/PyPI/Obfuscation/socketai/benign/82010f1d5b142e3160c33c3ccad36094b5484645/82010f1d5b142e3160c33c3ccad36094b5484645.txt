      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code contains significant errors due to undefined variables, which prevent proper execution. While obfuscation and incomplete URL construction are suspicious, there is no direct evidence of malicious activity. The primary concern is code correctness and potential misconfiguration, not malware. The overall security risk is low, but the code should be fixed and clarified."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard test invocation with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The external dependency poses a minimal trust risk, but the code itself is safe. The malware score remains 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk score 0.2 to reflect external dependency considerations."

Current scores are appropriate; no immediate threat is confirmed. Continued analysis of the full codebase is recommended to ensure no concealed malicious logic exists."

The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with a high obfuscation score justified by naming, and malware and risk scores correctly set to zero or near-zero."

The obfuscation alone does not justify higher risk scores. Overall, the code poses minimal security concern and can be considered safe."

      "conclusion": "The code is a high-risk utility characterized by obfuscation, dynamic module/resource management, and subprocess execution without input validation. While explicit malicious payloads are not evident, its architecture poses substantial security risks if inputs are manipulated. It warrants strict input validation, refactoring for clarity, and cautious deployment in security-sensitive contexts."
