  "purpose": "The code defines two classes with methods that generate formatted strings based on input arguments.",
  "sources": "Input arguments to the methods VfABMXofPxFAxIsUGaGUFUWzySmBfkha",
  "sinks": "Return statements producing formatted strings; no external data or untrusted sources used",
  "flows": "Input argument flows into return string, but no external data or side effects involved",
  "anomalies": "Class and method names appear obfuscated and nonsensical, but do not perform malicious operations; no hardcoded credentials, external network calls, or suspicious behaviors detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two classes with similarly named methods that return formatted strings containing the provided argument. There are no imports, network operations, file manipulations, or other suspicious behaviors. The obfuscated class and method names suggest an attempt to hide intent, but the code's functionality is benign. No malicious or malicious-like behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors is present. The code is minimal and appears to be placeholder or obfuscated but harmless.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and does not exhibit malicious behavior. The obfuscated naming may suggest an attempt to hide intent, but functionally, it only formats and returns strings. No security risks are identified based on this fragment.",
