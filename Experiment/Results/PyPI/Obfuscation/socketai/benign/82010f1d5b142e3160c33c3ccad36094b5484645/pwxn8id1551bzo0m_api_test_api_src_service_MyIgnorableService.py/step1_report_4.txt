{
  "purpose": "The code defines two classes with methods that return formatted strings including the provided argument. There is no indication of malicious intent or data manipulation.",
  "sources": "The methods receive 'argument' as input parameter.",
  "sinks": "The argument is incorporated into a formatted string and returned, with no further processing or external data transmission.",
  "flows": "Input argument -> method return value containing the argument.",
  "anomalies": "The class and method names appear obfuscated, but no malicious patterns such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code execution are evident. The functions are simple string formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two classes with similarly named methods that accept an argument and return a string embedding that argument. There are no external data sources, no network operations, file manipulations, or obfuscated code constructs. The naming could suggest obfuscation, but functionally, the code appears benign. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. The obfuscated-looking class and method names are not suspicious in this context, as the functions are simple string formatters.",

  "obfuscated": 0.8,
