  "purpose": "Define a class with a class variable and instantiate an object of that class.",
  "sources": "Class definition (no external data input), instantiation of the class.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output functions are present.",
  "flows": "No flow of data from sources to sinks; no operations on external or untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated or misleading class and variable names; no apparent functional purpose. No input/output, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with a non-descriptive name containing a single class attribute set to a string. Then it creates an instance of this class. There are no data inputs, outputs, or any code that could process untrusted data. No network activity, file operations, or sensitive data handling. The code appears to be benign and straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and benign, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It appears to be a minimal example or placeholder code with no suspicious elements.",
