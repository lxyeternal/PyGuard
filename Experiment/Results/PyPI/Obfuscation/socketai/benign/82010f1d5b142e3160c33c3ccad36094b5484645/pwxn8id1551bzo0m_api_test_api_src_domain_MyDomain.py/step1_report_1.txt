  "purpose": "Define a class with a class variable and instantiate an object of that class.",
  "sources": "Class definition and class variable assignment",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks present",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; code only sets a class variable and creates an instance",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears straightforward and benign",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with a single class attribute and then creates an instance of this class. There are no inputs, data processing, or external communications. The class variable contains a string value, but this alone does not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns are present. Overall, the code appears to serve as a simple class and object instantiation without malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It simply defines a class and instantiates it, with no malicious behaviors or data leaks observed.",
