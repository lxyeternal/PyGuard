  "purpose": "The code defines two classes, each with a method that formats and returns a string containing an input argument.",
  "sources": "Input arguments to the methods VfABMXofPxFAxIsUGaGUFUWzySmBfkha in both classes.",
  "sinks": "Return statements that output formatted strings containing the input argument.",
  "flows": "Input arguments flow directly into the return statement, producing a string that includes the argument.",
  "anomalies": "Method and class names are obfuscated, which is often suspicious. The methods simply format and return strings with the input; no apparent malicious behavior or external data access is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code contains two classes with obfuscated names, each with a method that takes an argument and returns a string embedding that argument. No external data access, network activity, or other suspicious operations are present. The methods are straightforward and do not perform any dangerous actions. The obfuscation might be intended to hide purpose, but without additional context, there is no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be benign, consisting of simple classes with methods that format and return strings. No malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activities are evident based on this snippet.",
