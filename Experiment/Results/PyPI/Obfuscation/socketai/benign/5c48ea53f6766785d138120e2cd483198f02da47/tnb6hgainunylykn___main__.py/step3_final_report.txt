  "purpose": "A CLI launcher script that imports an obfuscated component, modifies sys.argv[0], and executes the component.",
  "sources": "Imports from local module (.cli), reads sys.argv, and executes the imported function.",
  "sinks": "Modifies sys.argv[0], which can mask process identity; calls an external, obfuscated function.",
  "flows": "Reads sys.argv, modifies sys.argv[0], then calls the imported component, passing control to it.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated import name, overwriting sys.argv[0], minimal code with no comments or documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports an obfuscated component, modifies sys.argv[0], and executes it, then exits. No explicit malicious activity such as network communication or data exfiltration is evident. The obfuscated import name and environment masking are suspicious but not conclusive. The behavior suggests a launcher or wrapper, possibly to conceal the true purpose or origin. The suspicion is primarily due to obfuscation and process masking, which are common in malicious scripts but also in protected or obfuscated legitimate tools. The scores assigned in the reports reflect high obfuscation (around 0.7-0.8), low malware suspicion (around 0.1-0.2), and moderate risk (around 0.2-0.4). Given the evidence, the overall assessment is that the code is suspicious but not definitively malicious. Further analysis of the imported component is necessary to confirm its behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code acts as a minimal CLI wrapper with obfuscated components and environment masking, which are red flags but do not confirm malicious intent. The current suspicion levels are appropriate; however, increasing the malware suspicion score slightly to reflect moderate suspicion due to obfuscation is advisable. Further investigation into the imported component is recommended to determine its true behavior.",
