  "conclusion": "The code acts as a minimal CLI wrapper with obfuscated components and environment masking, which are red flags but do not confirm malicious intent. The current suspicion levels are appropriate; however, increasing the malware suspicion score slightly to reflect moderate suspicion due to obfuscation is advisable. Further investigation into the imported component is recommended to determine its true behavior."
