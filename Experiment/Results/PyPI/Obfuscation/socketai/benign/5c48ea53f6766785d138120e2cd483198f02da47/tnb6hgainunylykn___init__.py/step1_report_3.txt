{
  "purpose": "Import all functions or classes from the local module 'ipymagic' and set the package version to '2.2.2'.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .ipymagic, the assignment of version string to three variables.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no untrusted data processing, no network or file operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; only static assignments and import.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names 'VzoxcKfeVswXQETwdBkRJjoCXKAMhHld' and 'BsJiXewOKyUSWyQEhgWUscmBczzJvRjP' which are not used elsewhere; the assignment appears unnecessary or obfuscated.",
  "analysis": "The code imports everything from a local module 'ipymagic', which is typical in package modules. It then assigns a version string '2.2.2' to three different variables, two of which have obfuscated names. These variables are not used elsewhere in the snippet, suggesting possible obfuscation or placeholder code. There are no network calls, data leaks, or malicious functions present. The obfuscated variable names do not inherently indicate malicious intent but could be a sign of obfuscation or attempt to hide malicious code. Since only variable assignments and import are present, no suspicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily performs a straightforward import and version assignment, with obfuscated variable names that are unused. No malicious activity or security risks are apparent based on this snippet.",
