  "purpose": "Import all functions or classes from the local module '.ipymagic' and define the version string for the package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from '.ipymagic'; assignment of version string to multiple variables.",
  "sinks": "Assignment of version string to variables; no other data sinks or external data flows detected.",
  "flows": "None involving untrusted data; static assignment of version string does not create data flow paths.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names such as 'VzoxcKfeVswXQETwdBkRJjoCXKAMhHld' and 'BsJiXewOKyUSWyQEhgWUscmBczzJvRjP' suggest obfuscation or placeholder naming. No indication of malicious behavior or backdoors. The import statement appears standard, but the variable naming is suspiciously obfuscated.",
  "analysis": "The code imports all contents from a local module '.ipymagic', which is common in Python packages. It then assigns the string '2.2.2' to multiple variables with highly obfuscated names. This pattern could be benign versioning but also could serve as a distraction or concealment. No code injection, network activity, or malicious actions are present. The obfuscated variable names are unusual but do not inherently indicate malicious intent; they might be placeholder or auto-generated names. Overall, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, but the obfuscated naming warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily performs a standard import and version assignment with obfuscated variable names. There are no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The obfuscation is suspicious but not necessarily malicious. Overall, the code appears benign but warrants further review of the imported module for completeness.",
