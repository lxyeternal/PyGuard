  "purpose": "Import all contents from the local ipymagic module and set the version string to '2.2.2'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .ipymagic; assignment of version string to multiple variables.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data is used or transmitted.",
  "flows": "The imported module is loaded, and version information is assigned to multiple variables.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names such as VzoxcKfeVswXQETwdBkRJjoCXKAMhHld and BsJiXewOKyUSWyQEhgWUscmBczzJvRjP, which appear obfuscated or autogenerated, with no clear purpose. No clear malicious activity or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports everything from a local module named ipymagic, which is standard and not inherently malicious. The subsequent assignment of the version string '2.2.2' to multiple variables with obscure names is unusual but does not necessarily indicate malicious intent; it could be obfuscation or simply redundant variable assignments. There are no suspicious functions, data flows, or network activity. No sensitive data or external inputs are read or written. The code does not perform any operations that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign, performing standard import and version assignment tasks. The unusual variable names are suspicious but do not constitute malicious behavior based on this snippet alone. No evidence of malware or security risks is present.",
