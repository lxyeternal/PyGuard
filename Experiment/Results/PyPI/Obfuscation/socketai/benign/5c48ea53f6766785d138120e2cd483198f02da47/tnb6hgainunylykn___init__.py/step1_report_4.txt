  "purpose": "Import all contents from the ipymagic module and define the version string for this package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .ipymagic",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external data transmission observed",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "The variable assignment line includes obfuscated or intentionally complex variable names with no apparent functional purpose, which can be suspicious. The code assigns the version string to multiple variables, possibly to hide or obscure its presence.",
  "analysis": "The code imports all symbols from a local module 'ipymagic', which is common in Python packages. The subsequent line assigns the string '2.2.2' to three different variables with non-descriptive, obfuscated names. The variable names do not serve any obvious functional purpose and could be an attempt to hide version information or complicate code analysis. There are no evident malicious actions such as data exfiltration, network activity, or code injection. The obfuscation of variable names, while suspicious, does not necessarily indicate malicious intent but warrants caution. Overall, the code appears to be standard package setup with some obfuscated variable naming that may be intended for concealment or could be a code style choice.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard import from a local module and sets version variables with obfuscated names. There is no clear malicious behavior detected; however, the obfuscated variable names raise slight suspicion about hiding intent. No evidence of malware or security risks is present.",
