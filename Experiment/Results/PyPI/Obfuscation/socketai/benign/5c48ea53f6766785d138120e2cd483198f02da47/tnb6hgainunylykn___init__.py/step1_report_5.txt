  "purpose": "Import all contents from the local ipymagic module and set version variables.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .ipymagic",
  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "None, as there are no data flows or external data handling",
  "anomalies": "Multiple variables assigned the same string version, using obscure variable names, but no malicious activity observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports everything from a relative module named ipymagic, which is common in modular Python projects. It then assigns the string '2.2.2' to three variables with obfuscated names. These assignments do not execute any untrusted input or external data. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code activities. The code is minimal and appears to be for versioning or metadata purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, importing a module and setting version information with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It appears safe.",
