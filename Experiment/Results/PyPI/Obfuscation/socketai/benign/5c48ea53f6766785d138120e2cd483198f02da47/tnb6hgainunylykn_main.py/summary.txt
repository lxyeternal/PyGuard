  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate profiling visualization server with superficial obfuscation. No evidence of malware or malicious activity is detected. The main security issue is unvalidated 'profile_name' input, which could be exploited for directory traversal. The current malware score is 0, obfuscation score is moderate (~0.7), and security risk score should be increased slightly (~0.6) to reflect the input validation concern. Implementing input sanitization would mitigate this risk."
