  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated testing suite with a suspicious import statement, which could indicate malicious intent or obfuscation to hide malicious payloads. While no active malicious activity is directly observed, the suspicious import and obfuscation justify a malware score of approximately 0.6 and a security risk score of about 0.5. The obfuscation score remains high (~0.8). It is recommended to verify the origin of the 'snakeviz' package and ensure the import is legitimate before execution."
