  "purpose": "Module initialization with import statements and symbol exports.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.version and .tempenv).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "Import symbols are assigned to module namespace; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated import identifiers; no dynamic code execution or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines __all__ and imports symbols with nonsensical names, which is suspicious but not malicious. No data flows, network calls, or code execution are evident. The obfuscated identifiers suggest possible concealment but could also be internal naming conventions. The referenced modules are not provided, so their content cannot be assessed. The overall structure is minimal and benign in isolation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign module initializer with obfuscated symbol names. No evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities is present in this fragment. The obfuscation warrants further review of the imported modules, but based solely on this snippet, the supply chain risk is low.",
