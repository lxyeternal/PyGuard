  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .version and .tempenv.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or potential data leaks.",
  "flows": "Imports from internal modules do not create source-to-sink data flows with untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual import names: jMGAXOFsMTXfHyWYmPjDFIGeecOjQtBc, GCPwuVfjQlSZJTdOOJmkShPXxBXbWHrg, HydxEVkcYlvayxUdowQjtMDHoMzRjpVF, which appear as random or obfuscated identifiers. No actual code execution or dynamic behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of a module declaration with __all__ and three import statements from sibling modules. The imported identifiers are obfuscated or randomly named, which could suggest an attempt to hide their purpose, but this alone does not indicate malicious intent. There are no data flows, no input sources, and no suspicious operations such as network connections, data exfiltration, or code execution. The structure appears to be a standard Python module with unusual naming conventions but no active malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module setup with obfuscated import identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks based on this snippet. The obfuscated naming could be for internal concealment but does not inherently suggest malicious intent.",
