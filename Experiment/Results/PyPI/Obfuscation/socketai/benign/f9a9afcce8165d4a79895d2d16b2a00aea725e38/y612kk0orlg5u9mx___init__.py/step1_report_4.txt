  "purpose": "Define module exports and import specific components from relative modules.",
  "sources": "Import statements from .version and .tempenv modules.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that handle untrusted data or external effects.",
  "flows": "Imported symbols are assigned to __all__, indicating intended public API; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Imported identifiers appear as random strings, which could suggest obfuscation or generated code; no other suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code only declares an __all__ list and imports three components from local modules, using seemingly random, non-descriptive identifiers. There are no functions, no network calls, no data handling, and no hardcoded credentials. The use of random-looking identifiers might suggest obfuscation, but given the limited scope, it could also be a non-malicious pattern. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment appears to be a simple module export declaration with obfuscated import names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks based on this snippet alone.",
