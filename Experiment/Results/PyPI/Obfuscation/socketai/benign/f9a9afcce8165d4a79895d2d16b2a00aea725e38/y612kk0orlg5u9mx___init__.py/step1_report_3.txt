  "purpose": "Export certain attributes and classes for a package, likely related to environment variables and versioning.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing specific objects from local modules '.version' and '.tempenv'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no use of untrusted input or data manipulation observed.",
  "flows": "Imported objects are available for use elsewhere; no data flow from external sources is visible.",
  "anomalies": "Imported identifiers appear to be randomly generated strings, which is unusual and suspicious; no actual malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines __all__ for module exports, which is standard. It imports objects from local modules with obfuscated names that seem to be randomly generated strings, potentially indicating obfuscation or malicious intent. However, the imported modules are not shown, so their contents cannot be assessed. There are no apparent malicious actions, network activity, or sensitive data handling in this fragment. The unusual naming is suspicious but not conclusive of malicious behavior on its own.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module setup with obfuscated import identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain attack within this snippet. The unusual naming warrants further review of the imported modules, but based solely on this code, the risk is low.",
