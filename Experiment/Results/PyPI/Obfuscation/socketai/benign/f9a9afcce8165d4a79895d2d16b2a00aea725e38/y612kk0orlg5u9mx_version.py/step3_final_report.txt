  "purpose": "Metadata variables containing author, copyright, license, and version information.",
  "sources": "Variable assignments reading static string literals.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks or external interactions.",
  "flows": "Static assignments with no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, but no malicious or suspicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code solely assigns static strings to variables with obfuscated names, serving as metadata. No input, output, dynamic code execution, or network activity is present. The obfuscation of variable names is noted but not indicative of malicious intent in this context. The code's benign nature is confirmed by the absence of malicious patterns, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely metadata with obfuscated variable names, posing no security threat or malicious intent. The current malware score of 0 and low security risk are appropriate. Obfuscation is noted but not malicious; scores reflect the benign nature of the code.",
