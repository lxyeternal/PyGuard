{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define metadata information such as author, copyright, license, and version for a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded string literals assigned to variables for metadata information.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input sources or data output sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The variables are assigned static string values; no flow of untrusted data occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only metadata assignments with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of hardcoded metadata variables including author name, copyright, license, and version. No input handling, network activity, or executable logic is present. The variables are simply string literals assigned to variables with obfuscated-like variable names but without malicious intent. There are no signs of malware, malicious code, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign metadata information with no evidence of malicious behavior or security concerns.",
