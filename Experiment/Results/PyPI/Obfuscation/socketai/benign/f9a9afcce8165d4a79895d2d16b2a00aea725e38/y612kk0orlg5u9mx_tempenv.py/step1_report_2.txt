  "purpose": "Manage environment variables contextually, allowing temporary modifications and restoring them after use.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables with os.environ.get()",
  "sinks": "Modifying os.environ with new values or deleting keys",
  "flows": "Reading environment variables in __enter__, modifying or deleting them, and restoring original values in __exit__",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names; no explicit hardcoded secrets or malicious code detected; standard environment variable management",
  "analysis": "The code defines a context manager for temporarily setting environment variables based on a provided directives dictionary. It stores original environment states, applies new values if provided, and restores or deletes them upon exit. There is no indication of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful operations. The obfuscated variable names could hinder readability but are not inherently malicious. The logic is consistent with safe environment management. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code manages environment variables safely within a context, restoring previous states after execution. It does not contain malicious code or behavior, merely performing controlled environment modifications.",
