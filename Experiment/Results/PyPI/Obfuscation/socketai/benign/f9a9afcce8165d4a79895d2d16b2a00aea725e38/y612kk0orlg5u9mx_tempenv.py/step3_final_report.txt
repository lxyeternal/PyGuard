  "purpose": "Manage environment variables temporarily within a context, restoring original values afterward.",
  "sources": "Environment variables accessed via os.environ.get during __enter__ and __exit__.",
  "sinks": "Modification and deletion of environment variables in os.environ.",
  "flows": "Read environment variables during __enter__, modify or delete them, then restore or delete during __exit__.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names, which hinder readability but do not indicate malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a context manager that saves original environment variable values, applies new directives, and restores/deletes them upon exit. No network, file, or system calls suggest malicious activity. Obfuscation reduces clarity but is not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are present. Warnings are issued if environment variables change unexpectedly, which is a cautious practice. The malware score is appropriately set to 0, as no malicious behavior is evident. Obfuscation scores are high (~0.75), reflecting the obfuscated identifiers, and security risk scores are low (~0.2), consistent with benign environment management. Overall, the code appears benign, with obfuscation being the main concern but not indicative of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign environment variable context manager with obfuscated identifiers. No signs of malware or malicious activity are present. The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not alone suggest malicious intent. Scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
