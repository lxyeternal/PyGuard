  "purpose": "This code manages environment variables using context management to temporarily set or restore them.",
  "sources": "Environment variables accessed via os.environ.get() for reading current state and setting new values.",
  "sinks": "Modifies environment variables; potential for influencing system behavior or leaking environment data if misused.",
  "flows": "Reads environment variables -> modifies environment variables during __enter__ -> restores environment variables during __exit__.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class names and variable names; no hardcoded secrets or credentials; no suspicious network activity; no code injection or malicious system commands.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a context manager to temporarily modify environment variables based on a provided directives dictionary. It saves original environment states, applies updates, and restores or removes them upon exit. The class names and variable naming are intentionally obfuscated but do not indicate malicious intent. The code operates solely within the environment management domain, without network activity, file manipulation, or data exfiltration. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs environment variable management without any malicious behavior. Its obfuscated naming appears to serve code concealment rather than malicious purpose. No security risks or malware are identified based on the provided code.",
