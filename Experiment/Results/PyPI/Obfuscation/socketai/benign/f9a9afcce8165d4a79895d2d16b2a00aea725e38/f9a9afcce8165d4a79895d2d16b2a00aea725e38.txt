      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The primary security concern is the use of exec() to execute external code, which could lead to arbitrary code execution if the version file is compromised. Obfuscated variables and embedded secrets heighten suspicion. The code should be reviewed thoroughly, and exec() should be replaced with safer alternatives. The embedded secret and external URL further suggest malicious intent or sabotage. Overall, the code poses a high security risk and could be malicious."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign module initializer with obfuscated symbol names. No evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities is present in this fragment. The obfuscation warrants further review of the imported modules, but based solely on this snippet, the supply chain risk is low."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign environment variable context manager with obfuscated identifiers. No signs of malware or malicious activity are present. The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not alone suggest malicious intent. Scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
