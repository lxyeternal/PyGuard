  "purpose": "The code appears to perform some form of data processing or computation, but without specific comments or documentation, the exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Potential sources include reading input from environment variables, files, or user input; however, the provided code does not explicitly show data reading points.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could be network communication, file writing, or execution of system commands, but there are no obvious indications of such actions in the code provided.",
  "flows": "No explicit source-to-sink data flow is observable; the code mainly performs calculations or variable assignments without external data interaction.",
  "anomalies": "There are no obvious signs of hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs. The code appears straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code does not contain any input validation, insecure data handling, or suspicious function calls. It uses standard Python syntax and library functions without anomalies. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. The absence of external network calls or system modifications further supports this.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the detailed review, the code shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be benign, with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
