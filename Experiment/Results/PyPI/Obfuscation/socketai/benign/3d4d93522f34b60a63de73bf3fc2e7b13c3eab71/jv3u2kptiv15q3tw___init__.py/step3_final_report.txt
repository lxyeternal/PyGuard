  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Obfuscated code segments, dynamic execution functions (eval/exec), hardcoded URLs/credentials, environment variables, network operations.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file system, environment variables, dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as obfuscated strings and environment variables flow into eval/exec or network functions, potentially leading to data exfiltration or malicious payload execution.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation, use of eval/exec, suspicious string manipulations, hardcoded URLs/credentials, signs of data exfiltration, dynamic code execution without clear purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are common in malicious scripts. Hardcoded credentials and URLs suggest potential data exfiltration or command-and-control communication. The presence of eval/exec without safeguards increases risk. Benign code lacks these indicators. The suspicion level is high where obfuscation and suspicious patterns are present, leading to elevated malware and security risk scores. Benign code shows straightforward structure with no suspicious activity. Adjustments are made to malware scores to better reflect the observed signs.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency contains heavily obfuscated code with signs of malicious intent, especially in reports indicating dynamic execution and data exfiltration patterns. Scores are adjusted to reflect the severity, with the highest concern in report 3. Benign code is correctly scored as low risk. Overall, the assessment aligns with the observed indicators, emphasizing caution with obfuscated and dynamic code segments.",
