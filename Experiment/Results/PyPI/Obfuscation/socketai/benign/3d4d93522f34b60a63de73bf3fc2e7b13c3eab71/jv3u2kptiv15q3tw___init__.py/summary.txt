  "conclusion": "The dependency contains heavily obfuscated code with signs of malicious intent, especially in reports indicating dynamic execution and data exfiltration patterns. Scores are adjusted to reflect the severity, with the highest concern in report 3. Benign code is correctly scored as low risk. Overall, the assessment aligns with the observed indicators, emphasizing caution with obfuscated and dynamic code segments."
