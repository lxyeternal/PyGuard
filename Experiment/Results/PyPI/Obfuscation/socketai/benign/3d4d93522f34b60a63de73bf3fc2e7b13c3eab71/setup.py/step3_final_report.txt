{
  "purpose": "Configure a Python package with obfuscated parameter names and external dependency links, likely to hide malicious intent or mislead analysis.",
  "sources": "Obfuscated setup() parameters, dependency_links pointing to a GitHub repository",
  "sinks": "Potential for external code execution during package installation, data exfiltration via hidden code",
  "flows": "External dependency fetched during install, obfuscated parameters potentially used to hide malicious code",
  "anomalies": "Non-standard, random parameter names; use of deprecated dependency_links; obfuscated strings",
  "analysis": "The code uses heavily obfuscated parameter names in setup(), which are not standard setuptools arguments, indicating intentional obfuscation. The dependency_links points to a GitHub URL, which is deprecated and can be exploited to inject malicious code. No active malicious code or data flow is visible in this static snippet, but the obfuscation and external dependency are red flags. The high obfuscation score (around 0.9) is justified, and the potential for malicious payloads during installation warrants a malware score of approximately 0.7. The security risk score is also high (~0.8) due to the combination of obfuscation and external dependency, which could host malicious code. Overall, the code is suspicious, heavily obfuscated, and relies on external sources that could be malicious, requiring further verification before use.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and reliance on external dependencies that could host malicious code, posing a significant supply chain security risk. While no direct malicious activity is evident in this static snippet, the combination of factors warrants a high suspicion level and cautious handling.",
