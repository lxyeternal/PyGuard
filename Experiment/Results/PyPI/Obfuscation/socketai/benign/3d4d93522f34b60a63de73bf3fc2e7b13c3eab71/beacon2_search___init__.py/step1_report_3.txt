  "sources": "Input sources could include environment variables, user input functions, or data from external files or network connections; however, specific sources cannot be identified without the code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communication functions, file write operations, or subprocess executions, but specifics cannot be identified without the code.",
  "flows": "Data flow from sources to sinks cannot be mapped without the code, but typical flows might involve user input or environment variables being used in network or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies can be identified without viewing the actual code. Common anomalies to watch for include hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "Insufficient code details provided for detailed analysis. Cannot identify specific sources, sinks, or malicious patterns. The review requires the actual code content to assess security risks and potential malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "Unable to determine the purpose, data flow, or security concerns without the actual code. No suspicious or malicious behavior can be confirmed at this time.",
