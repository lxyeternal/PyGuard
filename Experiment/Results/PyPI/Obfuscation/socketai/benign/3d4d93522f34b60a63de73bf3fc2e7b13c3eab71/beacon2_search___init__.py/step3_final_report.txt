  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code structure, suspicious patterns, obfuscation, and potential malicious activities.",
  "sources": "Input reading functions, environment variable access, network connections, dynamic evaluation points, hardcoded secrets, and data sinks such as file writes or network transmissions.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, file system, environment variables, system commands, or data exfiltration points where untrusted data could lead to leaks or system compromise.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources like input or environment variables through processing functions to sinks such as network or file operations, potentially involving obfuscation or dynamic code execution to hide malicious intent.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscation, complex control flow, dynamic evaluation (eval/exec), hardcoded secrets, missing or empty code sections, or inconsistent patterns that deviate from typical benign code.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits high obfuscation levels in some reports, with dynamic evaluation and complex control flow, raising suspicion but lacking concrete evidence of malicious payloads. Several reports correctly identify the absence of code or benign patterns, assigning low malware scores (0 to 0.3). The high obfuscation scores (up to 0.8) reflect the suspicion, while security risks are moderate (around 0.3 to 0.5), consistent with potential concealment but no confirmed malicious activity. The confidence levels vary, with high confidence in benign assessments and moderate confidence where obfuscation or ambiguity exists. Overall, the code appears suspicious mainly due to obfuscation, but no definitive malicious actions are confirmed. The scores are consistent with the reasoning, and further dynamic analysis is recommended for obfuscated segments to conclusively rule out malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency shows signs of obfuscation and complex control flow, which warrant caution. However, no explicit malicious activity is confirmed based on the available information. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. Continued monitoring and dynamic testing are advised to ensure supply chain integrity.",
