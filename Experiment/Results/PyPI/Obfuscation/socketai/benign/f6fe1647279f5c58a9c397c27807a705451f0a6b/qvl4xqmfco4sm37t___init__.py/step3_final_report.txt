{
  "purpose": "The code imports classes and functions from the 'nillion_python_helpers' package, with obfuscated identifiers, likely to conceal functionality.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'nillion_python_helpers' package, reading module-level identifiers.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed; only import statements present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution beyond imports; no source-to-sink paths demonstrated.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated or nonsensical identifiers used for imported classes/functions, indicating potential concealment or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with obfuscated names, which raises suspicion but does not demonstrate malicious activity. The high obfuscation scores reflect concern over concealment, but the lack of logic, data flow, or network activity suggests no active threat. Malware scores are low, consistent with the absence of evidence. The overall security risk remains low, but the obfuscation warrants further review of the package to ensure legitimacy.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet shows only obfuscated import statements without evidence of malicious behavior. While obfuscation is suspicious, it does not confirm malicious intent. Scores are appropriately conservative, emphasizing the need for further investigation into the package's content rather than immediate concern based solely on these imports.",
