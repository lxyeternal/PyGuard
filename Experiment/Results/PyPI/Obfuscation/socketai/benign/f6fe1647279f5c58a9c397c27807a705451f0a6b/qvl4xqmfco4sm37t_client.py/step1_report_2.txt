  "purpose": "Initialize and return a NillionClient object with specified parameters, possibly using environment variables for configuration.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'NILLION_BOOTNODE_MULTIADDRESS' via os.getenv.",
  "sinks": "The returned nillion.NillionClient may send or receive data over network connections; environment variable is used for configuration, but no direct sink of untrusted input detected.",
  "flows": "os.getenv input flows into the list used as a parameter in NillionClient; no other data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variable for configuration is standard; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code detected. Function and variable names appear obfuscated but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that initializes a client object with parameters, including an optional environment variable default. It uses the os module to retrieve an environment variable and passes it into the client constructor. No suspicious data handling, no network calls other than what the client might perform internally, which is standard. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate client initialization routine with no evident malicious intent. It uses environment variables for configuration, which is common practice. No signs of malware or security risks are detected.",
