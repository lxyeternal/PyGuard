  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a client setup routine with some obfuscation and external configuration. No evidence of malicious activity or supply chain compromise is detected. The risk and malware scores should remain low, with a moderate obfuscation score justified by the naming. Overall, the code is low risk but warrants standard security practices for environment variable management."
