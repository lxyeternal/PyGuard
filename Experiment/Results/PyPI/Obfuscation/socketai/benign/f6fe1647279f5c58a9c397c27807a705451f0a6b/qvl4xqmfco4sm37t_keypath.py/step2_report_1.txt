  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the original code and considering the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is minimal, primarily loading cryptographic keys from files using the 'py_nillion_client' library.\n- No hardcoded secrets, no network activity, no obfuscation within the code itself—only obfuscated function names.\n- The functions serve as utilities for key management, with no evident malicious behavior.\n- The obfuscated function names could be a concern, but they do not directly imply malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** Accurate; the code loads keys from files, no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0.1, Obfuscated=0, Confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** The low risk and malware scores are appropriate. The high confidence aligns with the straightforward analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Also accurate; mentions obfuscated names and benign behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0.2, Obfuscated=0.4, Confidence=0.8\n- **Assessment:** The obfuscation score is moderate; reasonable given the function names. No malware, and the overall benign interpretation holds.\n\n**Verdict:** No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, emphasizes no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0.2, Obfuscated=0, Confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** Slightly lower obfuscation score; consistent with the code. The risk score is appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights obfuscated function names and potential suspicion.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0.2, Obfuscated=0.8, Confidence=0.4\n- **Assessment:** The high obfuscation score is justified, but the malware score remains zero, which is appropriate. The confidence is lower, reflecting uncertainty.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are reasonable; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others; notes obfuscation but benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0.2, Obfuscated=0.7, Confidence=0.8\n- **Assessment:** The obfuscation score is high, which is justified. Malware remains zero.\n\n**Verdict:** No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, consistent with the analysis—no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** Slight variation, but generally justified given the non-descriptive function names.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low, reflecting minimal security concern based solely on this code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### **My own assessment:**\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — The code is benign, merely loading keys from files.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** 0.6 — The function names are non-descriptive, which could be an attempt to conceal purpose, warranting a moderate obfuscation score.\n\n**Risk score:** 0.2 — Slightly elevated due to obfuscation, but no active security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### **Final notes:**\n\n- The code itself appears safe; the main concern is the obfuscation, which could be a red flag if part of a larger malicious pattern.\n- The scores across reports are generally reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Summary:** I agree with the assigned scores, with minor adjustments to obfuscation scores where appropriate. The overall risk remains low, with no malware detected.",
