{
  "purpose": "Load user and node keys from specified file paths using the py_nillion_client library.",
  "sources": "File paths provided as arguments to the functions (userkey_filepath, nodekey_filepath).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or external communication are present; functions only read from files.",
  "flows": "Input file paths → loading functions (from_file) → returned key objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures. The code appears to perform straightforward key loading.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific client library and defines two functions that load user and node keys from files using the library's 'from_file' method. There is no indication of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or execution of arbitrary code. The functions rely on external files, which could be malicious if the files themselves are compromised, but the code itself does not exhibit suspicious activity. Overall, the code is minimal and standard for key loading with no signs of obfuscation or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and appears legitimate, serving the purpose of loading cryptographic keys from files. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks within this fragment.",
