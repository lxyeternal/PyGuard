  "purpose": "The code provides functions to load user and node keys from files using the py_nillion_client library.",
  "sources": "File paths provided as function arguments (userkey_filepath, nodekey_filepath).",
  "sinks": "Calls to nillion.UserKey.from_file() and nillion.NodeKey.from_file(), which read data from files.",
  "flows": "File path inputs -> key-loading functions -> return key objects.",
  "anomalies": "Function names are non-descriptive and obfuscated-looking; no validation or sanitization of file paths; no indication of encryption or secret handling beyond file loading.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific client library and defines two functions to load user and node keys from files, using presumably standard library methods. The function names appear intentionally obfuscated, which can sometimes indicate an attempt to hide intent, but they are only loading key data from files without any additional processing. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code execution. The functions rely on external library methods whose behavior is assumed to be standard. There is no evidence of hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or other malicious activity within this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply loads cryptographic keys from files and returns them. There are no clear indications of malicious intent, suspicious activity, or security risks within this snippet. The obfuscated function names alone do not suggest malicious behavior but could indicate an attempt to conceal purpose. Overall, the code appears benign.",
