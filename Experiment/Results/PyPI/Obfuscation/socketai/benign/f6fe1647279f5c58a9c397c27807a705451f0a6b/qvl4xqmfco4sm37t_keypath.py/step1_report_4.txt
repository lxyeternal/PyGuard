  "purpose": "Load user and node keys from specified file paths using the nillion client library.",
  "sources": "File paths provided as arguments to the functions, which are used to load keys from files.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive key data loaded from files, but no data is transmitted or stored externally within this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Input file paths -> nillion.UserKey.from_file / nillion.NodeKey.from_file -> key objects",
  "anomalies": "Functions have obfuscated and non-descriptive names, which could be an attempt to hide their purpose. No validation or sanitization of file paths shown. No explicit malicious behavior, but the naming and lack of context raise suspicion.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a third-party library 'py_nillion_client' and defines two functions that load user and node keys from specified file paths. The functions are named with non-meaningful, obfuscated identifiers, which could be a tactic to conceal their purpose. There is no evidence of malicious actions such as data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoors within this snippet. However, the obfuscated naming and lack of comments or validation suggest an attempt to obscure intent. The code appears to simply load keys from files, which on its own is benign, but the context of usage could reveal malicious intent if integrated improperly.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs straightforward key loading operations with obfuscated function names, raising suspicion about possible intent to conceal purpose. No direct malicious activity detected in this snippet, but the obfuscation warrants caution. Overall, low confidence in malicious behavior based solely on this fragment, but the suspicious naming could be part of a broader malicious pattern.",
