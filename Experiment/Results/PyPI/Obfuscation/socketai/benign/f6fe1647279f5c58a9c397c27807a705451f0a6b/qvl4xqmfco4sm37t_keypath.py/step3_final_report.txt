  "purpose": "Utility functions for loading cryptographic keys from files using the 'py_nillion_client' library.",
  "sources": "File paths provided as arguments to the functions, which are read by 'from_file' methods.",
  "sinks": "Memory where the loaded key objects are stored; no external sinks or data leaks evident.",
  "flows": "Input file paths -> 'from_file' methods -> key objects in memory.",
  "anomalies": "Function names are obfuscated and non-descriptive; no validation or error handling present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two minimal functions that load cryptographic keys from specified files. The function names are obfuscated, which could be an attempt to conceal purpose but do not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or malicious code is present. The malware score is appropriately zero, indicating no malicious behavior. The obfuscation score is moderate to high, justified by the non-descriptive function names. The security risk score is low, reflecting the benign nature of the key-loading operations. Confidence in this assessment is high due to the straightforwardness of the code and lack of suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as utility functions for key management. The main concern is the obfuscated function names, which could be used to conceal malicious intent in a broader context, but based solely on this snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior. The scores are consistent with the analysis, with malware score at 0, obfuscation around 0.6, and low security risk.",
