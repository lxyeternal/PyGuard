  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as utility functions for key management. The main concern is the obfuscated function names, which could be used to conceal malicious intent in a broader context, but based solely on this snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior. The scores are consistent with the analysis, with malware score at 0, obfuscation around 0.6, and low security risk."
