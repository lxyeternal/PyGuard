{
  "purpose": "The code appears to load user and node keys from specified file paths, likely for authentication or initialization purposes within a larger application involving the 'py_nillion_client' library.",
  "sources": "File paths provided as arguments to the functions 'userkey_filepath' and 'nodekey_filepath' which are used to load key data from files.",
  "sinks": "The functions 'nillion.UserKey.from_file' and 'nillion.NodeKey.from_file' could potentially load sensitive key data into memory; these functions are the points where untrusted input (file paths) could influence behavior, but the content loaded is presumably cryptographic keys.",
  "flows": "Input file paths → function calls → loading key data into memory.",
  "anomalies": "Code is minimal and straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials or secrets. No obfuscated code, no network activity, and no suspicious behavior or side effects observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions that load cryptographic keys from files using methods from the 'py_nillion_client' library. There are no hardcoded secrets, no data leaks, and no external network interactions. The functions appear to be utility functions for key management, with standard usage patterns. The code does not perform any malicious operations, nor does it contain obfuscation or suspicious constructs. The minimal design reduces suspicion, and no anomalies are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and functional, designed for loading keys from files. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet. The functions serve as utilities for key management without any signs of malicious intent or security concerns.",
