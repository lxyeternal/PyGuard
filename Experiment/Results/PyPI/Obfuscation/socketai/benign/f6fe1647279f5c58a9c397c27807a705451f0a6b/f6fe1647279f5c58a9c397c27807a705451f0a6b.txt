Scores are appropriately conservative, emphasizing the need for further investigation into the package's content rather than immediate concern based solely on these imports."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as utility functions for key management. The main concern is the obfuscated function names, which could be used to conceal malicious intent in a broader context, but based solely on this snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior. The scores are consistent with the analysis, with malware score at 0, obfuscation around 0.6, and low security risk."

      "confidence": 0.85,
      "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a client setup routine with some obfuscation and external configuration. No evidence of malicious activity or supply chain compromise is detected. The risk and malware scores should remain low, with a moderate obfuscation score justified by the naming. Overall, the code is low risk but warrants standard security practices for environment variable management."
