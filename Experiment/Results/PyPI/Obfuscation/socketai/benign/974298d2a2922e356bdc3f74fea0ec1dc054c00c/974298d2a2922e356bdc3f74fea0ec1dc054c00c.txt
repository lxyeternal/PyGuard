      "conclusion": "The code is primarily a complex, reflection-heavy utility for code analysis and documentation generation. It does not contain explicit malicious payloads but has significant potential for misuse if untrusted inputs or modules are used. Its high obfuscation and dynamic features warrant caution, but no active malicious behavior is evident."

      "conclusion": "The snippet is a benign import statement with obfuscated function names, which could be an attempt to conceal malicious code. No malicious activity is evident at this level, but the obfuscation justifies further review of the 'functions' module. The scores are appropriate; malware score remains low, obfuscated score high, and overall risk low but cautious."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily obfuscated or placeholder, with no evidence of malicious activity. The suspicious import line is unusual but not inherently malicious. The overall security risk remains low, though obfuscation and import anomalies should be monitored in supply chain contexts."

      "obfuscated": 0.8,

      "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated test suite with no explicit malicious actions. Obfuscation warrants caution but does not currently indicate malware. The overall security risk is low, with a slight suspicion due to obfuscation. Further review of the actual module implementation is recommended to rule out hidden malicious code."
