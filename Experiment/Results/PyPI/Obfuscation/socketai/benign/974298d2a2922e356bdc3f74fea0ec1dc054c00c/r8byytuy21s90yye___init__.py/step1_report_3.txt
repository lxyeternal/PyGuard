  "purpose": "Import multiple functions from a local module named 'functions'.",
  "sources": "Import statement reading from a relative module 'functions'.",
  "targets": "Imported functions are assigned to local variables, but no data is processed or executed.",
  "flows": "No data flows or execution paths are evident beyond the import statement; no untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "anomalies": "Function names appear to be random strings, which may suggest obfuscation or code hiding, but no actual malicious behavior is detectable from import statements alone. No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious logic, and no external network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement bringing in multiple functions from a local module. The function names are nonsensical and look obfuscated, which could indicate an attempt to hide purpose. However, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code execution. Without additional context or code execution, this snippet alone does not pose any security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign import statement with obfuscated function names. No malicious activity or security risks are evident from this code fragment alone.",
