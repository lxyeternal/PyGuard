  "conclusion": "The code is primarily a complex, reflection-heavy utility for code analysis and documentation generation. It does not contain explicit malicious payloads but has significant potential for misuse if untrusted inputs or modules are used. Its high obfuscation and dynamic features warrant caution, but no active malicious behavior is evident."
