  "purpose": "Import obfuscated attributes from a local module and delete the module reference immediately afterward.",
  "sources": "Imports from .contour_compute module",
  "sinks": "None directly; no data flow or output operations",
  "flows": "Import statements followed by deletion of the module reference",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated attribute names, immediate deletion of the module reference after import",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward imports of three attributes with obfuscated names from a local module 'contour_compute'. The module is then deleted immediately, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. The attribute names are non-descriptive, suggesting obfuscation or autogenerated code. No data flow, network activity, or explicit malicious actions are visible. The import and deletion pattern could be used to conceal intent, but on its own, it does not demonstrate malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal, employing obfuscation tactics such as non-descriptive attribute names and immediate module deletion. There is no evidence of malicious activity, data exfiltration, or security vulnerabilities based solely on this snippet. The obfuscation raises suspicion but is not conclusive of malicious intent. The overall security risk is low, and the malware likelihood is minimal.",
