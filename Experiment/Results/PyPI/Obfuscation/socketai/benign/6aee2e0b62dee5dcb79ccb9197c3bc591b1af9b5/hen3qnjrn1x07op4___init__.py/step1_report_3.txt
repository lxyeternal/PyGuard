  "purpose": "Import specific obfuscated symbols from a local module and then delete the module reference.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing obfuscated symbols from .contour_compute module.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or data leaks; no external data handling or untrusted input sources.",
  "flows": "Imports the obfuscated symbols into the namespace, then deletes the module reference.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated, non-descriptive symbol names, and immediate deletion of the module after import, which is unusual.",
  "analysis": "The code imports three symbols with non-descriptive, obfuscated names from a local module 'contour_compute' and then deletes the module reference. The obfuscation suggests an attempt to hide intent or functionality. The immediate deletion of the module reference after import is atypical unless used to prevent further access or minimize memory footprint, which could be suspicious if part of obfuscation tactics. No malicious network activity, credential handling, or suspicious behavior is evident. However, the obfuscation and minimal code could be used to hide malicious payloads or functionality. Given only these few lines, the code shows signs of obfuscation but no explicit malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code employs obfuscation tactics by importing symbolically named entities and deleting the module reference immediately, which could be used to hide malicious intent or obscure functionality. There is no direct evidence of malicious behavior in this snippet, but the obfuscation warrants caution.",
