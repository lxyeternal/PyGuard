  "purpose": "Import specific functions or variables from the 'contour_compute' module, then delete the module reference.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'contour_compute' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks of untrusted data or potential security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "flows": "Imported functions/variables are not used within this snippet; deletion of the module reference occurs afterward.",
  "anomalies": "Imported identifiers are obfuscated or nonsensical names, suggesting possible obfuscation or autogenerated code. No actual usage of imported entities is shown, which is unusual but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports three items with seemingly random or obfuscated names from a local module, then deletes the module reference. The import names do not reveal any meaningful functionality. There are no signs of data flow, untrusted input handling, or malicious operations. The obfuscated names could suggest an attempt to hide code intent or could be autogenerated. However, the code itself does not perform any malicious actions or data leaks. The deletion of the module reference is benign and often used for cleanup.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple import and cleanup with obfuscated identifiers, which does not indicate malicious behavior or security risks. No suspicious activity is present.",
