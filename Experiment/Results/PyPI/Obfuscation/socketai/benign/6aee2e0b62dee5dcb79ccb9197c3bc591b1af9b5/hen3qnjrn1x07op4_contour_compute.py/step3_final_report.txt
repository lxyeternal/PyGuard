{
  "purpose": "The code performs spatial and geometric computations such as Delaunay triangulation, convex hull, and geodesic calculations, likely for spatial analysis or modeling purposes.",
  "sources": "Input data from function parameters, including spatial coordinate arrays and configuration options.",
  "sinks": "No external data exfiltration or network communication observed; data flows are internal within the functions.",
  "flows": "Data is read from inputs (coordinates, parameters), processed through geometric algorithms, and results are returned without external side effects.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of variable and function names, complex control flow, and dynamic handling of inputs. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns identified.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard spatial analysis routines such as convex hull, Delaunay triangulation, and geodesic calculations, with obfuscated variable names and complex logic. No evidence of malicious payloads, network activity, or data exfiltration. The obfuscation appears to be for code protection or size reduction rather than malicious intent. The control flow is intricate but aligns with legitimate geometric computations. The absence of external communication and malicious code patterns suggests benign behavior, though the obfuscation warrants cautious review in security-sensitive contexts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a complex but legitimate spatial analysis toolkit with significant obfuscation. No signs of malicious activity or sabotage are evident. The low malware and security risk scores are appropriate, though the obfuscation level suggests a need for careful input validation if used in critical environments.",
