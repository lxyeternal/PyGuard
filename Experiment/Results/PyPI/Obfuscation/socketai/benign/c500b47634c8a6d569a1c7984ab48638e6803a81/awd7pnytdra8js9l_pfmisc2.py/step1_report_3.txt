{
  "purpose": "This source code appears to be a placeholder or a comment block explaining usage of local dependencies and class constructors, likely serving as documentation or a stub for implementation.",
  "sources": "No actual code reads input or data; only comments and class declarations are present.",
  "sinks": "No data processing, input handling, or untrusted data flow present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows identified due to lack of executable code.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated-looking string 'Some WFxbTnTwGQokbWMkJxIjlLmJupzcwkNg' at the start, which appears to be intentionally obfuscated or random, but it is part of a comment. No other anomalies or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a descriptive comment block with no executable statements, input handling, or data flow. The random string at the beginning could be an obfuscation attempt or simply a placeholder, but it does not execute or alter behavior. No suspicious activity, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior is evident. The code appears to serve as documentation or a template.",
  "conclusion": "The code is non-executable and only contains comments, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It appears to be a placeholder or documentation snippet rather than functional code.",
