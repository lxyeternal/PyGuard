{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package, specifying dependencies and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads the Python version info from sys, reads 'README.rst' file, and uses static strings for setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "The setup function uses static strings; no untrusted data is processed or executed.",
  "flows": "The version check influences script termination; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "The function name appears obfuscated; no hardcoded credentials or malicious code evident. The string 'awd7pnytdra8js9l' is non-descriptive but appears as a package attribute.",
  "analysis": "The code verifies Python version compatibility and performs a standard package setup using setuptools. The function name is obfuscated, which could be suspicious, but it merely reads a file. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious logic detected. The static string 'awd7pnytdra8js9l' may be a unique identifier but not inherently malicious. No evidence of malware or malicious intent present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script with obfuscated function naming but no malicious behavior. No security risks or malware detected.",
