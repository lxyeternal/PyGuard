  "purpose": "Set up configuration for a Python package including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading the Python version info from sys, reading the README.rst file for long description.",
  "sinks": "None present that directly execute untrusted data or cause security harm.",
  "flows": "Python version check to sys, file reading from 'README.rst'.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual function name 'bdVNQFlDtTDQauKGoFjIezkjZbZLUBeO' which appears obfuscated; the code is generally straightforward, but the obfuscated function name is suspicious as it may hide malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a version check on Python, which is standard. It defines a function with a nonsensical name that reads a README file; this function is not invoked anywhere, so it appears benign. The setup() call contains package metadata and dependencies, with no apparent malicious code or hardcoded secrets. The obfuscated function name is suspicious but does not execute any malicious code or external actions. Overall, the code is minimal and mostly benign, with the only concern being the obfuscated function name, which could be a sign of intent to hide malicious code. However, as it is unused, it does not pose an immediate threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears primarily benign, serving as a package setup script with an obfuscated function name that could be a minor indicator of concealment. No malicious behavior or malware evident. The overall security risk is low.",
