  "purpose": "This code performs a Python version check, reads a README file, and calls setup() with static parameters for package installation.",
  "sources": "Reads the Python version info from sys.version_info; opens and reads 'README.rst' file.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; static data used in setup() parameters.",
  "flows": "Version info check -> read README -> call setup() with static parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function name and parameter names; function defined but not invoked; no malicious code or external data influence.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with superficial obfuscation. No malicious activity, external data exfiltration, network activity, or code injection detected. Obfuscation appears to be for concealment but does not indicate malicious intent. The function with obfuscated name is unused, and the setup parameters are static, indicating benign behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with superficial obfuscation. No evidence of malware or security threats is present. The obfuscation does not compromise security and appears to be stylistic or for evasion of detection rather than malicious intent.",
