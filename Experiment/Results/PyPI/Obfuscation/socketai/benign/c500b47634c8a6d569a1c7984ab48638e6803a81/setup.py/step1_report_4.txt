  "sinks": "setup() function parameters, particularly install_requires and scripts",
  "flows": "sys.version_info -> version check -> sys.exit (if Python < 3.5); open() -> return file content; setup() parameters -> package installation and execution",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names (e.g., vOdlvRvJausIEsUZKGzRrBBEcEtHBfob), but no suspicious behavior in logic or external calls",
  "analysis": "The code performs a Python version check and exits if the version is below 3.5. It defines a function to read a README file, likely used for long description (although not used in setup call). The setup() function is called with package metadata, dependencies, scripts, and licensing info. Variable names are deliberately obfuscated, but the core logic is standard for package setup. No malicious code, external data exfiltration, or suspicious activity detected. No hardcoded secrets or unsafe code practices identified.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup configuration for a Python package with obfuscated variable names. No evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks present.",
