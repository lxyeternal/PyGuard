  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated, feature-rich messaging utility with no current evidence of malicious activity. While the obfuscation warrants caution, the absence of malicious indicators suggests it is benign. The malware score should remain very low, and the overall security risk is minimal, though further review of the full implementation is recommended if additional code is available."
