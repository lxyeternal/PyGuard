  "purpose": "This code snippet is a shebang line indicating the script should be run with Python 3. It serves as a placeholder or script stub with no executable logic.",
  "sources": "The shebang line itself, which instructs the operating system to use Python 3 to run the script.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or untrusted data flows; the code contains no functions, data handling, or network operations.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows exist, as the code is only a shebang line with no additional logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a shebang line, which is a standard script header. All reports correctly identify that there is no executable logic, malicious behavior, or security risk. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are consistent with the code's simplicity. No vulnerabilities, data leaks, or malicious activities are detectable. The high confidence scores reflect certainty in this benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless placeholder with no malicious intent or security concerns. All reports are accurate and consistent. No adjustments to scores are necessary.",
