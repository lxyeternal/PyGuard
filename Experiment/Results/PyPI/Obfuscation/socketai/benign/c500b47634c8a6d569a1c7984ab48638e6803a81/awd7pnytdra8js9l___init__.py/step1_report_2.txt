  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python module or script, potentially for data processing or utility functions, with no immediately clear malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input data may come from user input, environment variables, or external files (not explicitly shown in the provided snippet).",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks could occur if data is printed, logged, or sent over network connections, but none are explicitly shown here.",
  "flows": "No evident source-to-sink data flows are observable in the provided code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. No unusual code patterns are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python script with standard syntax and structure. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, malicious network activity, or hidden backdoors. Usage of third-party libraries appears benign. No security-critical vulnerabilities like SQL injection or insecure handling of secrets are evident. The code's purpose seems to be utility-based or part of a larger application without malicious features.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or significant security risks. The code appears safe and well-structured, with no suspicious signals.",
