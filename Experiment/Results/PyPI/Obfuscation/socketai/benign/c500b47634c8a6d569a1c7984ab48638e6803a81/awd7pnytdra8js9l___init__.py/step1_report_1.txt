{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is to perform a specific function, likely related to data processing or system interaction, as indicated by its structure and imported modules.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input functions, environment variables, or external modules; specific source points need detailed inspection but are not explicitly shown here.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communication functions, file operations, or subprocess executions, which can lead to data leaks or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources through processing functions or variables, possibly reaching sinks such as network calls or file writes, but exact paths are not detailed in the provided snippet.",
  "anomalies": "There are no obvious hardcoded credentials or suspicious obfuscation techniques. The code structure appears standard, with no unconventional language features or misleading variable names. Absence of external suspicious domain connections or malicious backdoors is noted.",
  "analysis": "The code does not exhibit any signs of obfuscation, malicious backdoors, or malicious payloads. It uses typical Python constructs and libraries. Without explicit suspicious functions or data flows, it appears to be legitimate. However, the lack of detailed code makes comprehensive assessment limited. No hardcoded secrets or insecure practices are evident in the provided snippet.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with no evident malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. Confidence in this assessment is high given the limited and standard code structure.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
