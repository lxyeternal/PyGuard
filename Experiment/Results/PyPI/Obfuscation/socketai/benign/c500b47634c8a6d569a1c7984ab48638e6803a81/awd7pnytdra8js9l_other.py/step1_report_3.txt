Several functions directly invoke system commands (`os.popen`, `os.system`, `subprocess.Popen`) with arguments that could originate from untrusted sources, posing a risk of command injection if not properly sanitized. The presence of functions like `QjcvTclawJRjktRJKzRqAfSeVeZdrLQs`, `bUAGmCryHCrUuXYruWvsLOeHfwKrvWTj`, and `QuXpCNTvOoUybTOWOOUuipnoTjgqdyMo` execute shell commands and process output, which can be malicious if user input is used unsafely. Other parts of the code, such as file and directory manipulation functions, do not show clear malicious intent but could be exploited if combined with malicious inputs. Overall, the code does not contain explicit malware, but the use of system command execution functions with unvalidated inputs is a high-risk behavior indicating potential for malicious activity or abuse.\",\n  \"conclusion\": \"The code exhibits high potential for malicious behavior primarily due to unsafe system command execution with untrusted inputs. There are no obvious hardcoded secrets or backdoors, but the security risk associated with command execution functions is significant. This code should be reviewed thoroughly for input sanitization before use in any sensitive environment.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.8,\n  \"obfuscated\": 0,\n  \"malware\": 0.2,\n  \"securityRisk\": 0.75\n}",
