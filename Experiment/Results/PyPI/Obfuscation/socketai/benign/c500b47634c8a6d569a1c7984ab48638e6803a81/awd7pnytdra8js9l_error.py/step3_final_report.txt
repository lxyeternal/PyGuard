{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a stylized message formatting and logging utility, providing ASCII art boxes, error/warning messages, and control over process termination, primarily for debugging or user messaging.",
  "sources": "Input via function arguments, kwargs ('header', 'exitToOS', 'drawBox'), caller info obtained through 'inspect'.",
  "sinks": "Outputs to console via print(), process termination via sys.exit(), message display functions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters influence message content and control flags; caller info affects logging; outputs are generated based on these inputs.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with nonsensical class and variable names, complex string manipulations, dynamic message assembly, use of 'inspect' for environment info, and control flags affecting process termination.",
  "analysis": "The code is a heavily obfuscated utility for message formatting and logging, with functions controlling whether to display styled messages or terminate the process. No network activity, file operations, or malicious payloads are evident. The obfuscation and control over process exit could be misused but do not indicate malicious intent by themselves. The use of 'inspect' is standard for debugging purposes. The absence of hardcoded secrets, code injection, or data exfiltration points suggests low likelihood of malware. The high obfuscation score reflects deliberate complexity to hinder analysis, but behavior remains benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a complex, obfuscated logging and message display utility with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain sabotage. Its primary function is benign, though obfuscation warrants cautious review if integrated into larger systems. The malware score is low, and the security risk is minimal, primarily due to obfuscation and control flow flags.",
