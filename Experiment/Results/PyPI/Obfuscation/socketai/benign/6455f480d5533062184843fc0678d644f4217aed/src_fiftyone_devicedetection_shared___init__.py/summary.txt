  "conclusion": "The code appears mostly benign with low malware and obfuscation scores. The primary concern is the potential use of eval/exec, which warrants a slightly higher malware score. Adjusting the malware score for Report 4 to 0.4 and maintaining a risk score of 0.4 provides a balanced assessment. Overall, the dependency poses minimal security threat, but vigilance is advised if eval/exec is present."
