{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script possibly intended for data processing or utility functions, but without additional context, its primary purpose cannot be definitively determined.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from environment variables, function parameters, and potentially external modules or files.",
  "sinks": "Data is passed to functions, outputted, or stored; no direct untrusted data sinks like network connections or file writes with untrusted input are evident.",
  "flows": "Data from environment variables or inputs flows through functions and may be processed or returned; no suspicious data flow paths are apparent.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are observed. The code structure is straightforward, and no unusual language features are used.",
  "analysis": "The code is clean and appears to implement typical functions for data manipulation or utilities. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors. It mainly interacts with environment variables and function parameters, with standard control flow. Absence of suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated sections suggests a benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the analysis, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It seems to be standard utility code with no indicators of compromise or malicious intent.",
