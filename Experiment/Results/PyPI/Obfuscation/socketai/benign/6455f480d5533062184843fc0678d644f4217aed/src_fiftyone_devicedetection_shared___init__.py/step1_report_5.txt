  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some data processing or utility functions, but the specific goal cannot be determined definitively from the provided snippet.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from environment variables and possibly from external files or network sources (if any present).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, network connections, file writes, or evaluation/execution functions, if used.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources such as environment variables or files towards processing functions, and then potentially to output or system calls.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies or suspicious behaviors such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or hidden backdoors are present. The code appears straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "A detailed review of the code shows standard import statements, normal data handling, and no use of dynamic execution, suspicious network activity, or obfuscated logic. No malicious behavior is detected. Usage of third-party libraries is typical and does not raise suspicion. There are no indications of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious commands.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears benign, with no anomalies or malicious behaviors detected.",
