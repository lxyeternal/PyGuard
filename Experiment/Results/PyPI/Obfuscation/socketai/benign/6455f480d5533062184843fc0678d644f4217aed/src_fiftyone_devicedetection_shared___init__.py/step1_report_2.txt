  "purpose": "This code appears to perform standard data processing or utility functions; no explicit purpose is evident from the provided fragment.",
  "sources": "Reads input from environment variables, file I/O, or function parameters.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to console, files, or network connections; potential for data exfiltration if untrusted data is transmitted.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or input functions to sinks like print statements, files, or network calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code constructs are observed. No obfuscated code or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Python constructs and library functions. No signs of malicious behavior, such as network connections to suspicious domains, system manipulation, or data theft. The code appears benign and typical for utility scripts. No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The security risk appears low based on the provided fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code shows no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be standard application code with no suspicious activity.",
