  "purpose": "Retrieve environment variable values using a key, checking both original and uppercase forms.",
  "sources": "Environment variables accessed via os.environ.get with provided key and its uppercase variant.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; code only reads environment variables without writing or transmitting data.",
  "flows": "Input: key parameter; flow to environment variable retrieval; no data leaks or external effects.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names; no other unusual code patterns or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with obfuscated naming and a static method that retrieves environment variables based on a key, checking both the original and uppercase forms. It performs a straightforward environment variable lookup without any side effects, network activity, or malicious operations. The obfuscation could be a red flag but is not inherently malicious. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning a malware score of 0 and low security risk (~0.2), with high confidence (~0.8-1). The obfuscation score (~0.7) reflects the naming but does not imply malicious intent. No signs of malicious data flow, code injection, or sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign environment variable accessor with obfuscated identifiers. While obfuscation warrants caution, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality.",
