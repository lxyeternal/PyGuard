{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this code is to retrieve environment variable values based on a provided key name.",
  "sources": "Input is read from environment variables via os.environ.get() using the provided key_name and its uppercase variant.",
  "sinks": "The data retrieved from environment variables could potentially be used downstream for further processing or decision making, but no direct sink like network transmission or file writing is present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The flow involves receiving a key_name as input, converting it to uppercase, and fetching the corresponding environment variable value.",
  "anomalies": "The code employs a class with a static method solely for fetching environment variables. No anomalies, suspicious logic, or hardcoded secrets are present. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with a static method that retrieves environment variable values based on a given key. It attempts to get the value using the key as-is, and if not found, retries with the uppercase version of the key. There are no external inputs other than environment variables, and no data sinks or malicious behaviors identified. The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple utility for accessing environment variables, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It appears to serve a legitimate purpose within a larger application.",
