{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define various data structures, including user-agent headers, query parameters, structured user-agent JSON, and hashes/filenames related to hashes and user agent data.",
  "sources": "Data structures containing user-agent headers, query parameters, and hash/filename strings. No external input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network requests, file writes, or system commands are present. No malicious data leaks or system modifications are observable.",
  "flows": "The data is stored in variables; no data flows to other components, functions, or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of base64-encoded string, structured JSON strings, and hash/filename variables could be used for obfuscation or data encoding, but on their own, they do not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of static data definitions: user-agent headers with typical browser identifiers, encoded query parameters, structured JSON data, and hash/filename strings related to hashing and user agent datasets. There are no functions, network operations, or system modifications. The presence of encoded strings and structured data may suggest preparation for further processing or obfuscation, but without additional context, these are benign. No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious network addresses, or malicious logic are detected. The code does not exhibit signs of malware or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It appears to be configuration or data storage code without any suspicious operations or security issues.",
