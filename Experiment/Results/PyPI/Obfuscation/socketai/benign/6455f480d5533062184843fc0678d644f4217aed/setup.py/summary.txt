  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with superficial obfuscation. There is no evidence of active malware or malicious intent, but the obfuscation and suspicious parameter names warrant caution. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; a slightly higher malware score (~0.3) and obfuscation score (~0.75) are justified due to the obfuscated argument and variable names. Overall, the code appears benign but warrants further source verification before trust."
