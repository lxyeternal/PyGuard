  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'fiftyone_devicedetection_shared', configuring metadata and package details for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading 'version.txt' and 'readme.md' files, importing setuptools and os modules.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data directly, such as network or file output using untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Reads version and readme files, then passes their contents to setup() for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains obfuscated variable names (e.g., xiYapDfEPLxaJZnnsYNLypEppggMjxcb, hJoqasPxDEypSXVhXGJQnXdmSFegZKap, xvZATkIPfSKpwJRJkrbHyIUfasJtrxgH), which are unusual and suggest possible obfuscation or attempts to hide intent. The try-except block in 'read' returns '0.0.0' on failure, which could mask errors, but is not malicious itself.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup configuration for a Python package, with a custom read() function to load file contents. However, it uses non-descriptive, obfuscated variable names, which could be a sign of obfuscation or malicious intent. No network, file modification, or credential handling is present. The code does not perform any suspicious actions beyond normal package setup procedures. The obfuscation alone raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. Overall, the code appears to be a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names, possibly to conceal details or prevent easy analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a package setup script with obfuscated variable names. There are no direct malicious actions or suspicious behavior detected. The obfuscation could be innocent or an attempt to hide malicious code, but based on available content, it appears to be a normal setup script with low risk. Confidence is moderate due to the obfuscation.",
