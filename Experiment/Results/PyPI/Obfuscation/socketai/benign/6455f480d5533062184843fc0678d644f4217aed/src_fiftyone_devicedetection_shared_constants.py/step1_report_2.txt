  "purpose": "Defines a class with constants related to evidence query prefixes and separators, and constructs some string constants based on imported constants.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'fiftyone_pipeline_cloudrequestengine.constants' and class attributes referencing those constants.",
  "sinks": "String concatenations involving imported constants; no untrusted input handling observed.",
  "flows": "Import of external constants -> class attribute definitions -> string concatenations using imported constants.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The constants are constructed straightforwardly from imported constants.",
  "analysis": "The code imports constants from an external module and uses them to construct string values. The construction appears to be for query prefixes or separators. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, obfuscated code, or network activity. The code is simple, with no user input handling or insecure operations. The variables and concatenations seem to serve a configuration or setup purpose. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign configuration or constant definitions without malicious intent or security issues. No malicious behavior or sabotage is evident.",
