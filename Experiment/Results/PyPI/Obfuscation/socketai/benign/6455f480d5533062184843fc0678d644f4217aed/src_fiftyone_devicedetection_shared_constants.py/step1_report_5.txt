{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class with constants that appear to construct query strings using imported constants and hardcoded values.",
  "sources": "Import from 'fiftyone_pipeline_cloudrequestengine.constants' and the hardcoded strings within the class.",
  "sinks": "Concatenation of constants and hardcoded strings potentially forming query or command strings.",
  "flows": "Imported constants and hardcoded strings are combined to produce query-like strings.",
  "anomalies": "The class contains obfuscated or non-descriptive class and variable names; use of constants combined with hardcoded strings suggests possible obfuscation or attempt to hide intent. No clear security-sensitive data or credentials are present. No suspicious code behavior such as network activity, file operations, or cryptography.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a constants module and defines a class with two string attributes. These attributes concatenate imported constants with hardcoded strings, potentially forming query or command strings. Variable and class names are obfuscated, which could be suspicious, but they do not indicate malicious behavior by themselves. The use of imported constants to build strings is common; no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms is present. No input or output operations are visible. The code seems to serve a simple purpose of constructing strings, likely for queries or configuration, without any malicious context.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be an obfuscated class that constructs strings from constants and hardcoded values, likely for query formation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based on this fragment. The obfuscation and naming may be intended to hide the code's purpose but do not inherently indicate malicious intent.",
