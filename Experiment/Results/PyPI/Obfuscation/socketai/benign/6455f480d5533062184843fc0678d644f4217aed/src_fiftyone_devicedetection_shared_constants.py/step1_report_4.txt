  "purpose": "Define a class that constructs specific string constants based on imported core constants.",
  "sources": "Import from 'fiftyone_pipeline_cloudrequestengine.constants' and use of class attributes to generate strings.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no untrusted data sources or external effects are visible.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; only static string concatenation occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The class name and attribute names appear obfuscated and do not reveal clear purpose. The imported constant is used to build query-like strings, which may be suspicious if it originates from untrusted code or if the strings are used in sensitive contexts, but nothing concrete is shown here.",
  "analysis": "The code imports constants from a module and defines a class with attributes that generate strings by concatenating imported constants with hardcoded strings. The import path appears legitimate, and the strings are simple concatenations. There are no functions executing untrusted input, no network calls, or file operations. The obfuscated naming could suggest an attempt to hide intent, but with the limited context, it appears as standard string manipulation. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity is evident. The purpose seems to be related to forming query strings, possibly for evidence or model identifiers.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet. The obfuscated class and attribute names are suspicious but not inherently malicious. The code's function appears to be static string construction, which is generally safe. However, further context about how these strings are used would be necessary for a comprehensive assessment.",
