  "purpose": "Constructs query strings by concatenating imported constants with hardcoded strings, likely for internal query formation.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'fiftyone_pipeline_cloudrequestengine.constants' and class attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "String concatenation operations used to build query strings; no external sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Imported constants + hardcoded strings → class attributes holding concatenated results.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names; no malicious code or secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward string concatenation of imported constants and hardcoded strings to form query components. Obfuscation of names suggests concealment but no malicious behavior. No network, file, or sensitive data handling is present. The pattern indicates internal configuration or query string construction, with no signs of malicious activity or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as an internal utility for string construction. Obfuscation is notable but not malicious. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, low security risk, high obfuscation) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
