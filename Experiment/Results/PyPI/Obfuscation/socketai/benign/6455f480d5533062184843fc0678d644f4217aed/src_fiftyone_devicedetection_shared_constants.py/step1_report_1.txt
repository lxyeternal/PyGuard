{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class that constructs certain query strings by concatenating constants and hardcoded strings, likely for internal use in data querying or processing.",
  "sources": "Imports from an external module 'fiftyone_pipeline_cloudrequestengine.constants', specifically 'EVIDENCE_QUERY_PREFIX' and 'EVIDENCE_SEPERATOR'. The class attributes are then constructed using these constants and hardcoded strings.",
  "sinks": "String concatenation results stored in class variables; no immediate sinks such as network calls or file writes are present.",
  "flows": "Constants imported → String concatenation with constants and hardcoded strings → Assigned to class variables.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class name and variable names (e.g., IwpeSYrABnatwGFbmhJWCJxrJLiNWcOP) suggests intentional obfuscation or code concealment. The code constructs query-like strings, but the purpose is not explicitly malicious. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. No unusual or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports constants from an external module, then defines a class with attributes that concatenate these constants with hardcoded strings. The obfuscated class and variable names could be intended to conceal intent, but the code itself appears to build query strings for internal use. There are no network operations, no code injection points, and no obvious malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration or backdoors. The lack of external calls or sensitive data handling indicates low risk, though obfuscation warrants attention.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be an obfuscated internal component that constructs query strings using imported constants and hardcoded strings. There is no evidence of malicious intent or behavior. The obfuscation might be for code concealment or organizational purposes but does not inherently indicate malicious activity.",
