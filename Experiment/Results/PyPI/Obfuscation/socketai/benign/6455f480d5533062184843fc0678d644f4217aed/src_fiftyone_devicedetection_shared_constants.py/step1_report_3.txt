  "purpose": "Defines a class with constants that build query strings using imported constants and hardcoded string parts.",
  "sources": "Import of constants from an external module; usage of class attributes and hardcoded strings.",
  "sinks": "Potential concatenation of external constants with hardcoded strings, which could be used in query or command construction.",
  "flows": "Import constants -> class attribute assignments -> concatenation of constants and strings.",
  "anomalies": "Use of imported constants without visibility into their contents; no evident malicious code or obfuscation. No sensitive data or credentials are hardcoded. No dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code imports constants from an external module and defines a class with attributes that concatenate these constants with hardcoded strings. The purpose appears to be constructing query or identifier strings. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code is straightforward and structurally simple, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. Without additional context on the imported constants, no malicious intent can be inferred.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign, primarily defining string constants for potential use elsewhere. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet.",
