      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with superficial obfuscation. There is no evidence of active malware or malicious intent, but the obfuscation and suspicious parameter names warrant caution. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; a slightly higher malware score (~0.3) and obfuscation score (~0.75) are justified due to the obfuscated argument and variable names. Overall, the code appears benign but warrants further source verification before trust."

      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code appears mostly benign with low malware and obfuscation scores. The primary concern is the potential use of eval/exec, which warrants a slightly higher malware score. Adjusting the malware score for Report 4 to 0.4 and maintaining a risk score of 0.4 provides a balanced assessment. Overall, the dependency poses minimal security threat, but vigilance is advised if eval/exec is present."

      "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a collection of utility functions with obfuscated names and a logical flaw in type validation. There is no evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The obfuscation and flawed logic are superficial and do not elevate the security risk significantly. The code is benign, serving as utility processing routines, with a low malware likelihood and minimal security concern."
