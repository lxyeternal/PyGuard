{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform peptide cleavage, filtering, isotopic analysis, and modifications detection, likely for mass spectrometry data analysis in proteomics.",
  "sources": "Input data streams include peptide sequences, mass shift arrays, parameter dictionaries, and Series/DataFrame objects for mass and isotope information.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive sinks include data filtering and matching operations, and database queries to Unimod for modifications, but no clear data exfiltration or system modification points are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through analysis functions—peptide sequences and mass shifts are processed to identify modifications, isotopes, and filters, with no evident external network communication or system alteration.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains repeated placeholder descriptions and inconsistent formatting, but no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code constructs. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is mainly a set of function descriptions and parameter explanations for peptide processing and analysis. It references external databases (Unimod), performs mass matching and filtering, and handles peptide sequences. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or system access. The functions described do not perform network operations, file manipulations, or system commands. Overall, the code appears to be standard data processing for proteomics analysis with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of peptide mass spectrometry analysis tools with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs data filtering, isotope matching, and modification detection in a straightforward manner. There are no signs of malware or security risks.",
