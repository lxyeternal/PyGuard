{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform peptide cleavage, mass shift analysis, isotope matching, and modification identification related to proteomics data processing.",
  "sources": "Input data includes peptide sequences, mass shift data, and parameters for parsing CSV files and Unimod database queries.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include data filtering, matching mass shifts, and returning filtered dataframes or lists, with no evidence of unsafe data handling or untrusted input exploitation.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (peptides, mass shifts, parameters) through processing functions involving mass matching, isotope detection, and modification identification, resulting in data outputs such as filtered dataframes or lists.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs observed. No obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity, or hidden behaviors. The functions and comments are consistent with standard proteomics analysis tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets are mainly function descriptions and parameter documentation for peptide processing, mass shift analysis, isotope matching, and modification lookup. There is no executable code, malicious payload, or suspicious data flow. The functions are designed for scientific data processing with well-defined inputs and outputs. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, hidden network calls, or obfuscated logic are present. The code appears to be part of a legitimate bioinformatics pipeline.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for proteomics data analysis, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It mainly consists of descriptive comments and parameter definitions for functions. There is no evidence of malware, sabotage, or malicious behavior.",
