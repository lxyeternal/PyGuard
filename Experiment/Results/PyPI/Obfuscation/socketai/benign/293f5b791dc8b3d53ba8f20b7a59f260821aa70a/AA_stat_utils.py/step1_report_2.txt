{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for peptide analysis, including cleavage, filtering, isotope finding, and modification matching, primarily for proteomics data processing.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as peptide sequences, mass shifts, data handlers, and configuration dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "Potentially outputs filtered DataFrames, dictionaries with mass shifts, and lists of modifications or amino acids; no direct data leaks or untrusted data processing identified.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through processing functions, involving mass calculations, regex rules, and database lookups, with no evident malicious control flow or untrusted data exploitation.",
  "anomalies": "The code snippets are incomplete, mostly docstrings and parameter descriptions without actual executable code. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. No suspicious network activity, system modification, or privacy violations observed.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be part of a proteomics analysis toolkit, utilizing standard data processing methods such as regex matching, data filtering, and database lookups (Unimod). It operates on known scientific data structures and parameters. No malicious or suspicious logic is present. The code structure is typical for scientific data analysis modules, with clear documentation and no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. As the actual executable logic is not provided, the assessment relies on the documentation and parameter descriptions, which do not suggest malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippets and documentation, there is no evidence of malware, malicious activity, or security risks. The code appears to be standard scientific processing code for peptide analysis. The overall security risk is low.",
