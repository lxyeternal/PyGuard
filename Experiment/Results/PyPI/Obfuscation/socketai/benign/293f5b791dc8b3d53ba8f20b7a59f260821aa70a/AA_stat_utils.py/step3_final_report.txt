{
  "purpose": "The code performs proteomics data analysis including peptide cleavage, mass shift detection, isotope matching, and modification identification, primarily for scientific research purposes.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as peptide sequences, mass shifts, and data from external databases like Unimod; data structures like Series, DataFrames, and numpy arrays.",
  "sinks": "Filtered DataFrames, lists, and dictionaries containing processed peptide and modification information; no data leaks or external communications are indicated.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through processing functions involving mass calculations, isotope detection, and modification matching, resulting in filtered or annotated data outputs.",
  "anomalies": "Documentation inconsistencies and placeholder-like descriptions, but no suspicious code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are evident.",
  "analysis": "The provided descriptions indicate standard scientific functions for proteomics analysis. No executable code snippets are present to analyze for malicious behavior. The functions rely on common libraries and data structures, with no signs of network activity, code injection, or system modifications. The documentation's cluttered nature suggests poor maintenance but not malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, low risk) are consistent with the described code and typical for scientific modules. No vulnerabilities or malicious routines are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, standard proteomics data processing toolkit with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The low scores are justified given the context. Overall, it is safe for use in its intended scientific environment.",
