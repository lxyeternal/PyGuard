{
  "purpose": "Process localization data and amino acid modifications, primarily retrieving and analyzing dataframes and calling utility functions for mass spectrometry data.",
  "sources": "Dataframes 'locmod_df' and 'ms_stats()', 'peptides()' methods, and the 'utils' module functions.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data exfiltration points; internal logging and data formatting only.",
  "flows": "Data is read from dataframes and passed through utility functions; no external or untrusted data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data retrieval and processing for scientific analysis, with logging for debugging. No network activity, code injection, or malicious patterns are present. Utility functions appear to serve internal formatting and logging purposes. The code is clear, well-structured, and purpose-specific, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward scientific data processing code with no security threats or malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk approximately 0.1) are justified and appropriate given the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
