{
  "purpose": "The code appears to process localization data, peptide modifications, and mass spectrometry statistics, likely for proteomics analysis.",
  "sources": "Reading localization data from locmod_df, accessing data.ms_stats(), data.peptides(ms), and utils.internal() for logging and mass formatting.",
  "sinks": "Calls to utils.internal() for logging information and formatting mass data; no apparent sinks that process untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Localization data retrieved from locmod_df and used for decision-making; peptide statistics obtained from data.ms_stats() and data.peptides(). No external untrusted data sources are directly involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code patterns detected. The code uses standard library functions and a utils module presumed to be legitimate.",
  "analysis": "The code performs localization data extraction, logs debug information, processes mass spectrometry statistics, and formats mass data. It does not contain any obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or suspicious data flows. The logging uses standard practice, and data handling appears straightforward. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful system commands are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard data processing script for proteomics analysis with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It solely performs data retrieval, logging, and formatting functions.",
