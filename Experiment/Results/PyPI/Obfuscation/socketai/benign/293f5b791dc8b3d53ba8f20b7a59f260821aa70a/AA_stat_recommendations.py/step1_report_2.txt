{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions for processing localization data, calculating modifications, and determining fixed modifications based on peptide data.",
  "sources": "Reads localization data from locmod_df, input parameters mslabel, aa, data, params_dict, choices, and external utils functions.",
  "sinks": "Uses utils.internal for logging and mass_format, which may output or process data, but no untrusted data sinks are apparent.",
  "flows": "Localization data is retrieved from locmod_df to determine top localization; peptide data is used to calculate amino acid counts; utils functions process and format data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Use of logger.debug is standard for debugging. No obfuscated or unusual code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code accesses localization information and peptide statistics for amino acids, then logs debug info. The only external interaction is via utils functions and logging. No user input or external data sources are directly referenced; code appears to perform standard data processing tasks. No suspicious or malicious patterns, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads, are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward data processing related to peptide modifications. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. It appears safe and purposeful within a biological data analysis context.",
