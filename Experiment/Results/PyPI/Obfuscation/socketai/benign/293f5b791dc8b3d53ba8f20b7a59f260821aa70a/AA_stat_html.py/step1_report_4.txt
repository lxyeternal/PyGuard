{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple Python script intended for demonstration or utility purposes, but without specific comments or documentation, the exact intent is unclear.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the user via input() functions and accesses environment variables using os.environ.",
  "sinks": "Data is printed to the console using print(), and environment variables are accessed without validation. No external network connections or file writes are detected.",
  "flows": "Input from user or environment variables flows into variables that are subsequently printed or used internally. No untrusted data flows into external systems or sensitive areas.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code structure is straightforward, with no unusual language features or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes variables with input() and environment variables, then prints data. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system modification, or network activity. Usage of environment variables and user input appears benign. No complex or obfuscated logic is present, and no external dependencies indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a benign script mainly for input/output operations, with no signs of malware or malicious data handling.",
