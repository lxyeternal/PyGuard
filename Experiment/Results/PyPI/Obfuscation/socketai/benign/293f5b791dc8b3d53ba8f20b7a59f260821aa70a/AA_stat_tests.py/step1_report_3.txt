{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform some form of data processing or utility functions, but without specific context or comments, the exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from environment variables and possibly external inputs such as files or network requests, though no explicit sources are evident in the snippet.",
  "sinks": "Data could potentially be sent to network endpoints, written to files, or used in system commands; however, no explicit sinks such as network calls or file writes are shown in the provided code.",
  "flows": "The code does not clearly demonstrate data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; it mainly performs local computations or variable manipulations.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation are present. The code uses standard constructs without suspicious dynamic execution or obfuscated segments.",
  "analysis": "Step-by-step review indicates standard coding practices with no signs of malicious behavior. The code does not contain any suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or credential theft mechanisms. It mainly performs calculations or data handling within safe boundaries. Without external context or external calls, there is no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The code appears benign with no suspicious patterns or anomalies.",
