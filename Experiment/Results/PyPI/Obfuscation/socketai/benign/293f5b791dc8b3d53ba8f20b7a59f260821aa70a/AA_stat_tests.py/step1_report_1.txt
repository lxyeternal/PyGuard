  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to perform some form of data processing or interaction with external systems.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables and possibly from user input or network sources, depending on implementation details.",
  "sinks": "The code potentially writes data to external systems, files, or network endpoints; uses sensitive data in logs or outputs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or input sources through processing functions, potentially leading to external sinks such as network or file systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code patterns, or obfuscated code detected. No unusual language features or dynamic execution present. Structure appears typical for a Python script.",
  "analysis": "The code reads data from environment variables and performs standard processing steps. No signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or unauthorized system access. Usage of third-party libraries is standard, with no suspicious activity. No obfuscated or malicious logic detected. Code structure is straightforward, with no evident attempts to conceal behavior. Data flows are typical and do not suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this code. It appears to be a normal Python script with no indicators of malware or supply chain compromise.",
