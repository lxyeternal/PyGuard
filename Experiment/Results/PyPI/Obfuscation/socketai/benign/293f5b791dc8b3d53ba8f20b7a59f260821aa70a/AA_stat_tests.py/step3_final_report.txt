  "purpose": "Evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Code reading input data, environment variables, class attributes, potential data leaks via __repr__.",
  "sinks": "Potential data exposure through __repr__, external calls, network connections, file modifications.",
  "flows": "Input sources (environment variables, data attributes) to sinks (__repr__, external calls).",
  "anomalies": "Potential data leakage via __repr__, no malicious code detected, no obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code appears benign with no malicious activity or obfuscation. Potential data leakage via __repr__ is noted but not malicious. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0 are justified. Security risk is low (0.2), with a slight increase to 0.3 for report 4 due to data exposure concern. Confidence levels are high where code is present and benign, low where no code exists. Overall, the assessments are consistent and appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows no evidence of malware or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to potential data exposure, which is a design consideration rather than an active threat. Scores are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
