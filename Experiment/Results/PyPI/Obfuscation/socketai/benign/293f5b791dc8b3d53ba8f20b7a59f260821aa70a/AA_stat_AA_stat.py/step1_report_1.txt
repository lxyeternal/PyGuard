{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a collection of functions for analyzing peptide sequences, calculating amino acid statistics, mass shifts, and related statistical analyses within proteomics research.",
  "sources": "Data inputs such as peptide lists, dataframes, series, dictionaries, and parameters provided to functions.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks involving untrusted data leading to data leaks or malicious actions. No network or system modifications detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (peptide lists, dataframes, series, dictionaries) through calculations and statistical functions without external system interaction or data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. No suspicious code execution, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution observed. The code is primarily computational and data analysis oriented.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple functions for peptide and amino acid analysis, involving standard data processing, statistical calculations, and bootstrap methods. No evidence of malicious behavior such as network communication, system modification, or secret exfiltration. The code structure is typical for scientific computing and data analysis. There are no signs of obfuscation or malware indicators. It is purely analytical, with no suspicious code segments or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a legitimate scientific analysis module for proteomics data. It performs statistical calculations on peptide sequences and related data without any malicious intent or harmful behavior. There are no signs of malware or security risks present. The code is standard for its purpose and contains no suspicious anomalies.",
