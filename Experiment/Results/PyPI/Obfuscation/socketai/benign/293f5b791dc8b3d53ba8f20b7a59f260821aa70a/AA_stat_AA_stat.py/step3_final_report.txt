{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for amino acid statistics, peptide analysis, in silico cleavage, bootstrap p-value calculations, and data merging within proteomics research workflows.",
  "sources": "Functions read input data from parameters such as peptide lists, dataframes, series, and dictionaries; no external data sources or untrusted inputs are explicitly processed.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or network communications; data is processed internally and results are returned as data structures or tables.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through computational functions, with no external or untrusted data sources or sinks; primarily internal data transformations.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of repetitive placeholder-like string ('QrYTduTBKhiizhNxAhxHHizwRudlcEWT') in descriptions and parameter comments, suggesting placeholder content or obfuscation; no executable malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of scientific functions for peptide and amino acid analysis, with descriptive docstrings and parameter annotations. No suspicious code patterns, network activity, or malicious behaviors are present. The placeholder string appears in documentation and parameter descriptions, which may indicate incomplete code, dummy data, or obfuscation. No hardcoded credentials, code injection, or data leakage mechanisms are evident. The high obfuscation score in some reports is justified by the placeholder text, but no actual malicious obfuscation or malware is detected. Malware risk is consistently low (0), and security risk remains minimal (around 0.2), reflecting the benign nature of the code despite placeholder content.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate scientific analysis routines for proteomics data, with no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The repeated placeholder string suggests incomplete or placeholder content, leading to a moderate obfuscation score but not indicating malicious intent. Overall, the code is safe for use, with a very low security risk, provided the placeholder content is clarified or replaced in production.",
