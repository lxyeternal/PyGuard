  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate scientific analysis routines for proteomics data, with no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The repeated placeholder string suggests incomplete or placeholder content, leading to a moderate obfuscation score but not indicating malicious intent. Overall, the code is safe for use, with a very low security risk, provided the placeholder content is clarified or replaced in production."
