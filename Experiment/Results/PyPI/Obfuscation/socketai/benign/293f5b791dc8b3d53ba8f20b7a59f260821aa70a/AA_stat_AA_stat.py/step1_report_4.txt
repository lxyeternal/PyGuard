{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform amino acid analysis, statistical calculations, peptide processing, and mass shift analysis related to proteomics data, with no explicit malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include peptide lists, DataFrames, Series, and dictionaries such as mass_shift_data_dict, err_ref_df, reference, results, data, reference_label, params_dict.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include calculations involving dataframes and series, statistical functions, and possible output generation (though no direct data exfiltration or system modification observed).",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (peptide lists, dataframes, series, dicts) through statistical processing, peptide cleavage, and mass shift analysis functions, culminating in output of statistical tables, p-values, and figures.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns identified. No use of dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual language features are present. The code is mostly descriptive and structured for data analysis.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of functions and parameter descriptions aimed at analyzing peptide sequences and mass shifts. There are no indications of external network activity, file modifications, or data exfiltration. All functions serve standard scientific data processing purposes. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious data handling, or hidden behaviors are observed. The code appears to be part of a proteomics analysis pipeline without malicious components.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical scientific data analysis script related to amino acid statistics and mass shift analysis. It contains no suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware indications. It is a benign component of a bioinformatics workflow.",
