The obfuscation is superficial and does not elevate the threat level. The assigned scores are appropriate and reflect a benign package configuration with obfuscation and minor coding issues."

The obfuscation does not currently constitute a security threat but should be clarified. Overall, the security risk and malware scores are appropriate, with a slight concern for the placeholder strings."
