  "purpose": "To evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and anomalies based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Input data sources, code snippets, data flows, network interactions, environment variables, and any code execution points.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network transmissions, file modifications, or system calls that could lead to security issues or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Paths from data sources (inputs) to sinks (outputs or system modifications), including any suspicious data handling or code execution routes.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, suspicious network domains, obfuscated code, or unexpected behavior not typical for benign scripts.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify the absence of code or malicious indicators, assigning low or zero scores for malware and obfuscation. The confidence levels are appropriate, with higher confidence when code is analyzed and lower when no code is provided. The risk scores are minimal, reflecting the low likelihood of malicious activity given the available information. The reasoning is consistent, and no significant anomalies are detected. The scores align with the described content, and the cautious approach is justified.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided reports, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scoring is appropriate, and the analysis is justified. No adjustments are necessary unless new code or context emerges.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
