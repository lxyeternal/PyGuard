{
  "purpose": "The code is designed for spectral analysis, peptide modification localization, and spectrum matching in proteomics research.",
  "sources": "Input peptide sequences, experimental spectra, amino acid mass dictionaries, modification data, and dataframes for localization analysis.",
  "sinks": "No external untrusted data sources or network interactions; data flows are internal and processing-based.",
  "flows": "Input data (peptides, spectra, modifications) are processed through functions that compute theoretical spectra, preprocess experimental spectra, and perform localization, with no external data leaks or malicious data flows.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of nonsensical strings like 'QrYTduTBKhiizhNxAhxHHizwRudlcEWT' used as labels or keys, suggesting placeholder or obfuscation; no active malicious code or network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard proteomics analysis tasks, including spectrum calculation, preprocessing, and localization. The suspicious strings are likely placeholders or obfuscation, not malicious payloads. No signs of code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated ~0.2, risk ~0.2) are consistent with the evidence, reflecting low threat but some suspicion of placeholder text.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate scientific analysis software with some placeholder or obfuscation elements that do not indicate malicious intent. No active malware or security vulnerabilities are present. The suspicious strings should be clarified or replaced in production environments to avoid misinterpretation.",
