{
  "purpose": "The code is designed for spectral analysis, peptide modification, and mass spectrometry data processing, primarily for scientific research purposes.",
  "sources": "It reads peptide sequences, modification data, experimental spectra, and amino acid mass information from input parameters and data structures.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks for untrusted data leading to security vulnerabilities; the code does not write sensitive data or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (peptide sequences, modifications, spectra) through processing functions that generate spectra and localization scores; no external or untrusted data is sent or received.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behavior, backdoors, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code are detected. The code appears to be standard scientific processing routines.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises multiple function docstrings describing spectral calculations, data preprocessing, modification localization, and candidate scoring. It uses standard data structures like dicts, lists, and DataFrames, with no evident insecure practices. There are no network operations, eval calls, or obfuscated sections. The parameters involve sensitive scientific data but do not contain hardcoded secrets. Overall, the code appears to be legitimate scientific processing code without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a scientific spectral analysis and peptide modification tool with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It processes data internally without external communication or insecure practices.",
