{
  "purpose": "The code is designed for spectral analysis, peptide modification localization, and theoretical spectrum calculations in proteomics research.",
  "sources": "Input data includes peptide sequences, experimental spectra, modifications, and amino acid masses. Data is read from function parameters and external files for spectra and DataFrames.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include functions that process spectrum data, perform matching, or modify peptide information, but no direct sinks (e.g., network or file writing) are evident.",
  "flows": "Input data (peptide, spectrum, modifications) flows into spectrum processing and matching functions; results are used for localization and scoring. No explicit data flow to external systems or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors are observed. The code appears standard for proteomics spectral analysis; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code fragment is a set of function descriptions and parameters related to spectral analysis and peptide modification localization in proteomics. It includes standard procedures such as spectrum processing, theoretical spectrum generation, and localization scoring. No indications of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity, are present. The functions operate solely on scientific data relevant to peptide mass spectrometry analysis, with no signs of malware or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears legitimate and typical for scientific proteomics workflows. There are no signs of malicious intent, suspicious behaviors, or security risks. It is a standard implementation for spectral analysis and peptide modification localization with no vulnerabilities or malicious features detected.",
