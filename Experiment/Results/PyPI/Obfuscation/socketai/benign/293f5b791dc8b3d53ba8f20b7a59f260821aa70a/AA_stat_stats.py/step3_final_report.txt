{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for smoothing data, fitting Gaussian peaks, and plotting amino acid statistics within proteomics analysis workflows.",
  "sources": "Input arrays and parameters such as observed mass shifts, amino acid data, and configuration dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "Processed data outputs, plotting functions, and fitted models; no untrusted data sinks or network operations detected.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into smoothing and fitting routines, with results used for plotting and statistical analysis; no suspicious source-to-sink paths identified.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of nonsensical or obfuscated strings like 'QrYTduTBKhiizhNxAhxHHizwRudlcEWT' and 'fKpXUjTauoGKGFzQhqnwMbqQbCUUqZKw' within comments or docstrings, likely placeholders or obfuscation artifacts.",
  "analysis": "The code consists mainly of descriptive docstrings and parameter explanations for scientific functions. No executable logic or malicious code is present. The strange strings suggest placeholder or obfuscation use but do not indicate active malicious behavior. The absence of network activity, hardcoded credentials, or system modifications supports a benign assessment. The obfuscation appears superficial, not involving active concealment or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign scientific analysis code with some placeholder or obfuscated comments. No evidence of malware or malicious intent is detected. The obfuscation does not currently constitute a security threat but should be clarified. Overall, the security risk and malware scores are appropriate, with a slight concern for the placeholder strings.",
