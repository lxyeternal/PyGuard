{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform data smoothing, peak fitting with Gaussian functions, and amino acid statistics plotting within a proteomics or mass spectrometry data analysis pipeline.",
  "sources": "Input data includes arrays of observed mass shifts, amino acid statistics data, localization counters, and parameters from argument parsing or parameter dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include plotting functions and saving data to specified directories; no evident data leaks or insecure operations are visible.",
  "flows": "Data flows from raw observed mass shifts and amino acid statistics into smoothing functions, Gaussian fitting, and plotting routines, with parameters guiding these processes.",
  "anomalies": "The code snippets are primarily docstrings and parameter descriptions without actual implementation code. There are no hardcoded credentials, suspicious code patterns, or unusual behaviors apparent.",
  "analysis": "The provided code consists solely of descriptive docstrings outlining functions for smoothing, Gaussian peak fitting, and plotting amino acid statistics. There are no executable code blocks, dynamic code execution, or suspicious operations present. The comments describe standard data analysis procedures typical in scientific workflows. No anomalies, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior are identifiable. The apparent purpose is scientific data processing, not system manipulation or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available information, the code appears to be standard scientific analysis code with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It mainly involves data smoothing, Gaussian fitting, and plotting, with no suspicious activities detected.",
