{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a set of functions for smoothing data, fitting Gaussian peaks, plotting amino acid statistics, and handling mass shift data in peptide analysis workflows.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters, including arrays of mass shifts, amino acid statistics, and localization counters.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks where untrusted data influences system or leaks identified; no network operations, file writes, or sensitive data transmission detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through processing functions for smoothing, peak fitting, and statistical plotting, but no untrusted data appears to influence security-critical operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code is mostly descriptive and functionally oriented with no obfuscated language features or unusual code structures. The comments include random strings, but that appears to be part of placeholder text rather than malicious obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists mainly of descriptive comments and parameter definitions for data processing functions related to peptide mass spectrometry analysis. No evidence of code injection, hardcoded credentials, or malicious logic. The comments include random strings but do not seem to serve any malicious purpose. The functions operate on numerical and statistical data with no network or file system interactions, and there are no suspicious function calls or code flows that suggest malware or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical data analysis script with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. The comments contain some placeholder text but do not indicate malicious obfuscation or backdoors. Overall, it appears safe and benign.",
