      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated setup script that enforces a specific build argument. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The obfuscation is minor and not malicious. The enforcement of 'sdist' could hinder some workflows but does not pose a security threat."
