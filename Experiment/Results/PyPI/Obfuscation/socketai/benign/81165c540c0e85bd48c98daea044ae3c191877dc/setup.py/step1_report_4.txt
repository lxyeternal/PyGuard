  "purpose": "The script enforces installation of the 'grpcio' package during source distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv, hardcoded string with installation instruction.",
  "sinks": "Potentially raises RuntimeError to block installation if conditions are not met.",
  "flows": "Checks sys.argv for 'sdist' and raises error with installation message if not present.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a randomly named variable; no actual malicious code or suspicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys and setuptools, defines metadata and a message string. It raises an error to enforce installation during source distribution. No data leaks, obfuscation, or malicious activities are evident. The logic is straightforward and only involves installation enforcement.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign installation check with no malicious intent. It merely enforces the presence of a package during source distribution without any suspicious behavior or security risks.",
