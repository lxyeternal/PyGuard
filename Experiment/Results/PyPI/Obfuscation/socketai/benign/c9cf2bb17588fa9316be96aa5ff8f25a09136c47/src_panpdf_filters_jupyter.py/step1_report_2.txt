It modifies internal macro behavior and package loading.\",\n  \"anomalies\": \"The code modifies \\everymath to include \\displaystyle globally, which can affect mathematical rendering. The conditional package load for 'underscore' is standard. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are present.\",\n  \"analysis\": \"The code sets \\everymath to append \\displaystyle, influencing all subsequent math environments to render in display style. It then checks if the 'underscore' package is loaded; if not, it loads it with the 'strings' option. These are standard LaTeX macro modifications and package management commands. There is no evidence of malicious intent such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code is well-formed and typical for LaTeX customization.\",\n  \"conclusion\": \"The code is a standard LaTeX macro and package management snippet with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply modifies math formatting and manages package loading.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.9,\n  \"obfuscated\": 0,\n  \"malware\": 0,\n  \"securityRisk\": 0\n}",
