  "obfuscated": 0.35,
  "confidence": 0.75,
  "conclusion": "The overall assessment indicates low to moderate malicious intent suspicion, primarily due to obfuscation and dynamic code patterns. The current scores are reasonable; however, increasing malware suspicion marginally for reports 4 and 5 enhances accuracy. No definitive malicious activity is confirmed, but vigilance is advised."
