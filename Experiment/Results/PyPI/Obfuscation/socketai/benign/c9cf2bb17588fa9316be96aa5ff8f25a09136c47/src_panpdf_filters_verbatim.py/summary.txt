  "conclusion": "The initial high scores in Report 1 are not fully justified without direct code evidence; a more cautious malware and obfuscation score of 0.4 is appropriate. The other reports are consistent with benign assessments. Overall, the suspicion in Report 1 warrants further detailed static and dynamic analysis, but current scores should reflect the evidence more conservatively."
