  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code patterns, behaviors, and practices.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, user inputs, dynamic imports, eval statements, and file/network operations.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, and potential code execution points such as eval and import.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources like environment variables or user inputs through functions like eval or dynamic import to sinks such as network transmission, file system, or code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval and dynamic import without validation, potential obfuscation hints, lack of code in some reports, and suspicious practices like hardcoded credentials or backdoors not explicitly observed.",
  "analysis": "The reports generally identify benign code with no explicit malicious activity. Reports 1-4 show standard, non-suspicious patterns with low malware and risk scores. Report 5 highlights the use of eval and dynamic import, which are risky practices that could be exploited maliciously, justifying a moderate security risk score. The malware scores remain low across all reports due to the absence of confirmed malicious payloads. The confidence levels reflect the certainty of the observations, with higher confidence in benign assessments and moderate confidence in risky practices. Overall, the scoring aligns with the code behaviors and practices described.",
  "conclusion": "Most code is benign with appropriate low malware and obfuscation scores. Report 5's unsafe practices warrant a higher security risk score but do not confirm malicious payloads. The assessments are consistent and justified based on the provided code snippets and behaviors.",
