  "conclusion": "The analysis confirms that Report 1's high malware and risk scores are justified by the presence of unsafe code patterns indicative of malicious behavior. Other reports correctly reflect low or zero risk due to lack of suspicious activity or absence of code. No adjustments are necessary; the scores are consistent with the evidence and descriptions."
