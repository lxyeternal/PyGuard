  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, no obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The provided text is a usage instruction with an example command for a command-line tool (likely 'panpdf') that interacts with Pandoc. It instructs how to pass additional options after a double dash, which is standard for command-line argument passing. There is no executable code, no code injection, no data processing, and no indication of malicious behavior or backdoors. It simply describes command-line options.",
