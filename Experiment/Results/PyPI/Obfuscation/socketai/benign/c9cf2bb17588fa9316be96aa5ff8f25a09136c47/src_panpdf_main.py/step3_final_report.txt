  "purpose": "Static documentation and command-line instruction snippets with embedded random strings, likely placeholders or obfuscation.",
  "sources": "Embedded strings within static text and command examples.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows; static text only.",
  "flows": "No active data flow; static content.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of random-looking strings (e.g., UlQKovxrZOMxYXEAIaAXYXBFgNivqGjn) embedded in documentation, suggestive of placeholders or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets are static documentation with no executable logic. The random strings are suspicious but do not perform any actions or data processing. Malware scores are correctly set to 0, as no malicious activity is evident. Obfuscation scores are modest (around 0.2-0.3), reflecting suspicion but not malicious intent. Security risks are minimal, consistent with static documentation. The presence of placeholder-like strings does not indicate active threats but warrants noting as potential obfuscation or placeholders.",
  "conclusion": "The snippets are benign documentation with some suspicious placeholder or obfuscation elements. No active malicious behavior or code execution is detected. The current scores are appropriate; minor adjustments are unnecessary.",
