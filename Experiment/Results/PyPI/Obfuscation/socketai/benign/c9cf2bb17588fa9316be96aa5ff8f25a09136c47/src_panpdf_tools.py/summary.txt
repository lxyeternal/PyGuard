  "conclusion": "The code is a set of document processing utilities with superficial obfuscation and no evidence of malicious activity. The malware score is set to 0, reflecting no malicious intent. The obfuscation score is moderate (0.6), justified by variable name obscurity. The overall security risk is low (0.2), consistent with utility functions that do not perform harmful actions."
