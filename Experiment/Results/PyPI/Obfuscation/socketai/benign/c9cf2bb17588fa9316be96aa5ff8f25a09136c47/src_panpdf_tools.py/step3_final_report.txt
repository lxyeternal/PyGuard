  "purpose": "Utility functions for file handling, pandoc command execution, document processing, YAML configuration management, and resource handling within document workflows.",
  "sources": "Functions reading environment variables, invoking subprocesses (e.g., pandoc, ffmpeg), reading/writing files, YAML parsing, and document metadata access.",
  "sinks": "External command execution (pandoc, ffmpeg), file creation/modification, YAML file reading, and resource path manipulations.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (e.g., environment variables, file contents, YAML data) flow into subprocess calls, file operations, or metadata modifications without evidence of malicious payloads.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, dynamic resource path handling, and external command invocation; no hardcoded secrets or network activity; superficial obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of utility functions for locating external tools, managing temporary files/directories, reading/writing YAML configurations, and document processing via panflute and pandoc. Obfuscated variable names suggest intentional concealment but do not indicate malicious intent. No signs of network activity, data exfiltration, backdoors, or sabotage are present. External commands are standard for document workflows. The code handles resource cleanup and configuration management securely. The obfuscation is superficial and typical for code that aims to conceal complexity but not malicious behavior. The functions operate within expected parameters for document processing utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of document processing utilities with superficial obfuscation and no evidence of malicious activity. The malware score is set to 0, reflecting no malicious intent. The obfuscation score is moderate (0.6), justified by variable name obscurity. The overall security risk is low (0.2), consistent with utility functions that do not perform harmful actions.",
