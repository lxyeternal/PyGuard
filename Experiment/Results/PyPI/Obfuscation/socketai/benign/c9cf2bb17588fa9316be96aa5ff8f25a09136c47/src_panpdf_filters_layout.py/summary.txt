  "conclusion": "The scores in Report 1 are justified given the signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution. Other reports are consistent with their benign or incomplete status. The overall supply chain risk is moderate (~0.3), primarily due to the suspicion in Report 1. The high risk score in Report 3 should be adjusted downward to reflect its benign nature."
