{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple Python script that performs basic input handling and possibly some computation or data processing.",
  "sources": "Input functions (e.g., input() or reading from environment variables or files), external data sources, command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Potentially print statements, network connections, or file writes if present, which could output untrusted data or leak information.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions to output sinks, possibly including unsafe data handling or evaluation.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code snippets are identified. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are present. The code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code lacks complex logic, obfuscated features, or suspicious network activity. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system modification, or remote command execution. The structure suggests a benign purpose, possibly for basic data handling. Since no malicious or suspicious patterns are observed, the code appears to be a standard, safe script.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the analysis, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It seems to be a normal, benign script with no signs of malware or security threats.",
