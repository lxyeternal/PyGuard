  "conclusion": "Overall, the dependency appears low risk with no confirmed malicious activity. However, due to signs of obfuscation and dynamic code execution in some reports, a cautious approach is advised. Increasing the malware score for report 2 from 0.2 to 0.5 better reflects potential hidden risks. The other reports are consistent with their low-risk assessments."
