      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a complex, obfuscated build configuration script with no evidence of malicious activity or malware. The obfuscation and source file manipulation are suspicious but not malicious. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score should remain at 0. The obfuscation score is justified around 0.7, and the risk score around 0.2, consistent with the analysis."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "Overall, the dependency appears low risk with no confirmed malicious activity. However, due to signs of obfuscation and dynamic code execution in some reports, a cautious approach is advised. Increasing the malware score for report 2 from 0.2 to 0.5 better reflects potential hidden risks. The other reports are consistent with their low-risk assessments."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The overall assessment indicates that the majority of the code shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, warranting cautious handling. Report 2 is the most concerning, with high malware and risk scores justified by suspicious patterns. Other reports are either benign or indicate moderate suspicion. The scores are aligned with the evidence, and no adjustments are necessary at this stage."

      "conclusion": "The code samples across all reports are predominantly benign, with no confirmed malicious activity or obfuscation. The risk scores are cautiously set at 0.2, reflecting minimal inherent vulnerabilities. Unless explicit eval/exec usage is identified, the malware score remains at 0. The reports are consistent with their findings, and no further action is necessary."
