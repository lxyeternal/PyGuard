  "conclusion": "The code is a complex, obfuscated build configuration script with no evidence of malicious activity or malware. The obfuscation and source file manipulation are suspicious but not malicious. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score should remain at 0. The obfuscation score is justified around 0.7, and the risk score around 0.2, consistent with the analysis."
