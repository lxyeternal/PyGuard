  "purpose": "Configure setup for a Python package build, including environment setup, conditional logic for different build types, and module discovery.",
  "sources": "os.uname() for system info, sys.argv for command-line arguments, imports for environment setup, find_python_sources() for source discovery.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no direct data leaks or untrusted data flows observed.",
  "flows": "Environment detection and conditional setup lead to different module imports and configurations, but no untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names (e.g., cfWyZuBnmndoJeHyCuFhecTSrJJakCGD, XjTgcZhrmCbHsNVVQxzRAOsjSFmFfkJx, etc.) potentially to hide intent or complexity; unusual code structure with multiple conditional branches. Import of a potentially custom or obscure function find_python_sources. No obvious hardcoded secrets or malicious code segments.",
  "analysis": "The script configures environment and build settings based on system and command-line inputs. It imports standard and possibly custom modules for environment setup and source discovery. Obfuscated variable names suggest an attempt to conceal the code's intent. There is no evidence of malicious actions such as data exfiltration, remote code execution, or system manipulation. The conditional logic is typical for build scripts, though the obfuscation and custom module usage merit cautious review. Overall, the code appears to be standard build configuration with some obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily manages build configuration and environment setup for a Python package. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident. The obfuscation and custom module usage are unusual but do not necessarily indicate malicious intent. Overall, the script appears benign with a low likelihood of malicious activity.",
