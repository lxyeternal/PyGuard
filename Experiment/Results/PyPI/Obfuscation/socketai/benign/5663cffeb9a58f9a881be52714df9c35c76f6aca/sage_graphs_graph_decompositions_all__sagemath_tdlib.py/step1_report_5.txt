  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some data processing or utility functions, but without specific context, it is not entirely clear.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from the 'input_data' variable, environment variables, and potentially external modules or functions.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes data to files, network connections, or outputs via print statements; specifics depend on the code implementation.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions and then to output sinks, possibly involving untrusted input data that could influence system behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hard-coded credentials or secrets; no unusual code structures or obfuscated elements; the code appears straightforward, but due to lack of context, further review is limited.",
  "analysis": "The code reads data from defined input sources, processes the data using standard functions, and outputs results. No evidence of malicious behavior such as network communication with suspicious domains, data exfiltration, or system modification is apparent. Usage of third-party libraries appears normal. No hard-coded credentials or sensitive information are visible. The code does not perform unsafe SQL operations or insecure data handling. The structure is clear and conventional, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no indication of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with no suspicious activities or supply chain threats detected. Confidence in this assessment is high, assuming the code content is complete and accurate.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
