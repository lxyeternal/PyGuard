  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and anomalies based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Code input/output handling, environment variables, data processing functions, dynamic code execution points (eval/exec), hardcoded secrets.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows leading to code execution, data leakage, or external network communication.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input functions or environment variables flow into processing functions; potential sinks include eval/exec calls, network transmissions, or file modifications.",
  "anomalies": "Potential dynamic code execution (eval/exec) without explicit evidence, placeholder or empty code sections, minimal security risk scores despite potential concerns, consistent low malware and obfuscation scores.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate either benign code or lack sufficient data for analysis. Reports 1, 2, 4, and 5 show no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior, with scores reflecting low risk. Report 3 mentions eval/exec as a concern but concludes no explicit usage; unless such functions are confirmed, malware remains at 0. The risk scores are generally low (0.2), justified by the minimal inherent risks. Confidence levels are high where code is present, and low where code is absent or placeholder. No anomalies indicating malicious intent are detected. Overall, the assessments are consistent and appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The code samples across all reports are predominantly benign, with no confirmed malicious activity or obfuscation. The risk scores are cautiously set at 0.2, reflecting minimal inherent vulnerabilities. Unless explicit eval/exec usage is identified, the malware score remains at 0. The reports are consistent with their findings, and no further action is necessary.",
