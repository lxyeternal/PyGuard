  "conclusion": "The code samples across all reports are predominantly benign, with no confirmed malicious activity or obfuscation. The risk scores are cautiously set at 0.2, reflecting minimal inherent vulnerabilities. Unless explicit eval/exec usage is identified, the malware score remains at 0. The reports are consistent with their findings, and no further action is necessary."
