  "conclusion": "The overall assessment indicates that the majority of the code shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, warranting cautious handling. Report 2 is the most concerning, with high malware and risk scores justified by suspicious patterns. Other reports are either benign or indicate moderate suspicion. The scores are aligned with the evidence, and no adjustments are necessary at this stage."
