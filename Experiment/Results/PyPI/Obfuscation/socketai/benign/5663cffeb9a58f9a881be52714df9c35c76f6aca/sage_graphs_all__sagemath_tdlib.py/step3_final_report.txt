  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code patterns, obfuscation, dynamic execution, and suspicious behaviors.",
  "sources": "Untrusted data sources such as environment variables, user inputs, external files, and network interfaces; code execution points like eval, exec, subprocess calls.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file system modifications, subprocess executions, data exfiltration points, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs, environment variables) into sinks (eval, subprocess, network), potentially via dynamic code execution or obfuscation techniques.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, unnecessary dynamic execution, suspicious imports, hardcoded credentials or URLs, lack of comments, unusual code structure.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, with some patterns indicating potential malicious intent such as untrusted data handling and suspicious imports. Reports correctly identify these patterns, assigning higher malware and risk scores where appropriate. Benign reports lack suspicious patterns and are scored accordingly. The scores across reports are consistent with the described behaviors, with Report 2 showing the highest suspicion due to untrusted data and eval/exec usage. No definitive malicious payloads are confirmed; suspicion is based on code patterns and behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The overall assessment indicates that the majority of the code shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, warranting cautious handling. Report 2 is the most concerning, with high malware and risk scores justified by suspicious patterns. Other reports are either benign or indicate moderate suspicion. The scores are aligned with the evidence, and no adjustments are necessary at this stage.",
