  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a specific task or functionality, but without the code snippet provided, the exact purpose cannot be determined.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are not explicitly visible due to lack of code, but typical sources could include user input, environment variables, files, or network data if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include data transmission over network sockets, writing to files, executing system commands, or handling sensitive data such as credentials or environment variables.",
  "flows": "Without the actual code, specific source-to-sink paths cannot be identified. Generally, untrusted data flows from sources to sinks if present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies can be identified without the code. Typical anomalies to watch for would include hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "Due to the absence of provided code, a detailed step-by-step analysis cannot be performed. Normally, this involves reviewing input points, data processing, and output points for malicious or insecure patterns.",
  "conclusion": "No code provided for analysis, so no malicious behavior or security risks can be confirmed. Additional code context is needed to proceed.",
