  "purpose": "Reads version from 'pyproject.toml' with obfuscated variable names.",
  "sources": "File system path construction and file reading of 'pyproject.toml'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; local file read only.",
  "flows": "Constructs path -> opens file -> reads lines -> searches for 'version' -> returns version string.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated variable and function names; no malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a path to 'pyproject.toml' in the parent directory, reads the file line-by-line, searches for a line containing 'version', and extracts the version string. Exception handling ensures a default value of 'Unknown' if reading fails. The obfuscated naming is superficial and does not indicate malicious intent. No network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration is present. The logic is straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for extracting version information from a configuration file. No malicious activity or security threats are evident. The obfuscation is superficial and does not imply malicious intent.",
