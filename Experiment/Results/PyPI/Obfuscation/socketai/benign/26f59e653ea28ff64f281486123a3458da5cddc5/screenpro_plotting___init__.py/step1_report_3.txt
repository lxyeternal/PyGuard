{
  "purpose": "The code appears to import specific functions from local modules related to plotting, likely for data visualization in a scientific or bioinformatics context.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules 'numpy', 'scanpy', and local modules '.qc_plots' and '.pheno_plots', specifically functions within those modules.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or perform potentially dangerous actions; the code only imports functions.",
  "flows": "No data flows or execution flows involving untrusted input; the code only sets up imports.",
  "anomalies": "The imported function names from local modules are highly obfuscated, consisting of seemingly random strings, which is unusual and suspicious. The use of non-descriptive, obfuscated function names could indicate attempts to hide malicious intent or make reverse engineering difficult.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries 'numpy' and 'scanpy', which are common in data analysis and bioinformatics workflows. It then imports functions from local modules with obfuscated names, which is suspicious. These functions may perform visualization tasks, but the obfuscated naming suggests possible concealment of their true purpose. There are no visible inputs, outputs, or execution logic beyond imports. The lack of any executable code or data processing makes it difficult to assess further malicious activity, but the obfuscated function names are a red flag for potential malicious intent or covert behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists solely of import statements, but the obfuscated function names in local modules raise suspicion. There are no obvious malicious actions or data leaks within this snippet; however, the obfuscated imports could be a sign of hidden malicious behavior or attempts to evade detection. Overall, the risk is moderate due to obfuscation, but no definitive malicious activity is evident.",
