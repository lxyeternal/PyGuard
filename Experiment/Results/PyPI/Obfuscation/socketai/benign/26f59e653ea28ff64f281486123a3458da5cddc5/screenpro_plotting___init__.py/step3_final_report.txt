{
  "purpose": "Import statements for numpy, scanpy, and local modules with obfuscated function names, likely for data processing or visualization.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from external libraries and local modules with obfuscated function names.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows are present; code does not process input or output data.",
  "flows": "No execution or data flow observed; only static imports.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of highly obfuscated function names which are nonsensical and suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with obfuscated function names, indicating potential concealment. No malicious actions, data leaks, or insecure operations are evident. The obfuscation raises suspicion but is not definitive of malicious intent. Scores assigned across reports reflect high obfuscation (0.7-0.8), with malware likelihood at zero or very low (0-0.2). The security risk remains low (0.2), consistent with the absence of active threats. Further review of the actual function implementations is recommended to confirm benignity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign in purpose, serving as import statements with obfuscated identifiers. The high obfuscation warrants caution, but no evidence of malicious activity is present. Scores are appropriate; malware likelihood is minimal, and overall security risk is low. Continued scrutiny of the actual function code is advised to ensure safety.",
