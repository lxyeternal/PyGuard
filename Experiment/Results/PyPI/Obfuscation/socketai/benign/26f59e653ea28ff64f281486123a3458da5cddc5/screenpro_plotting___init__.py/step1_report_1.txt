{
  "purpose": "This code imports popular scientific computing libraries (numpy, scanpy) and local modules for plotting functions, likely for data analysis and visualization in a biological context.",
  "sources": "Imports from external libraries (numpy, scanpy) and local module functions (qc_plots, pheno_plots). No direct input or data reading shown in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks such as network connections, file writing, or system commands are present in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flows or source-to-sink pathways are visible in this code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "Imported functions have obfuscated or nonsensical names, which is unusual and might suggest obfuscation or placeholder names. No other suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard scientific libraries used for data analysis in Python. It also imports functions from local modules with intentionally obfuscated names, which is atypical and raises suspicion of obfuscation or malicious intent. However, there are no obvious malicious actions, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors such as network activity, file manipulation, or code injection. The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose in data visualization, but the obfuscated function names warrant further review.",
  "conclusion": "The code is likely legitimate in functionality but contains obfuscated function names, which could be an attempt to conceal malicious behavior or simply a form of code obfuscation. No direct malicious activity or security risks are evident in this snippet.",
