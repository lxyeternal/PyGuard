{
  "purpose": "The code imports essential data analysis libraries and specific functions from local modules, likely for quality control and phenotype plotting in a data analysis pipeline.",
  "sources": "Imports from external libraries 'numpy' and 'scanpy', and local modules '.qc_plots' and '.pheno_plots' functions.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data, user input, or external communication; no network operations or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "Imports are static and do not involve data flow from untrusted sources; the imported functions could be called elsewhere, but no such calls are shown here.",
  "anomalies": "Function names imported from local modules are obfuscated or nonsensical, possibly to hide their true purpose; no other suspicious code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code solely performs static imports of external libraries and functions from local modules with obfuscated names. There are no data processing, input handling, or network activities observed in this fragment. The obfuscated function names could indicate an attempt to conceal malicious intent or simply code obfuscation. Without further code execution or data manipulation, there is no evident malicious behavior or security risk in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard import statement block with obfuscated function names. No malicious activity or security issues are identifiable based on this fragment alone. The obfuscation of function names warrants further review of the actual function implementations in the modules to ensure they are not malicious, but this cannot be determined from the current code snippet.",
