  "conclusion": "The code appears benign in purpose, serving as import statements with obfuscated identifiers. The high obfuscation warrants caution, but no evidence of malicious activity is present. Scores are appropriate; malware likelihood is minimal, and overall security risk is low. Continued scrutiny of the actual function code is advised to ensure safety."
