{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up visualization tools using matplotlib, including defining color maps and configuring plot spines and ticks.",
  "sources": "Imports from matplotlib, numpy, pandas; color map creation; function parameters and local variables.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly write or transmit data; no network operations or data exfiltration points are evident.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only configures plot appearance without processing external input.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names (e.g., RbAbDvHFthNuDyzlHauFMZBEqXYMCdkw) and functions with verbose, non-descriptive names. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious strings found. No malicious code behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily focuses on setting up visualizations with matplotlib: creating custom colormaps, defining a function to configure plot spines and axes visibility, and setting plot aesthetics. Variable names are intentionally obfuscated, but the logic is standard for plot configuration. No network activity, data manipulation, or other suspicious operations are present. The code appears to be benign setup code for plotting, with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration script for matplotlib visualizations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The obfuscated variable names do not imply malicious intent, and the code does not perform any harmful actions.",
