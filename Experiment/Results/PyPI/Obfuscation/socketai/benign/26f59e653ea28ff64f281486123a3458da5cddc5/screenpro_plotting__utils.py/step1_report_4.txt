{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up visualization parameters, including color maps and grid/axis visibility for plotting with matplotlib.",
  "sources": "Import statements for matplotlib, numpy, pandas; assignment of color hex strings; creation of colormap objects; function definition for customizing plot grid and spines.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks or data outputs; no untrusted data handling, network connections, or file operations observed.",
  "flows": "Imports -> Variable assignments (colors and colormaps) -> Function definition for plot styling.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names (e.g., RbAbDvHFthNuDyzlHauFMZBEqXYMCdkw), which is uncommon in standard code but not necessarily malicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic present. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation techniques detected.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly focuses on defining color maps and a styling function for plots. The variable names are intentionally obfuscated, which might suggest an attempt to hide intent, but their usage is straightforward and limited to plot styling. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data theft, or backdoors. The obfuscation appears superficial and does not hide malicious logic. The function 'KlqWIoEdFJKkVevyqmhhxNvQEKRzJeOK' simply adjusts plot aesthetics without executing untrusted code or external commands.",
  "conclusion": "This code is primarily concerned with plot styling and color configuration. Despite the obfuscated variable names, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be benign configuration code for data visualization.",
