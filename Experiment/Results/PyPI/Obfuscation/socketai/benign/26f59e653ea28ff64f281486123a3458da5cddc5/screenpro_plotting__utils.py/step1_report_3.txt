{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up visualization tools using matplotlib, including defining custom colormaps, colors, and plot styling functions.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (matplotlib, numpy, pandas); color definitions; colormap creation; function for plot styling and grid configuration.",
  "sinks": "None of the code contains typical sinks such as network communication, file operations, or system calls; functions only modify plot appearance.",
  "flows": "Data flows from colormap definitions and plot styling functions but does not involve untrusted input or data transformation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names (e.g., 'RbAbDvHFthNuDyzlHauFMZBEqXYMCdkw', 'kUBkgGbryBHbzPmUAosHkxuPcvIObVxv') which is unusual for standard code; no clear purpose for such naming; no dynamic code execution or suspicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes colormaps, colors, and styling functions for plots. No input parsing, network operations, file I/O, or system commands are present. Variable naming is deliberately obscure, which could be a sign of obfuscation, but it is consistent with benign code designed to make reverse engineering harder. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are detected. The code is purely for visual configuration. No anomalies suggest malicious intent, but the obfuscation warrants a cautious low confidence in benign intent solely based on code content.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign visualization setup code with obfuscated variable names. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior, only configuration of plot aesthetics. The obfuscation is unusual but does not imply malicious intent.",
