  "purpose": "Setup for matplotlib visualization aesthetics, including colormaps and plot styling.",
  "sources": "Code reads no external input; defines color schemes and styling functions internally.",
  "sinks": "No data leaks, network activity, or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code only configures plot parameters without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated variable names; no other unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports visualization libraries, defines color maps, and a styling function for plots. No input handling, network activity, or malicious code is present. Obfuscated variable names are superficial and do not indicate malicious intent. The code's purpose is solely aesthetic configuration, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only visualization setup. Obfuscation is superficial; no malicious activity or security risks are present.",
