  "conclusion": "The code is standard data processing code with a significant security consideration regarding pickle usage. If the pickle files or filenames are influenced by untrusted sources, this could lead to arbitrary code execution. No active malicious behavior or obfuscation is detected. The risk is primarily from unsafe pickle handling, which should be addressed by validating or avoiding untrusted pickle data. The overall malware score should be low (0), with a moderate security risk (~0.2-0.3) if filenames or pickle data are externally influenced."
