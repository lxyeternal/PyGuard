  "flows": "Import of the function from the module, then immediate execution of that function",
  "anomalies": "The function name appears to be a nonsensical, obfuscated string; no other code or comments indicate purpose or intent",
  "analysis": "The code imports a single function with a highly obfuscated name from a local module and immediately calls it. The obfuscation suggests an attempt to hide functionality. Without access to the function definition, it is unclear what actions are performed. The pattern is typical of malicious payloads aiming to hide malicious code, but it could also be an intentionally obscure implementation. No other suspicious code or data sources are evident. The import path is local, limiting immediate external risk, but the obfuscated function might perform malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal and obfuscated, which raises suspicion. It likely intends to conceal malicious or unwanted behavior within the imported function. Without inspecting the function's implementation, the risk cannot be definitively determined, but the pattern warrants caution.",
