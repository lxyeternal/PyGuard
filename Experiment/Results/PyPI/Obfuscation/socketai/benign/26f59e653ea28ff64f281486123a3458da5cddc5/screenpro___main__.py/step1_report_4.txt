  "purpose": "Import and execute a possibly obfuscated function from the local module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module (from .main import ...).",
  "sinks": "Execution of the imported function OAHeaqRIYOHsQwoAHjESQlHxmhLVOoqg().",
  "flows": "Import statement loads code; the subsequent call executes the imported function.",
  "anomalies": "The function name 'OAHeaqRIYOHsQwoAHjESQlHxmhLVOoqg' appears randomly generated or obfuscated. The import path is relative, but no additional context is provided. No parameters are passed, so execution relies entirely on the imported function.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function with a non-descriptive, seemingly random name from a local module and then executes it immediately. The randomness or obfuscation of the function name raises suspicion of hiding malicious intent or code obfuscation. Without inspecting the imported function's implementation, the actual behavior cannot be fully assessed. The code's minimal nature and lack of context limit definitive conclusions but indicate potential obfuscation or malicious intent due to the uninformative naming.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly minimal and uses obfuscated identifiers, which is suspicious and common in malicious or obfuscated code. It imports and executes a function whose purpose is unclear. Due to lack of context and the obfuscated nature, there is a moderate to high suspicion of malicious intent, but this cannot be confirmed without analyzing the imported function's implementation.",
