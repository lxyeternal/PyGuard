  "purpose": "Import and invoke a function from a local module within the package",
  "sources": "The import statement from .main, which loads a symbol named 'OAHeaqRIYOHsQwoAHjESQlHxmhLVOoqg'",
  "sinks": "Calling the imported function 'OAHeaqRIYOHsQwoAHjESQlHxmhLVOoqg()'",
  "flows": "Import from local module -> call to the imported function",
  "anomalies": "The function name 'OAHeaqRIYOHsQwoAHjESQlHxmhLVOoqg' appears obfuscated or randomly generated, which is suspicious. No other code or context is provided, making the purpose unclear.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a symbol with an obfuscated name from a local module named 'main' and immediately calls it. The obfuscated name suggests potential hiding of malicious intent or code, as it does not convey meaningful function purpose. Without access to the implementation of 'OAHeaqRIYOHsQwoAHjESQlHxmhLVOoqg', it is impossible to determine if the function performs malicious actions. The code is minimal and lacks context, which can be a red flag for obfuscation or malicious intent. No external data sources or untrusted inputs are involved directly.",
  "conclusion": "The code's simplicity and the obfuscated function name suggest possible malicious intent or hiding of functionality, but there is no definitive evidence within this snippet alone. The suspicious naming warrants further investigation of the 'main' module and the function's implementation.",
