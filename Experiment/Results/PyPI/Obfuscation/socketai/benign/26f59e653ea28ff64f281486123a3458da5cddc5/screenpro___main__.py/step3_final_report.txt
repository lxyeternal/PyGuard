{
  "purpose": "Detect potential malicious behavior or sabotage in the obfuscated import and invocation pattern of a Python module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .main module, the obfuscated symbol 'OAHeaqRIYOHsQwoAHjESQlHxmhLVOoqg', and its immediate invocation.",
  "sinks": "The invoked function/object could execute malicious code, access system resources, or perform unauthorized actions.",
  "flows": "Import from .main -> invoke the obfuscated symbol -> execution of potentially malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated symbol name, minimal code structure, immediate invocation without context, no parameters or comments.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a nonsensical, obfuscated symbol from a local module and immediately executes it. This pattern is suspicious, often associated with obfuscated or malicious payloads. The high obfuscation score (around 0.8) is justified, and the immediate invocation pattern is a red flag. Without inspecting the implementation of the imported symbol, malicious intent cannot be confirmed, but suspicion is high. The malware score should be increased from 0.4 to 0.6 to reflect this suspicion, and the overall risk score should be elevated to 0.6 to account for the pattern's potential danger. The code's minimalism and obfuscation warrant further analysis, including inspecting the 'main' module's implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The pattern of importing and executing an obfuscated symbol is suspicious and potentially malicious, warranting further investigation. Current scores are reasonable but should be adjusted to reflect higher suspicion, especially increasing malware and risk scores. The code's obfuscation and immediate execution pattern are red flags, though definitive maliciousness requires inspecting the actual implementation of the imported function.",
