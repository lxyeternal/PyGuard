{
  "purpose": "The code provides data visualization functions, primarily for scatter plots with annotations, used in statistical or biological data analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads data from pandas DataFrames, especially filtering based on labels, and imported local modules (_utils, _rank).",
  "sinks": "Uses matplotlib to generate plots; no external data transmission or system modification observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from DataFrame filtering (sources) into plotting functions (sinks), with no external communication.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of variable and function names; local module imports with obscure names; no comments or documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of plotting routines that filter data based on labels and generate scatter plots with annotations. No network activity, file I/O, or system modifications are present. Obfuscation may be stylistic or an attempt to conceal complexity but does not inherently indicate malicious intent. The imported modules' content is unknown; they could contain malicious code, but no evidence is present here. The functions are standard for data visualization, with no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of data visualization utilities with significant obfuscation but no evidence of malicious activity. The malware score is set to 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2). The obfuscation warrants caution, but based solely on this snippet, it does not constitute a security threat.",
