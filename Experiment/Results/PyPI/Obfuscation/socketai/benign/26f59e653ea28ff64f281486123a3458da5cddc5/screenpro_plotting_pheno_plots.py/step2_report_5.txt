  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their conclusions with the code and assessing the scores.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code is heavily obfuscated, with non-descriptive variable and function names.\n- It imports local modules (`_utils`, `_rank`) with seemingly random names, which could hide malicious code.\n- The functions are primarily for plotting scatter plots, filtering dataframes, and adding annotations.\n- No external data fetching, network communication, or file I/O is evident.\n- The logic appears to be standard for data visualization, especially in bioinformatics/statistics contexts.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correctly identifies the code as visualization functions, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscation & imports:** Notes obfuscated names and local modules but finds no evidence of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0.4, Confidence = 0.7.\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable. The obfuscation is noted but not deemed malicious.\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes the heavy obfuscation but finds no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0.7, Confidence = 0.8.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code's nature. The high obfuscation score reflects suspicion but not maliciousness.\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same conclusion—visualization functions, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0.7, Confidence = 0.8.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same as above, emphasizing the obfuscation but no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0.3, Confidence = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly lower obfuscation score, which is reasonable given the code's appearance.\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Similar conclusion—standard plotting functions, obfuscation present but no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0.8, Confidence = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Key points & recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature. No signs of malicious behavior are evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** High (around 0.7-0.8) due to the variable and import name obfuscation, which is justified.\n- **Security risk:** Low (0.2), as the code does not perform risky operations.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n- The **malware score** should remain at **0**, as there's no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- The **obfuscated score** should stay high (~0.7-0.8), reflecting the obscurity of variable and module names.\n- The **risk score** should be low (~0.2), consistent with the absence of active security threats.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.75 (average of reports)\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears to be a standard data visualization module with obfuscated naming, possibly to hinder analysis, but without malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and should not be adjusted significantly.",
