  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate bioinformatics CLI tool with superficial obfuscation and some incomplete snippets. No signs of malware, network activity, or malicious behavior are present. The obfuscation does not appear to hide malicious code but suggests caution due to code quality issues. The security risk is low, and the malware score is 0."
