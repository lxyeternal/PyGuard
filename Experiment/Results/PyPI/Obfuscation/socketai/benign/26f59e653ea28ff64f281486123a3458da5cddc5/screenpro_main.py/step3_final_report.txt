  "purpose": "CLI utility for processing guide RNA sequencing data, generating count matrices and count matrices files.",
  "sources": "Input files specified via command-line arguments, such as library files, FASTQ files, and sample identifiers.",
  "sinks": "Output files including reformatted library tables, count data per sample, and combined count matrix files.",
  "flows": "Reads input data from specified files/directories, processes data through bioinformatics pipelines, and writes results to output files.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variable and function names; some code snippets appear incomplete or malformed with undefined variables ('args', 'samples'); inconsistent string literals and argument options suggest superficial obfuscation or incomplete code.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a command-line interface for a bioinformatics pipeline, primarily for sgRNA counting. Obfuscated variable names are used but do not indicate malicious activity. The code processes input files, generates count data, and saves results. Some snippets are inconsistent or incomplete, which could cause runtime errors or suggest poor maintenance. No network activity, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are detected. The obfuscation appears superficial, possibly stylistic or autogenerated, but warrants caution. Overall, the code's behavior aligns with legitimate bioinformatics workflows, with no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate bioinformatics CLI tool with superficial obfuscation and some incomplete snippets. No signs of malware, network activity, or malicious behavior are present. The obfuscation does not appear to hide malicious code but suggests caution due to code quality issues. The security risk is low, and the malware score is 0.",
