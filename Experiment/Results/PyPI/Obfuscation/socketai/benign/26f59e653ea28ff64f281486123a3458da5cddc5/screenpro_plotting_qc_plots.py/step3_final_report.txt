  "purpose": "Data visualization and preprocessing routines for biological data, involving optional log transformation and plotting.",
  "sources": "Data extracted from input DataFrame slices, specifically columns specified by function parameters.",
  "sinks": "Plotting functions that generate scatter plots; no external data transmission or file I/O beyond visualization.",
  "flows": "Data is processed within the function, optionally log-transformed, then visualized; no external network or file flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names, unused utility import, placeholder functions, no explicit malicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data manipulation and visualization tasks using numpy and scanpy. Obfuscation is present but appears to serve code concealment rather than malicious intent. No network activity, file modifications, or suspicious payloads are evident. The utility import is unused, which could be a sign of incomplete or intentionally obscured code. Overall, the routines are benign, with obfuscation likely for IP protection or code concealment, not malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical data visualization routine with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malware, malicious payloads, or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation is notable but not indicative of malicious activity. The security risk is low, and the malware score should remain at 0. The obfuscation score is justified at approximately 0.75 due to nonsensical naming. Overall, the code appears benign and suitable for use with minimal concern.",
