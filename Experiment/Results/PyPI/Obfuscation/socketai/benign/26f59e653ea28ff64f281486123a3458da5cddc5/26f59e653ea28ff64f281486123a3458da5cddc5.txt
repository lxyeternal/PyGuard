      "conclusion": "The code is a standard bioinformatics data preprocessing pipeline with obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious activity, malware, or external threats. The high obfuscation score reflects variable name complexity but does not imply malicious intent. The malware score remains 0, and the security risk score is low (0.2). The undefined variable 'n_removed' indicates incomplete code but not malicious behavior."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is standard data processing code with a significant security consideration regarding pickle usage. If the pickle files or filenames are influenced by untrusted sources, this could lead to arbitrary code execution. No active malicious behavior or obfuscation is detected. The risk is primarily from unsafe pickle handling, which should be addressed by validating or avoiding untrusted pickle data. The overall malware score should be low (0), with a moderate security risk (~0.2-0.3) if filenames or pickle data are externally influenced."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate bioinformatics CLI tool with superficial obfuscation and some incomplete snippets. No signs of malware, network activity, or malicious behavior are present. The obfuscation does not appear to hide malicious code but suggests caution due to code quality issues. The security risk is low, and the malware score is 0."

      "obfuscated": 0.8,
      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The pattern of importing and executing an obfuscated symbol is suspicious and potentially malicious, warranting further investigation. Current scores are reasonable but should be adjusted to reflect higher suspicion, especially increasing malware and risk scores. The code's obfuscation and immediate execution pattern are red flags, though definitive maliciousness requires inspecting the actual implementation of the imported function."

The malware score is set to 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2). The obfuscation warrants caution, but based solely on this snippet, it does not constitute a security threat."

The high obfuscation warrants caution, but no evidence of malicious activity is present. Scores are appropriate; malware likelihood is minimal, and overall security risk is low. Continued scrutiny of the actual function code is advised to ensure safety."

      "conclusion": "The code is a typical data visualization routine with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malware, malicious payloads, or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation is notable but not indicative of malicious activity. The security risk is low, and the malware score should remain at 0. The obfuscation score is justified at approximately 0.75 due to nonsensical naming. Overall, the code appears benign and suitable for use with minimal concern."
