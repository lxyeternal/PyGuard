  "conclusion": "The code in the most suspicious package shows strong signs of obfuscation and dynamic code execution, warranting a high malware score (~0.75) and security risk (~0.8). Less suspicious or benign code is correctly scored as safe. The current scores are consistent with the analysis, and no adjustments are necessary."
