  "purpose": "Obfuscated Airflow DAG with anomaly detection tasks, using custom operators from a suspicious provider.",
  "sources": "Import statements, operator instantiations, and variable assignments, especially the custom operators and obfuscated function names.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network calls, file writes, or data exfiltration observed in the code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from DAG initialization through tasks (injection, anomaly detection, sensor, publisher) without external data inputs or outputs shown.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of function and variable names, import from a non-standard provider 'anomalo', use of custom operators with suspicious naming, lack of documentation or transparency.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a standard Airflow pipeline with tasks for data ingestion, anomaly detection, and publishing, but employs heavily obfuscated identifiers and imports from a non-standard provider. No direct malicious activity such as network communication, credential handling, or data exfiltration is evident. The obfuscation and custom operators raise suspicion but do not confirm malicious intent. The high obfuscation scores across reports are justified, but without concrete evidence of malicious behavior, the malware risk should be conservatively estimated. The overall structure appears consistent with legitimate data pipeline patterns, though the obfuscation warrants further review of the custom operators' implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation and uses custom operators from a suspicious provider, raising concerns about potential malicious intent. However, there is no direct evidence of malicious payloads or activities. The high obfuscation scores are justified, but the malware and security risk scores should be moderated in the absence of concrete malicious indicators. Further investigation into the custom operators' source code is recommended before making definitive security claims.",
