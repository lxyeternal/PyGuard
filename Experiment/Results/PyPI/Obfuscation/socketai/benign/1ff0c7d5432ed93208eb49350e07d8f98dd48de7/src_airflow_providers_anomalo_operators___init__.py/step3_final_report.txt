  "purpose": "Assess the supply chain security of the open source Python dependency by analyzing provided code snippets for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Input data, environment variables, external resource interactions, data processing functions",
  "sinks": "Network communication points, file operations, environment variable access, data output functions",
  "flows": "Input data received from sources, processed through functions, potentially reaching sinks such as network or file system",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected; code appears straightforward and benign",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate the code is benign, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious activity. Malware scores are consistently zero, and security risk scores are low (~0.2), reflecting a cautious but benign assessment. Confidence levels vary appropriately based on the amount of code or context provided. No evidence suggests sabotage or malicious intent. The reasoning in each report aligns with the scores assigned, and no inconsistencies are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly likely safe, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation detected. The low security risk scores are justified given the benign descriptions and lack of suspicious patterns. The assessments are consistent and appropriate.",
