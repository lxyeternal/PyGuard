  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static data used solely for configuration purposes.",
  "anomalies": "Function name appears nonsensical and obfuscated, which could suggest intent to hide purpose. No other suspicious behavior or hardcoded secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function with a non-descriptive name that returns static package metadata including package name, description, version, and connection type details. No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The function appears to serve as a static configuration or metadata provider, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscated behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static configuration function with a obfuscated name but no malicious intent or security issues detected. It simply provides package metadata for an Airflow provider plugin.",
