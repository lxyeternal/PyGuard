  "purpose": "Define a function that returns metadata about the 'apache-airflow-providers-anomalo' package, including its name, description, version, and connection type.",
  "sources": "The function does not read external input or data; it is a static function returning a hardcoded dictionary.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involved; no data is written to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "The function returns a static dictionary; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The function appears straightforward with no obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior. No external data fetching or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple function that returns static metadata about a specific Airflow provider package. There are no external inputs, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious code constructs. It appears to serve as a metadata descriptor without any malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static function returning package metadata with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
