{
  "purpose": "Define and return metadata for the 'apache-airflow-providers-anomalo' package, including its name, description, version, and connection types.",
  "sources": "The function itself, specifically the return statement providing package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data or external output are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input to vulnerable points; static data is returned directly.",
  "anomalies": "The function name appears obfuscated or nonsensical, which could be an attempt to evade detection. No other suspicious code behavior is present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function with a non-descriptive name that returns static metadata about a specific Airflow provider package. There are no external input sources, no data manipulation, and no execution of dynamic code. The primary concern is the obfuscated or unusual function name, which might indicate an attempt to hide malicious intent, but the payload itself is benign and simply provides package information.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely to return package metadata. The unusual function name warrants caution, but no malicious behavior or security issues are detected based on this snippet.",
