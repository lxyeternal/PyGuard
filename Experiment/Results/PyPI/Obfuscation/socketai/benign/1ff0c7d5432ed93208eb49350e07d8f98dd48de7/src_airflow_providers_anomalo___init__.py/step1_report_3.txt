{
  "purpose": "Returns metadata about the 'apache-airflow-providers-anomalo' package, including name, description, version, and connection types.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; static data within the function.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs that handle untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the function simply returns static data.",
  "anomalies": "Function name appears obfuscated or intentionally non-descriptive; no suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function with a nonsensical name that returns a static dictionary containing package metadata and connection type information. There are no external input reads, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious operations. The content appears to be a straightforward static metadata provider. The obfuscated function name could be a minor concern, but it doesn't indicate malicious intent. No indicators of malware, secret leaks, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple static data provider with an obfuscated function name. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this snippet.",
