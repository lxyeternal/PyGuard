{
  "purpose": "Provides static metadata about the 'apache-airflow-providers-anomalo' package, including name, description, versions, and connection types.",
  "sources": "The function returns hardcoded package information; no external inputs or data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code does not process or output data to external systems.",
  "flows": "Static data return; no data flow from sources to sinks involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "The function name appears obfuscated or nonsensical, which is unusual for such static metadata functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single, static function with an obfuscated name that returns package metadata. No external data, dynamic code, network activity, or secrets are present. The obfuscated name could be a red flag but does not indicate malicious behavior. The code is benign, serving as a static provider of package info. Malware score is 0; obfuscation score is around 0.4-0.7 due to the unusual name; security risk score is very low (~0.1). The overall behavior is non-malicious, with the only concern being the function name's obfuscation, which does not constitute malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static metadata provider with an obfuscated function name. There is no evidence of malware or malicious activity. The low security risk score and malware score are appropriate. The obfuscated name warrants mild suspicion but does not indicate malicious intent.",
