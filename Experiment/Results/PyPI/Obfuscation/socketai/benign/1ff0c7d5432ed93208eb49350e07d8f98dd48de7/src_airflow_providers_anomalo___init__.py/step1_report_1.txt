{
  "purpose": "Defines a function that returns metadata about the 'apache-airflow-providers-anomalo' package, including its name, description, versions, and connection types.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; the code is self-contained and static.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing of untrusted data present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the function merely returns static information.",
  "anomalies": "The function name 'QEHWkzWGvtwLCSbSbsmOlqmOjrQdubAI' appears obfuscated or randomly generated, which is unusual. The code does not perform any actions beyond returning static data.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function with a non-descriptive, seemingly obfuscated name. Inside the function, it returns a dictionary containing package metadata, including package name, description, versions, and connection type details. There are no input or output streams involving untrusted data, no code execution, network operations, or credential handling. The obfuscated function name may suggest an attempt to hide intent or reduce readability, but the function itself is benign. No suspicious behavior or malicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign static metadata provider with an unusually obfuscated function name. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks within this snippet.",
