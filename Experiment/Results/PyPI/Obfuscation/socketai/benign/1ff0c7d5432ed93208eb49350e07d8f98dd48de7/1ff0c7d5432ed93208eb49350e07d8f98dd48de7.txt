The high obfuscation score is justified but does not imply malicious intent. The malware score remains at 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.1-0.2)."

      "confidence": 0.7,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation and uses custom operators from a suspicious provider, raising concerns about potential malicious intent. However, there is no direct evidence of malicious payloads or activities. The high obfuscation scores are justified, but the malware and security risk scores should be moderated in the absence of concrete malicious indicators. Further investigation into the custom operators' source code is recommended before making definitive security claims."

      "obfuscated": 0.75,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "While the code does not currently exhibit explicit malicious activity, the heavy obfuscation and suspicious external hook names raise concerns. The scores have been adjusted to reflect moderate risk and obfuscation, emphasizing the need for further environment-specific review of external dependencies and runtime behavior. No definitive malware is detected, but caution is advised due to obfuscation tactics."

      "conclusion": "The code in the most suspicious package shows strong signs of obfuscation and dynamic code execution, warranting a high malware score (~0.75) and security risk (~0.8). Less suspicious or benign code is correctly scored as safe. The current scores are consistent with the analysis, and no adjustments are necessary."

      "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated external job status sensor with no current signs of malware or malicious activity. The high obfuscation warrants further investigation into the external class, but the supply chain risk appears low. The identified bug in exception handling is minor and non-malicious."
