  "conclusion": "While the code does not currently exhibit explicit malicious activity, the heavy obfuscation and suspicious external hook names raise concerns. The scores have been adjusted to reflect moderate risk and obfuscation, emphasizing the need for further environment-specific review of external dependencies and runtime behavior. No definitive malware is detected, but caution is advised due to obfuscation tactics."
