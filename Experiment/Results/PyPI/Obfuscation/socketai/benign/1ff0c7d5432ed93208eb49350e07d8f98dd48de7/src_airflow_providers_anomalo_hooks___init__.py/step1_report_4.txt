  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not provided or visible in the input.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables, function parameters, and possibly external modules or files (though not explicitly shown).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file operations, and system commands (if present), but none are explicitly visible.",
  "flows": "Without actual code, no source-to-sink data flows can be identified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are observable due to lack of code content.",
  "analysis": "The input contains no actual code to analyze; thus, no sources, sinks, or flows can be determined. No suspicious or malicious patterns are identifiable without code content. The review is limited by the absence of the code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of code, there are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The code appears benign or is missing from the provided input.",
