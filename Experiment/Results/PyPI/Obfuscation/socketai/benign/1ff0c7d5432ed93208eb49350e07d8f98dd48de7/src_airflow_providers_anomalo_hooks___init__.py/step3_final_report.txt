  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, subprocess calls, hardcoded commands, data inputs, external data sources.",
  "sinks": "System commands, environment variables, network communication, data printing, file operations.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or inputs flow into subprocess calls or data processing functions, potentially leading to system commands or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected; code appears straightforward and benign.",
  "analysis": "All provided reports describe code that is either simple, static, or lacks concrete suspicious patterns. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0) are consistent with the absence of malicious or obfuscated code. Risk scores are low (0.1-0.3), reflecting cautious but justified assessments. Confidence levels are appropriate given the limited or absent code snippets. No anomalies or indicators of malicious intent are present in the descriptions. Overall, the code snippets analyzed do not exhibit malicious behavior or obfuscation, and the security risks are minimal.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided descriptions and scoring, the code is benign with no evidence of malware or obfuscation. The risk levels are appropriately low, and the assessments are consistent and justified. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
