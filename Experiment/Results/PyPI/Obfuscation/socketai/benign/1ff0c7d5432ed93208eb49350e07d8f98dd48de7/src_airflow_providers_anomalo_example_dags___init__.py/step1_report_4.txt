  "purpose": "This source code appears to be a standard Python module or script, possibly performing data processing or utility functions. The purpose is not explicitly stated, but it does not show signs of malicious intent based on the visible code.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly shown in the code snippet provided. No obvious reading from external files, network, or environment variables is observed.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, network requests, or data output, but none are evident in the visible code. No insecure or suspicious data handling found.",
  "flows": "No clear source-to-sink data flows are identifiable due to lack of explicit input and output operations in the code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs are present. The code structure and variable usage appear standard. No obfuscated or unusual language features are detected.",
  "analysis": "A detailed review of the code shows standard programming patterns without signs of malicious activity. The code lacks network communication, data exfiltration, or system modification functions. No suspicious hardcoded secrets or dynamic execution constructs are identified. The code appears to be a normal, benign utility or module with no embedded malware or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It seems to be a safe, non-malicious script or module. The confidence level in this assessment is high, and there are no indications of obfuscation or malware.",
