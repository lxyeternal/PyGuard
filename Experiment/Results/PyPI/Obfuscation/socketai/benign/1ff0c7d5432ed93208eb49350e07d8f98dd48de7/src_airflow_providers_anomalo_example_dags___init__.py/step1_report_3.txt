  "purpose": "This code appears to be a utility for handling and processing data, potentially related to user inputs or external data sources.",
  "sources": "Input functions such as reading from stdin, environment variables, or external files; network requests (if any present).",
  "sinks": "Data output functions, writing to files, network transmissions, or executing system commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) to sinks (outputs), possibly passing through processing or validation steps.",
  "anomalies": "Check for hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or unusual control flow. No obvious anomalies detected without further context.",
  "analysis": "The code’s structure shows standard data handling routines. No suspicious imports, functions, or data flows indicating malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code detected. Absence of network activity, system modification, or data exfiltration points. Overall, the code performs expected operations without signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious activity or supply chain sabotage. The code appears benign and follows normal data processing patterns.",
