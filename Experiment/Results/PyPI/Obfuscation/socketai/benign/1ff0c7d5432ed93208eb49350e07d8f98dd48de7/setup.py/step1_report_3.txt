  "purpose": "Setup script for an Apache Airflow provider package for Anomalo.",
  "sources": "Reads package configuration data, dependencies, and entry points; imports 'setup' from setuptools.",
  "sinks": "No evident sink points that execute untrusted code or data.",
  "flows": "Imports 'setup' and passes package metadata to it; no flow from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names, which is unusual for standard setup scripts; no malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It includes obfuscated variable names, which could suggest an attempt to hide intent, but they only contain package metadata and configuration. The script imports 'setup' from setuptools and calls it with the package information, dependencies, and entry points. No code injection, network activity, or other malicious behavior is present. The use of obfuscated variables is suspicious but does not in itself indicate malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a typical package setup script with obfuscated variable names but no malicious intent or security risks identified. No malware or malicious behavior is evident.",
