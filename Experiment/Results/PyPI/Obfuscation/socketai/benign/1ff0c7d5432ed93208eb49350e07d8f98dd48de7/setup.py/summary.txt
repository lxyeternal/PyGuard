  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package setup configuration with obfuscated variable names but no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation is superficial and does not impact the benign nature of the script. Malware score is 0, obfuscation suspicion is moderate (around 0.7), and overall security risk is low (~0.2)."
