  "purpose": "A setup.py script configuring package metadata and dependencies for an Apache Airflow provider plugin.",
  "sources": "Static variables defining package info, dependencies, entry points, and package data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input or external data sources; configuration data used directly in setup().",
  "flows": "Static data assigned to variables and passed directly to setup(), no dynamic or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated or nonsensical variable names; incomplete 'long_description' field; no comments or descriptive naming.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names, which could be suspicious but does not execute any malicious code or perform runtime actions. No dynamic code, network activity, or external input handling is present. The obfuscation appears superficial, serving only to hide variable names, not malicious intent. The incomplete 'long_description' is likely a formatting or placeholder issue, not malicious. All indicators point to a benign configuration script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package setup configuration with obfuscated variable names but no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation is superficial and does not impact the benign nature of the script. Malware score is 0, obfuscation suspicion is moderate (around 0.7), and overall security risk is low (~0.2).",
