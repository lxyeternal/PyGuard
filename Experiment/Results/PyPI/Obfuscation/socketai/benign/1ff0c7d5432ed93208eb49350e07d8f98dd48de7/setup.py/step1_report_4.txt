  "purpose": "Setup script for an Apache Airflow provider package related to Anomalo.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata, dependencies, and entry point definitions from variables; no external data input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or user input; primarily static configuration data.",
  "flows": "Definition of package metadata flows into setup() call, configuring package installation.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of variable names with seemingly random strings; no suspicious code execution or dynamic code. Long description appears incomplete (truncated or malformed), which could be a formatting issue but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily constructs parameters for setuptools.setup(), defining package metadata, dependencies, package data, and entry points. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or file manipulation observed. Variable names are obfuscated but do not influence runtime behavior. The setup process appears standard for Python packaging, with no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical package setup script with obfuscated variable names but no malicious behavior detected. The code serves to configure and install an Airflow provider package, with no evident security risks or malware.",
