  "purpose": "Generate a version string compliant with PEP 386 based on a predefined tuple.",
  "sources": "The tuple mWfzKsNEkjEGnInQEEWZtcssEiAwLOYR, which provides version components.",
  "sinks": "The return statement constructs and outputs a version string; no external data or untrusted input used.",
  "flows": "Tuple values are validated, then parts are joined to form a version string; no external data flows into or out of the code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code, and no apparent obfuscation. The code performs standard version string assembly.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a tuple representing version components. The function validates the tuple length and the release stage. It determines the version components to include based on the tuple, then assembles and returns a version string. No inputs from external sources, no data leaks, and no malicious code patterns are present. The logic appears to be standard version formatting logic without any hidden or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward version string generator based on a predefined tuple, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It does not involve external data, network activity, or potential attack vectors.",
