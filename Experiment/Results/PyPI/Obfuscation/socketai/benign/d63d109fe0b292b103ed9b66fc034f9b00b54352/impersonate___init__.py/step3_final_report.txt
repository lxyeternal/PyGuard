  "purpose": "Generate a PEP 386-compliant version string from a hardcoded tuple representing version components.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded tuple 'mWfzKsNEkjEGnInQEEWZtcssEiAwLOYR' with version parts.",
  "sinks": "String join operations to assemble the version string; assertions for validation.",
  "flows": "Tuple elements flow through assertions and string concatenation to produce the version string.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; no external input or network activity; superficial obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a version string based on a predefined tuple, validating its structure with assertions. Variable names are obfuscated, but the logic is straightforward, involving string joining and conditional suffix addition for pre-releases. No external data, network calls, or malicious payloads are present. The obfuscation appears superficial, likely stylistic or for code concealment, but does not indicate malicious intent. The code is a benign utility for version formatting.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, obfuscated version string generator with no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation is superficial and does not elevate risk. It poses no supply chain threat and can be considered safe.",
