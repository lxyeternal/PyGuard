{
  "purpose": "Standard Django AppConfig subclass with obfuscated class and attribute names, importing signals module within a method.",
  "sources": "The method cDOUorLZIxUGtKRtKPJbfOXVvphQATsN imports the local signals module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, external network calls, or data exfiltration points are present.",
  "flows": "The import of signals occurs within the method, which is typical for connecting signal handlers in Django.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and attribute names; static string attributes with no apparent purpose; import inside a method.",
  "analysis": "The code is obfuscated but follows a common Django pattern for connecting signals, with no malicious code, network activity, or data leakage evident. The obfuscation appears superficial, likely to hide intent but not malicious. The import pattern is standard practice. No suspicious behavior or vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports reflect the superficial obfuscation and low risk, which are appropriate given the evidence.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django AppConfig with superficial obfuscation and no malicious activity detected. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware and risk scores should remain low. No immediate security concerns are identified from this snippet.",
