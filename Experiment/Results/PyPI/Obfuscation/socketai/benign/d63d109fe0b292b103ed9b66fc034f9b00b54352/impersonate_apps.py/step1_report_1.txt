  "purpose": "Define a Django application configuration class that imports signals.",
  "sources": "Import statement within the method cDOUorLZIxUGtKRtKPJbfOXVvphQATsN.",
  "sinks": "The import statement potentially loads signals which may contain additional code.",
  "flows": "When cDOUorLZIxUGtKRtKPJbfOXVvphQATsN is called, it imports the signals module, executing its code.",
  "anomalies": "Class name and attribute names are obfuscated with nonsensical identifiers; no clear purpose from the code itself.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an AppConfig subclass with obfuscated class name and attributes. It contains a method that imports a local signals module, which is a common pattern in Django apps to connect signal handlers. The obfuscated identifiers could be an attempt to hide the true intent, but no malicious code or suspicious behavior is directly visible here. The import is conditional, but since the method is not called in this snippet, it's unclear when signals are imported. No hardcoded credentials, external network calls, or other malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Django app configuration with obfuscated names, likely to hinder readability. There is no evident malicious behavior or security risk within this snippet itself, although obfuscation could be used to hide malicious code in other parts. The overall risk is low.",
