  "purpose": "Django application configuration class for a project or app.",
  "sources": "Module import from . (signals).",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks or data flows leading to security issues.",
  "flows": "Import of signals module, which may register signal handlers.",
  "anomalies": "Class and variable names are obfuscated, using random strings. No actual logic or secret data. The code is minimal and does not perform any suspicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django AppConfig subclass with obfuscated class and variable names. It sets two class variables with string values, which appear to be arbitrary. The only executable statement is the import of the signals module within the setup method, which is common in Django apps. The obfuscation suggests an attempt to hide the code's purpose, but there are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. No input sources or dangerous sinks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Django app configuration with obfuscated names. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
