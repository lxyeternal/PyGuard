{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Django model for tracking user impersonation sessions, including start and end times, and calculating the duration of impersonation.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the Django settings (AUTH_USER_MODEL), and database fields for impersonation records.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data; no network or file operations, no external data output.",
  "flows": "Model data flows from database fields to the duration calculation method, which returns a string representation of the impersonation duration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names; no hardcoded secrets or credentials; no suspicious imports or code patterns. The code appears standard for Django models, with no unusual code execution, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code models impersonation sessions with start and end timestamps, providing a property to calculate the duration of impersonation. The implementation is straightforward, leveraging Django ORM features and the 'duration_string' utility. The variable names are obfuscated but follow Django conventions. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The code structure and logic are consistent with standard Django modeling practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate Django model for tracking user impersonation sessions without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It does not contain obfuscation that suggests malicious hiding, nor does it perform any insecure operations. Overall, it is a benign piece of application code.",
