Obfuscation is significant but not necessarily malicious. Overall, the security risk is moderate, with no evidence of sabotage or malicious payloads."

      "conclusion": "The code review indicates that while some reports show signs of obfuscation and risky patterns, there is no concrete evidence of malicious payloads. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and no significant adjustments are necessary. The overall security posture is moderate, warranting cautious monitoring but not outright rejection of the dependency."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, comprehensive test suite for impersonation and session management in Django. There is no evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or supply chain sabotage. The scores reflect the controlled testing environment: malware score 0, obfuscated score approximately 0.2, and security risk around 0.2. Overall, the code is safe and aligns with standard testing practices."

The security risk is moderate, primarily due to potential misuse of impersonation if access controls are lax. Malware score remains at 0, as no malicious code or behavior is evident."
