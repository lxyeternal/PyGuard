  "conclusion": "The code implements typical impersonation and search functionalities with obfuscation but no malicious activity detected. The high obfuscation score is justified. The security risk is moderate, primarily due to potential misuse of impersonation if access controls are lax. Malware score remains at 0, as no malicious code or behavior is evident."
