  "obfuscated": 0.4,

  "conclusion": "The code review indicates that while some reports show signs of obfuscation and risky patterns, there is no concrete evidence of malicious payloads. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and no significant adjustments are necessary. The overall security posture is moderate, warranting cautious monitoring but not outright rejection of the dependency."
