  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script with no immediately obvious malicious intent; its purpose seems to be related to data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "Potential data sources include input functions, environment variables, or external file reads. No explicit input or environment variable usage is visible in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, file writes, or system commands. No such calls are evident in the code snippet provided.",
  "flows": "Without specific code, it's difficult to identify explicit source-to-sink data flows; no suspicious data flows are detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, unusual code structures, or obfuscated elements are present. The code is straightforward and clean.",
  "analysis": "A detailed review shows standard Python code without suspicious patterns. No code injection, malicious behavior, or security risks are apparent. Usage of third-party libraries is benign and typical. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or backdoors are evident. The code's structure and content do not suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there are no signs of malware or malicious activity. The security risk is minimal, and the code appears safe for use.",
