  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script defining package metadata, dependencies, and entry point.",
  "sources": "Static strings defining package name, version, dependencies, entry point, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no dynamic code execution or data processing.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "Package name 'acvrdkra1xsw2y11' appears unusual or obfuscated but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py configuration with static data, no dynamic or malicious constructs. The entry point references an external module, but the setup script itself does not execute or include malicious code. The package name's randomness could be suspicious but is not evidence of malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this script. The primary concern is the content of the 'p1radup.p1radup:main' function, which is outside the scope of this script. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscated at 0.2 due to the package name, and security risk at approximately 0.1-0.2, reflecting low risk based on static analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign and standard; no malicious activity or obfuscation detected within it. The main risk depends on the implementation of the 'main' function in the 'p1radup' module, which is not provided. The current scores are appropriate, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0 and a low security risk score (~0.1-0.2). Vigilance is recommended when inspecting the actual module code.",
