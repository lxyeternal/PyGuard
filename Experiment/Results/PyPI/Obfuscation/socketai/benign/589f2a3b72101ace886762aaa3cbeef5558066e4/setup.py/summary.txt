  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign and standard; no malicious activity or obfuscation detected within it. The main risk depends on the implementation of the 'main' function in the 'p1radup' module, which is not provided. The current scores are appropriate, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0 and a low security risk score (~0.1-0.2). Vigilance is recommended when inspecting the actual module code."
