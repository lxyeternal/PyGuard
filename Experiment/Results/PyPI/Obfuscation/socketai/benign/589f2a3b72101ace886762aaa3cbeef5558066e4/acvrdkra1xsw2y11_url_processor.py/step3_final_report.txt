{
  "purpose": "The code manages URLs: adding URLs, parsing components, handling query parameters, and reconstructing URLs with modifications.",
  "sources": "Input URLs added via methods, query parameters parsed from URL components, external validation function `kPFqrYedNMGvgTLsjkEvhYdDZcuuKORw` used for URL validation.",
  "sinks": "URL reconstruction with `urlunparse`, print statements for errors, potential external function calls.",
  "flows": "Input URLs → parsing components → query parameter processing → URL modification → URL validation → reconstructed URL output.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with nonsensical class/method/variable names, use of undefined variables like `parsed_url`, reliance on external validation function without implementation, inconsistent variable naming, and incomplete code snippets.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be focused on URL management, including adding URLs, parsing query parameters, and reconstructing URLs with modified parameters. Obfuscation and external dependencies are prominent, raising suspicion but not directly indicating malicious intent. The presence of undefined variables and incomplete code suggests either obfuscation or poorly maintained code. No network activity, payloads, or explicit malicious actions are evident. The external validation function's purpose cannot be assessed, but its use indicates an attempt at URL validation. Overall, the code's structure and behavior do not demonstrate malicious behavior but warrant caution due to obfuscation and incomplete implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily URL processing logic with high obfuscation but no evidence of malicious payloads or active malicious behavior. The low malware score aligns with the analysis. The high obfuscation score reflects the code's obscured nature, which could conceal malicious intent if combined with malicious inputs or external functions. The moderate security risk score accounts for potential misuse due to obfuscation and incomplete code, but no direct malicious activity is detected.",
