{
  "purpose": "Input validation for control characters and URL correctness, with obfuscated function names.",
  "sources": "Input text parameter in validation functions, references to 'new_url' in print statements.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data leaks or system modifications detected.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through control character check and URL validation functions; no external data or system calls observed.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated names, references to undefined variable 'new_url', inconsistent naming conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code performs benign validation tasks—checking for control characters and URL validity. The obfuscation and undefined 'new_url' suggest incomplete or intentionally concealed code. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious system modifications are present. The obfuscation indicates suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. The undefined variable could be exploited if manipulated externally but appears more like incomplete code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily benign validation logic with signs of obfuscation and incomplete implementation. No direct malicious activity is evident, but the obfuscation and undefined variables warrant cautious review. The malware score is set to 0.2, reflecting moderate suspicion; obfuscation is high (~0.8), and overall security risk is moderate (~0.3). Further investigation is recommended if integrated into larger systems.",
