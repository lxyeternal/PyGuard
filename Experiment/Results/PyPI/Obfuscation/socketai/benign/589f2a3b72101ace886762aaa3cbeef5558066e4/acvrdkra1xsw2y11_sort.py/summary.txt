  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate large-file sorting utility but contains a critical security vulnerability due to unsafe eval() usage. It does not exhibit malware or malicious payloads. The main risk stems from potential code injection if user inputs are malicious. The malware score remains at 0, but the security risk score should be high (~0.75). Obfuscation is moderate. To mitigate risks, eval() should be replaced with safer alternatives, and inputs should be validated."
