      "confidence": 1,
      "conclusion": "The setup script is benign and standard; no malicious activity or obfuscation detected within it. The main risk depends on the implementation of the 'main' function in the 'p1radup' module, which is not provided. The current scores are appropriate, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0 and a low security risk score (~0.1-0.2). Vigilance is recommended when inspecting the actual module code."

      "obfuscated": 0.8,
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate large-file sorting utility but contains a critical security vulnerability due to unsafe eval() usage. It does not exhibit malware or malicious payloads. The main risk stems from potential code injection if user inputs are malicious. The malware score remains at 0, but the security risk score should be high (~0.75). Obfuscation is moderate. To mitigate risks, eval() should be replaced with safer alternatives, and inputs should be validated."

      "security_risk": 0.2,
      "obfuscated": 0.75,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a URL normalization and deduplication tool with significant obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The obfuscation and inconsistent error handling are concerns but do not indicate malware. Overall, the security risk is low, but caution is advised due to obfuscation and code quality issues."

      "obfuscated": 0.8,
      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code is primarily benign validation logic with signs of obfuscation and incomplete implementation. No direct malicious activity is evident, but the obfuscation and undefined variables warrant cautious review. The malware score is set to 0.2, reflecting moderate suspicion; obfuscation is high (~0.8), and overall security risk is moderate (~0.3). Further investigation is recommended if integrated into larger systems."

      "conclusion": "The code is primarily URL processing logic with high obfuscation but no evidence of malicious payloads or active malicious behavior. The low malware score aligns with the analysis. The high obfuscation score reflects the code's obscured nature, which could conceal malicious intent if combined with malicious inputs or external functions. The moderate security risk score accounts for potential misuse due to obfuscation and incomplete code, but no direct malicious activity is detected."
