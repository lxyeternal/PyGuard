  "purpose": "The code appears to perform data processing or manipulation, but without additional context or comments, the exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from variables, function inputs, or possibly external files (if present), but no specific source is explicitly visible.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include print statements, network calls, or data storage functions if present, but no explicit sinks are identified due to lack of code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) through processing functions and potentially to outputs or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious functions, or unusual code constructs are apparent. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal or incomplete, limiting in-depth analysis. No malicious behaviors or security risks are evident from the provided snippet. Absence of external network calls, backdoors, or sensitive data handling suggests low suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or significant security risks. The code appears benign, but limited context constrains full assessment.",
