  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and anomalies based on provided code snippets or summaries.",
  "sources": "Data read from environment variables, inputs, or external sources; potential network or file operations.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, or other system interactions where untrusted data could cause leaks or harm.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs/env vars) to sinks (network/file operations), potentially via intermediate processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious API calls detected; limited code context.",
  "analysis": "Code reviews across reports indicate no malicious or obfuscated code, with scores consistently low or zero. Confidence varies based on available information, with higher confidence when code snippets are provided. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors identified. The low security risk scores are justified given the benign nature and lack of evidence. The scores are internally consistent and reflect the limited data scope.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency appears benign with no evidence of malicious or obfuscated code. Security risks are minimal, and the scoring aligns with the available information. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.2,
