  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated security/session management component with no direct evidence of malicious activity. The high obfuscation score reflects its obscurity, but the malware suspicion remains low. The overall security risk is moderate, primarily due to obfuscation and complexity, which could conceal malicious intent if present. Continued monitoring and deeper static/dynamic analysis are recommended."
