  "purpose": "The code provides password utility classes for generation and validation, implementing password policies with configurable parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads input passwords for validation, generates passwords using character sets and random choices.",
  "sinks": "No external data sources or sinks; validation raises exceptions, but no data leaks or network activity are present.",
  "flows": "Password input flows into validation functions; generated passwords are constructed from character sets and randomness.",
  "anomalies": "Uses weak randomness seeded with time, trivial passwords, no obfuscation or malicious code; no suspicious backdoors or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines password utility classes with validation and generation routines. It employs standard libraries and straightforward logic. The primary security concern is the use of time-based seed for randomness, leading to predictable passwords, and the generation of trivial passwords, which could weaken security. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The validation raises exceptions on policy violations, but no external data leaks or network activity are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate password utility with poor security practices (weak entropy and trivial passwords) but no malicious intent or payloads. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or sabotage, only suboptimal security practices. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.2, reflecting the weak randomness but no malicious activity.",
