{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define custom exception classes related to password validation, internationalization, and account security management within a password utility component.",
  "sources": "The code reads static string messages, class initializers, and exception parameters; no external input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data or external systems are present; no data leaks, network calls, or file operations are detected.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code mainly defines classes and messages, with no dynamic data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class names and variable names (e.g., 'UkjNpHayNLlCOaPvfHPCRgewJNvxDBYR') is unusual but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, network connections, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists primarily of custom exception classes with localized message handling for password validation errors, such as length, similarity, character composition, and reuse checks. No external input handling, network communication, or file operations are present. The use of translation functions suggests internationalization support. The presence of obfuscated names may hinder readability but does not imply malicious intent. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious code segments are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of password validation exception classes, primarily for use within a password policy framework. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, security breaches, or supply chain attacks in this code segment.",
