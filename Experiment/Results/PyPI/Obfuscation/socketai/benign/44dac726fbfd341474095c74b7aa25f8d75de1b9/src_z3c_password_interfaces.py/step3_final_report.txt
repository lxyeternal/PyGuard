  "purpose": "Defines validation error classes and password policy exceptions, with internationalization support.",
  "sources": "Standard imports from zope modules and message factory; class initializations with message keys/data.",
  "sinks": "Exception instantiations with localized messages, possibly involving user-controlled data.",
  "flows": "Creation of exception objects with message keys/data, exception instances initialized with principal or config data.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and class names; heavy string obfuscation; inconsistent comments; no dynamic code or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of exception classes for password validation, with localized messages. Obfuscation appears stylistic or for concealment, not malicious. No signs of malicious activity, network activity, or data leaks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate password validation framework with obfuscation that seems stylistic or proprietary. No malicious behavior or supply chain threats are detected.",
