  "conclusion": "Most reports indicate benign code with appropriate low scores. One report shows potential dynamic code execution, warranting moderate suspicion and higher scores. Missing code reports are justified with zero risk. The overall assessment suggests low to moderate risk, with scores reflecting suspicion where patterns like eval/exec are suspected but not confirmed. Adjustments should be made if concrete evidence of malicious functions is found."
