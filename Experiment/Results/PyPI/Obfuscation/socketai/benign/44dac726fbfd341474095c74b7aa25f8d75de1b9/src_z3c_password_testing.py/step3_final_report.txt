  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code patterns, suspicious functions, and anomalies.",
  "sources": "Potential input points include dynamic code execution functions (eval, exec), network calls, environment variable reads, file operations, and data handling points.",
  "sinks": "Data exfiltration points, network connections, system modifications, or sensitive data access points where untrusted data could cause harm or leaks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as input functions or environment variables to sinks like network sockets, file writes, or system commands, potentially via dynamic code execution or obfuscated code.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of dynamic code execution (eval/exec), obfuscated variable names, suspicious imports, lack of validation, or missing code sections. Absence of code itself can be suspicious if expected.",
  "analysis": "The code review involves identifying source points like input functions or environment reads, tracing data flows to sinks such as network or file operations, and detecting anomalies like eval/exec or obfuscation. The reports indicate that benign code shows no suspicious patterns, with low malware and obfuscation scores, and low security risks. Suspicious reports mention dynamic code execution and ambiguous data flows, justifying moderate scores. Missing code in some reports limits assessment, but scores are adjusted accordingly. Overall, the reasoning aligns with the evidence, with suspicion levels calibrated to the presence of dynamic or obfuscated patterns.",
  "conclusion": "Most reports indicate benign code with appropriate low scores. One report shows potential dynamic code execution, warranting moderate suspicion and higher scores. Missing code reports are justified with zero risk. The overall assessment suggests low to moderate risk, with scores reflecting suspicion where patterns like eval/exec are suspected but not confirmed. Adjustments should be made if concrete evidence of malicious functions is found.",
