  "purpose": "Setup for documentation testing using unittest and doctest modules with obfuscated function and variable names.",
  "sources": "Static file references ('README.txt', 'principal.txt') and imported testing modules; no untrusted input or external data flows.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no external data exfiltration, network activity, or malicious sinks.",
  "flows": "Static file reads to test suite setup; no dynamic or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated function and variable names; no malicious code or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a test suite for documentation files with specific doctest options, using standard libraries and a testing module. No external data, network activity, or code injection is present. Obfuscated naming is noted but not indicative of malicious intent. The code's purpose is benign, serving as a test setup. Scores assigned in reports (malware: 0, risk: 0.1, obfuscation: moderate) are consistent with the analysis. No evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities is found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign documentation test setup with obfuscated names. No malicious behavior or security risks are present. The scores are appropriate; malware score remains 0, obfuscation is moderate, and overall risk is minimal.",
