  "purpose": "Standard setup script for a Python package, defining metadata, dependencies, and configuration.",
  "sources": "The 'read' function (unused), the parameters passed to 'setup()' including the obfuscated variable and embedded secret string.",
  "sinks": "None; no runtime data flow or external data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No active data flows; static assignment of parameters, with potential obfuscated or secret data embedded in setup arguments.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a nonsensical variable name 'wiLXsRozDiCoSIPupkpKcHJAQzNdKzmq' assigned a string that appears to be a secret, and another obfuscated parameter 'diDLrAJhYsXJkNweaCsbMHsBVImdqEtp=True'. The variable name and secret are unusual in a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py with no malicious code execution. The suspicious elements are the embedded secret 'a5fsifsz45ot2xwy' assigned to a non-standard parameter, and the obfuscated variable names. These suggest obfuscation or secret hiding but do not indicate active malicious behavior. The embedded secret poses a security concern if exposed. The variable names and parameters are likely attempts at obfuscation or concealment. No network activity, code injection, or malicious logic is present. The low malware scores across reports are justified; the obfuscation and embedded secrets increase the security risk slightly. Overall, the code appears benign but warrants caution regarding secret management and obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard package setup with suspicious obfuscated variables and embedded secrets. No active malware or malicious behavior is detected, but the embedded secret and obfuscation suggest potential security concerns. Proper secret handling and review of obfuscation are recommended.",
