  "conclusion": "Most code is benign, but Report 4 shows signs of obfuscation and suspicious behavior warranting higher malware and risk scores. Dynamic features like eval/exec elevate the potential threat, though no confirmed malicious payloads are present. Scores should be adjusted accordingly to reflect these findings."
