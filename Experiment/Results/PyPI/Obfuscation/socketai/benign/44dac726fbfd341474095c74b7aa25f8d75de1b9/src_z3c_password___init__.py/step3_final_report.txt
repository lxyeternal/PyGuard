  "purpose": "Analysis of Python code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks, focusing on dynamic features like eval/exec, hardcoded secrets, and suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Input data sources such as environment variables, user inputs, external files, or network interfaces.",
  "sinks": "Potential data exfiltration points, network connections, file modifications, or system calls that could lead to security breaches.",
  "flows": "Data flow paths from sources through code execution or data processing to sinks, especially involving untrusted inputs and dynamic execution functions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, suspicious patterns, or unusual control flow structures.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits varying levels of suspicion. Reports 2 and 3 show benign patterns with no obfuscation or malicious indicators. Report 1 uses eval/exec but lacks evidence of malicious payloads; the risk is moderate. Report 4 displays significant obfuscation and dynamic execution, indicating higher suspicion; scores should reflect this. Report 5 lacks code for assessment. Adjustments: Increase malware score for Report 4 from 0.4 to 0.6 to better represent suspicion; keep others as is. Overall, scores align with the evidence, with the primary concern in Report 4 due to obfuscation and dynamic features.",
  "conclusion": "Most code is benign, but Report 4 shows signs of obfuscation and suspicious behavior warranting higher malware and risk scores. Dynamic features like eval/exec elevate the potential threat, though no confirmed malicious payloads are present. Scores should be adjusted accordingly to reflect these findings.",
