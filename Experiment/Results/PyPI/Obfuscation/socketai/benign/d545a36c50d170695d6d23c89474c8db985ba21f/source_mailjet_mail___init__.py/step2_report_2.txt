  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the evidence, scores, and logical consistency.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports agree that the code is minimal, importing a symbol with an obfuscated or nonsensical name from a local module.\n- No direct malicious activity (network, file, or system calls) is present in the code snippets.\n- The primary concern is the obfuscated import name, which could suggest hiding malicious intent or simply obfuscation for legitimate reasons.\n- The malware scores are low (mostly 0.2 or 0), which aligns with the absence of evident malicious actions.\n- The obfuscated scores are high (~0.7), reflecting suspicion about the naming.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issue presence:** The code matches the reported snippets exactly; the import statement and `__all__` are consistent.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No syntactic or logical errors are apparent in the code snippets themselves.\n- **Scores review:**\n  - Malware scores are low, which is reasonable given the lack of direct malicious activity.\n  - Obfuscated scores are high, which is justified due to the nonsensical import name.\n  - Security risk scores are moderate (~0.2-0.3), aligning with the suspicion but not evidence of active threats.\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- The suspicion hinges on the obfuscated symbol name. While obfuscation can be used maliciously, it is also common in auto-generated code or for legitimate reasons.\n- The reports correctly state that no malicious behavior is evident in this snippet.\n- The risk scores for malware should remain low unless further context reveals malicious actions.\n- The obfuscated scores are appropriate, but if the imported symbol is benign, the obfuscation alone shouldn't elevate the malware score.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Scores adjustment:** Since there's no evidence of malware or malicious activity, the malware score should be **0.0**.\n- **Obfuscated score:** remains high (~0.7), reflecting suspicion.\n- **Risk score:** should be low (~0.2-0.3), consistent with the current assessments.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0.0** (no evidence of malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0.7** (obfuscated name, potential for concealment)\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** (low, primarily due to obfuscation, but no active threat)\n\n**In conclusion,** the code appears benign in isolation, with obfuscation being the main concern. Further review of the source module and overall package context is necessary to determine if the obfuscation is justified or malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is minimal and matches the reports.\n- No malicious activity is demonstrated.\n- Obfuscation is suspicious but not conclusive.\n- Scores should reflect zero malware risk, high obfuscation suspicion, and low overall risk.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.7\n- **Risk:** 0.2",
