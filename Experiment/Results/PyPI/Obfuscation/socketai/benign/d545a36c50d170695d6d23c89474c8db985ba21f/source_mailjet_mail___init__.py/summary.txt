  "conclusion": "The code is minimal and does not demonstrate malicious behavior directly. The obfuscated import name is suspicious and warrants further review of the source module. Current scores are appropriate: low malware risk, high suspicion due to obfuscation, and low overall risk. Additional investigation of the imported symbol's implementation is recommended to rule out malicious intent."
