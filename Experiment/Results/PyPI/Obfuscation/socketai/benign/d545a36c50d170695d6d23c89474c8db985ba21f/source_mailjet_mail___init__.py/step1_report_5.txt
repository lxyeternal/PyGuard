{
  "purpose": "Define module exports with a specific source import and expose 'SourceMailjetMail' class or object",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module './source'",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present in this snippet; no untrusted data handling or network calls observed",
  "flows": "Import from './source' potentially loads code or data, but no flow from untrusted sources to sinks in this snippet",
  "anomalies": "The imported identifier 'xhALTiWmRYzLtqKBwHECqpBouxlTmIRk' appears as a random string, possibly obfuscated or autogenerated; no other anomalies detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports a symbol with a seemingly random or obfuscated name from a relative source module. It then explicitly exposes 'SourceMailjetMail' via __all__. The import's name does not follow conventional naming schemes, which could suggest obfuscation or code generation. There are no apparent malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors within this snippet. The code appears to be a typical module export setup, but the obscured import name warrants attention for potential obfuscation or malicious intent in a larger context.",
  "conclusion": "This code is minimal and mainly serves as a module export interface. The use of a seemingly obfuscated import name raises some suspicion, but no malicious behavior or security risks are evident in this isolated snippet. Further review of the 'source' module would be necessary for a definitive assessment.",
