{
  "purpose": "The code imports a specific object from a relative module and defines an export list for the module.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module file 'source' for the import statement.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the import is static and appears to be part of normal module setup.",
  "anomalies": "The imported object has an obfuscated or nonsensical name 'xhALTiWmRYzLtqKBwHECqpBouxlTmIRk', which could be an attempt to hide malicious intent or obfuscate functionality. The code is minimal and does not include any other logic or checks.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple import of a potentially obfuscated object from a relative module. The presence of a nonsensical name may indicate obfuscation or an attempt to hide malicious code. However, without additional context or code, it appears to be standard module setup with an unusual identifier. There are no apparent malicious actions, data leaks, or security issues in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal and contains an import statement with a suspiciously obfuscated name. It does not exhibit clear malicious behavior, but the obfuscated name warrants caution. Overall, the risk is low based on this snippet alone, but further review of the source module is recommended.",
