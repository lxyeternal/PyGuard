  "purpose": "Minimal import of an obfuscated symbol from a local module, likely part of a package's initialization.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .source module importing xhALTiWmRYzLtqKBwHECqpBouxlTmIRk",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing, network, or system calls observed",
  "flows": "Import source -> usage of imported symbol (not shown in snippet)",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated symbol name, which could be used to hide malicious intent",
  "analysis": "The code imports a symbol with a nonsensical, obfuscated name from a local module and defines an export list. No malicious behavior or malicious code execution is evident in this snippet. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. Malware scores are low (around 0.2), reflecting suspicion but no active threat. Obfuscation scores are high (~0.7), indicating suspicion. Risk scores are low (~0.2-0.3), consistent with the lack of evidence of malicious activity. The code appears benign but warrants further inspection of the source module to determine the purpose of the obfuscated symbol.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal and does not demonstrate malicious behavior directly. The obfuscated import name is suspicious and warrants further review of the source module. Current scores are appropriate: low malware risk, high suspicion due to obfuscation, and low overall risk. Additional investigation of the imported symbol's implementation is recommended to rule out malicious intent.",
