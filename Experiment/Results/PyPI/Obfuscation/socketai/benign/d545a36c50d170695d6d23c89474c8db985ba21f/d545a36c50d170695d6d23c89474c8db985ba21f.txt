      "conclusion": "The code is obfuscated and potentially conceals malicious behavior, but no direct malicious activity is evident. The main concern is the obfuscation, which warrants further review of the imported module. The current assessment indicates low to moderate malware and security risk, primarily due to obfuscation, with no confirmed malicious activity."

      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code is minimal and does not demonstrate malicious behavior directly. The obfuscated import name is suspicious and warrants further review of the source module. Current scores are appropriate: low malware risk, high suspicion due to obfuscation, and low overall risk. Additional investigation of the imported symbol's implementation is recommended to rule out malicious intent."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign subclass configuration with an obfuscated class name. No active malicious or security-threatening behavior is detected. The high obfuscation score indicates suspicion but not malicious intent. Overall, the code appears safe, with the obfuscated name being the only concern for further review."
