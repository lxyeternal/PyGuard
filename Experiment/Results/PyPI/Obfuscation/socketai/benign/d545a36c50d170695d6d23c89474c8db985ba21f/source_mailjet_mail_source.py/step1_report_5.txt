  "purpose": "Define a subclass of YamlDeclarativeSource with a specific YAML path configuration.",
  "sources": "Import statement for YamlDeclarativeSource; instantiation of class which sets 'path_to_yaml'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks identified.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of the class with preset configuration; no external data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual class name 'xhALTiWmRYzLtqKBwHECqpBouxlTmIRk' appears obfuscated or randomly generated, which could be suspicious. No other anomalies present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a known library. Defines a subclass with a non-descriptive, possibly obfuscated name. The constructor calls the superclass constructor, passing a static dictionary with 'path_to_yaml' set to 'manifest.yaml'. No dynamic code, external inputs, or malicious patterns detected. The obfuscated class name might be an attempt to hide intent, but it alone does not indicate malicious behavior. Overall, the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward subclass definition with a non-descriptive name. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscated class name may warrant further review, but based on this fragment alone, it appears safe.",
