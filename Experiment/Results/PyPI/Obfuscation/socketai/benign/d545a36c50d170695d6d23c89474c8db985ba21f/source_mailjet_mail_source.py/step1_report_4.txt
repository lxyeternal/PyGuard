  "purpose": "Define a subclass of YamlDeclarativeSource that loads configuration from 'manifest.yaml'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from airbyte_cdk.sources.declarative.yaml_declarative_source and class initialization with a YAML path.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; no untrusted data handling or output functions.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the class is a simple subclass without data processing flow.",
  "anomalies": "Class name 'xhALTiWmRYzLtqKBwHECqpBouxlTmIRk' appears obfuscated or randomly generated, which is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a known library component and defines a subclass that loads a YAML configuration file. The class name looks intentionally obfuscated, which can be a tactic to hide malicious intent or evade detection. However, the constructor only passes a static filename to the parent class, with no additional logic or network activity. There are no hardcoded credentials, no code injection, and no suspicious operations. The obfuscated class name raises suspicion, but the core logic itself appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself is straightforward and does not contain active malicious behavior. The only concern is the obfuscated class name, which might be used to hide malicious purposes, but based solely on this snippet, it appears benign.",
