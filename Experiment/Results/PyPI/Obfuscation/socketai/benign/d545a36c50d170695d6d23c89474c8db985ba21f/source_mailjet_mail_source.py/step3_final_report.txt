  "purpose": "Defines a subclass of YamlDeclarativeSource with a fixed YAML file path.",
  "sources": "Static import of YAML path during class initialization.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, network activity, or data leakage observed.",
  "flows": "Static data flow from class instantiation to YAML configuration usage.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class name 'xhALTiWmRYzLtqKBwHECqpBouxlTmIRk'.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a known class, defines a subclass with a fixed YAML path, and does not perform any dynamic or network operations. The only irregularity is the obfuscated class name, which could be an attempt to conceal purpose but does not execute malicious actions. Malware score is 0, indicating no malicious activity. Obfuscation score is high (~0.7), reflecting suspicion but not malicious intent. Security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), consistent with benign code. The class's simplicity and lack of active malicious behavior suggest it is safe, though the obfuscated name warrants cautious review in broader context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign subclass configuration with an obfuscated class name. No active malicious or security-threatening behavior is detected. The high obfuscation score indicates suspicion but not malicious intent. Overall, the code appears safe, with the obfuscated name being the only concern for further review.",
