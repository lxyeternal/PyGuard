  "conclusion": "The code is obfuscated and potentially conceals malicious behavior, but no direct malicious activity is evident. The main concern is the obfuscation, which warrants further review of the imported module. The current assessment indicates low to moderate malware and security risk, primarily due to obfuscation, with no confirmed malicious activity."
