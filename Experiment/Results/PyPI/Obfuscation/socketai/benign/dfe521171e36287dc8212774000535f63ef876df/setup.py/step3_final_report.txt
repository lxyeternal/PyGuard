  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script using setuptools to configure package metadata, dependencies, and URLs.",
  "sources": "Reads current directory path and 'README.md' content.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution present.",
  "flows": "Reads file content and passes metadata to setup(), with no external data flow or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, but no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with obfuscated variable names, which appear to be stylistic rather than malicious. It performs standard package configuration without dynamic execution, network activity, or handling untrusted data. Multiple reviews agree on its benign nature, noting the obfuscation as cosmetic. No evidence of malware, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities is present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, risk: ~0.1, obfuscation: moderate) are consistent with the code's structure and content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with obfuscated variable names. There is no malware, malicious intent, or security risk. The obfuscation appears cosmetic and does not impact security.",
