  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'yef0go6fox2oq39v', primarily for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'README.md' file for long description content.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data flows to critical functions or outputs.",
  "flows": "Reads 'README.md' content into setup parameters; no other data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The variable names are obfuscated (e.g., MaGNZNqNcfmNWUKuUYxjqKdmXrnNQRYf), which is unusual but not malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools, reads the README file, and invokes setup() with typical package metadata, dependencies, and URLs. Variable obfuscation appears to be a coding style choice rather than malicious intent. The dependencies and URLs are standard and point to legitimate repositories. No suspicious network activity, code injection, or malicious behavior is evident. The code appears to be a normal package setup script with obfuscated variable names, which might hinder readability but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard Python package setup script with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation seems stylistic rather than malicious.",
