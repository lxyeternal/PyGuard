      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate testing suite for API endpoints, with no evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. The minor obfuscation and use of random signatures are standard in test environments. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscated score at 0.2, and security risk at 0.2, reflecting a low-risk, non-malicious testing context."

      "conclusion": "The code is primarily boilerplate with obfuscated identifiers. No active malicious behavior is detected in this fragment. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. The overall security risk is low, but further review of the imported modules is recommended to rule out hidden malicious code."

      "conclusion": "The code is a complex, obfuscated utility for serializing and logging HTTP request and response data. Despite the obfuscation, there is no evidence of malicious activity or malware. The high obfuscation level warrants caution but does not indicate malicious intent. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score should remain at 0."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, if heavily obfuscated, HTTP request utility with retry and logging features. No evidence of malware, malicious data exfiltration, or sabotage is present. The obfuscation may serve to conceal proprietary or security reasons but does not imply malicious activity. The overall security risk is low, with a malware score of 0 and an obfuscation score around 0.8. Continuous review of the full codebase and external dependencies is recommended to ensure no hidden malicious payloads."
