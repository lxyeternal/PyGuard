  "sources": "No data input, user input, or external data sources present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, output, or external communications present.",
  "flows": "No data flows are observable in this code.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of two custom exception classes with obfuscated, nonsensical names; no actual logic or functionality.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two class definitions for exceptions, both with highly obfuscated names. There are no functions, data handling, or external interactions. The classes inherit from Python's built-in Exception class, which is standard for custom errors. The obfuscated class names and lack of other code suggest potential obfuscation, but no malicious activity or malicious intent is evident from these class definitions alone. There are no suspicious operations, data leaks, or malicious behaviors visible.",
  "conclusion": "This code only defines two custom exception classes with obfuscated names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks based solely on this fragment. It appears to be harmless or part of a larger obfuscated codebase.",
