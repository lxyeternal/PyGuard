  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling or specific exception management.",
  "sources": "No data input, no external data sources, only class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks, no data processing, no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows; only class inheritance structure.",
  "anomalies": "Class names are nonsensical and obfuscated, with no meaningful identifiers or documentation; no actual code logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes with obfuscated names, inheriting from each other. There are no functions, data handling, or operations performed. The obfuscated class names could be an attempt to hide intent, but with no behavior or data, they do not exhibit malicious activity. Lack of code logic, data sources, or sinks suggests benign purpose or incomplete code. No suspicious patterns like hardcoded credentials, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code only defines two custom exception classes with obfuscated names, without any operational or malicious content. It appears benign and may be part of a larger, incomplete codebase. There is no evidence of malware or security risks based on this snippet.",
