{
  "purpose": "Defines two custom exception classes, likely for use in a larger application or module.",
  "sources": "No data input sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths evident.",
  "anomalies": "Classes are named with obfuscated, nonsensical identifiers, which may be used to evade detection or hide intent. The classes do not contain any methods or logic, making them appear as placeholders or obfuscation techniques.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two custom exception class definitions with obfuscated names. There is no logic, data handling, or external interaction. The obfuscated class names could be an attempt to hide malicious intent or simply placeholder code. Without additional context or implementation, no malicious behavior or security issues are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code only defines obfuscated exception classes without any operational logic. Based on the provided snippet, there is no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. The obfuscated naming could suggest an attempt at concealment, but no malicious behavior is demonstrated.",
