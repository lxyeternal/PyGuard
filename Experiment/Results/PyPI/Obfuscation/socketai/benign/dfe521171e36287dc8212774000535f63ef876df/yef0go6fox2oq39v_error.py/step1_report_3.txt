{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for potential use in a larger application.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines classes and does not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks due to absence of input handling or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The class names are obfuscated and nonsensical, with no apparent meaningful logic or context.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two class definitions inheriting from Exception, with highly obfuscated and nonsensical class names. There is no functional code, no data processing, no input/output, and no suspicious behaviors or code flows. The obfuscated class names could be an attempt to hide intent, but without additional context, they do not indicate malicious behavior. The code is minimal and does not include any external library usage or complex logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be just obfuscated exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security risks evident. The obfuscation may be suspicious but could also be a form of simple name mangling; based solely on this snippet, there is no indication of malware or security threats.",
