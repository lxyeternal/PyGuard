{
  "purpose": "Define two custom exception classes with obfuscated names, likely placeholders or stylistic obfuscation.",
  "sources": "Class definitions with hardcoded class names; no input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only class inheritance declarations without logic or data transfer.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated, nonsensical class names; no methods or data; minimal code structure.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two class definitions inheriting from Exception, with obfuscated names. No functions, data handling, or external interactions are present. The obfuscation suggests placeholder or stylistic naming but does not indicate malicious behavior. Malware score is 0, consistent with no malicious activity. Obfuscation score is high (~0.8), reflecting the nonsensical class names. Security risk score is very low (~0.1), as there are no security issues or vulnerabilities evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, merely obfuscated exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security risks. The high obfuscation score is justified, but overall, the code poses minimal threat. No further action required.",
