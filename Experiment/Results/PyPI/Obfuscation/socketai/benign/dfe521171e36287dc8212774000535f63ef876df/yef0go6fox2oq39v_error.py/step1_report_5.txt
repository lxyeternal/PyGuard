  "purpose": "Define two custom exception classes, one inheriting from the other.",
  "sources": "None; no input reading or external data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "None; no data or untrusted input is processed or outputted.",
  "flows": "No data flow; classes are only definitions without runtime behavior.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated-like class names, but no malicious or suspicious code behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code simply defines two custom exception classes with obfuscated names. There are no methods, data processing, or external interactions. The class inheritance is straightforward, and no suspicious patterns, such as data exfiltration or malicious code, are visible.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be purely for obfuscation or stylistic purposes, defining custom exceptions without any malicious intent or security risks.",
