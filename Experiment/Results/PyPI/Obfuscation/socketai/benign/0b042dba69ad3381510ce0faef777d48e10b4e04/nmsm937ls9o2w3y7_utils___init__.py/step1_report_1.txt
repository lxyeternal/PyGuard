  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly clear due to lack of comments or descriptive variable names. It appears to be intended for data processing or utility functions, but this cannot be confirmed definitively.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input functions, environment variables, or imported modules, depending on the specific code sections. Without actual code, the main potential sources are user inputs, environment variables, or external libraries.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls (such as requests or socket operations), file writing/reading, subprocess execution, or data serialization/deserialization. Specific sinks cannot be identified without code, but these are typical in such scripts.",
  "flows": "The source-to-sink flow likely involves reading data from user input or environment variables, processing or transforming this data, and then sending it to external systems, files, or network sockets.",
  "anomalies": "No specific anomalies can be identified without actual code content. The absence of comments, obscure variable names, or unusual code patterns would typically be suspicious if present. Currently, no such patterns are observed.",
  "analysis": "Since no actual code snippet is provided, a detailed analysis cannot be performed. Normally, one would look for hardcoded secrets, suspicious network addresses, obfuscated code, or malicious function calls. The current placeholder provides only a structural overview, not a detailed code review.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the lack of specific code content, no malicious behavior can be confirmed or ruled out. The code appears benign, but without actual code, this cannot be definitively established. Further detailed review of the actual code is needed.",
