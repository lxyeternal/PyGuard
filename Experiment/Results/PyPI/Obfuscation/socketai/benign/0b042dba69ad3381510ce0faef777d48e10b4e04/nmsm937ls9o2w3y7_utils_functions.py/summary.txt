  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard facial analysis tool with obfuscation and dynamic external dependencies. There is no concrete evidence of malicious behavior. The primary concerns are the obfuscation and external downloads, which could be exploited if sources are malicious or compromised. Overall, the security risk is moderate, and malware likelihood is low but slightly elevated due to obfuscation and network activity."
