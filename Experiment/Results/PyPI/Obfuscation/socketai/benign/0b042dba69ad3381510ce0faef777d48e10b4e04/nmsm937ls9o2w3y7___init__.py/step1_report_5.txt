  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script or module, possibly intended for general functionality, but no explicit purpose can be determined from the provided snippet.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly visible; typical sources might include user input, environment variables, or external files, but none are evident here.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are not clearly identified; typical sinks include network connections, file writes, or system commands, none of which are explicitly present in the provided code.",
  "flows": "No clear data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks is observable in the provided code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hard-coded secrets, or obfuscated code are evident in this code snippet. The code structure appears normal.",
  "analysis": "The code provided is minimal or absent, with no visible input handling, data processing, or external interactions. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration. The overall structure and content are typical of benign Python scripts. Due to the lack of detailed code, confidence in any potential malicious intent is low, and no security risks are apparent from this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign and does not exhibit anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
