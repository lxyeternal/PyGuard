  "purpose": "Assess the security posture of the open source dependency based on provided code snippets and reports.",
  "sources": "Code snippets, import statements, data processing functions, or absence of code.",
  "sinks": "External data sources, network connections, or data leaks, if present.",
  "flows": "Input sources to processing functions to output or external connections.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, suspicious imports, or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate benign, minimal, or absent code with no suspicious patterns. Malware scores are consistently 0, obfuscation scores are 0, and security risks are very low (~0.1-0.2). Confidence levels are appropriate given the limited or benign code descriptions. No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities is found across the reports. The scores are internally consistent and justified by the provided summaries.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency appears safe with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The current scoring (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) is appropriate and should be maintained. No further revisions are necessary.",
