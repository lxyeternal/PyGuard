  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform data processing or utility functions within a larger application. There are no obvious indications of malicious activity based on the provided code snippet.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from local variables, function parameters, and possibly environment variables or imported modules, but no external untrusted input sources are explicitly identified.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include output functions such as print statements, file writes, or network communications if present, but none are explicitly shown in the snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions to output sinks; however, the code appears straightforward without complex or suspicious data flow patterns.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual constructs are observed. The code does not contain obfuscation, malicious system calls, or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "A careful step-by-step review indicates that the code performs standard operations without any signs of malicious behavior. No suspicious data leaks, malicious commands, or security misconfigurations are evident. The code structure is clear and typical for Python utility scripts.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indicators of malicious activity, malware, or security risks. The code appears benign, with no anomalies suggesting malicious intent.",
