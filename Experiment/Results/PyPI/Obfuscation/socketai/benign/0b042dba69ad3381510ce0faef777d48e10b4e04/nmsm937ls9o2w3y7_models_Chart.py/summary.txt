  "conclusion": "The code is a standard model loader with obfuscation and external dependencies. No evidence of malicious activity or malware is detected. The primary concern is supply chain risk due to downloading weights from an external URL without validation. Obfuscation adds moderate suspicion but is not conclusive of malicious intent. The overall security risk is low to moderate, and malware likelihood is negligible."
