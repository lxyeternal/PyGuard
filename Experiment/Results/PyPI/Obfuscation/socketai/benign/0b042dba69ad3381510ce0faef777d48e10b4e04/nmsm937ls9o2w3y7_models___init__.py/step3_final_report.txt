  "purpose": "Assess the security posture of the open source dependency based on provided code analysis reports, focusing on malicious behavior, obfuscation, and overall risk.",
  "sources": "Not applicable; no code snippets provided in the reports.",
  "sinks": "Not applicable; no untrusted data flows identified due to absence of code.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; analysis limited to report summaries without concrete code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; reports indicate no suspicious activity, obfuscation, or malicious indicators.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious code, with malware and obfuscated scores set to 0. Risk scores are low, reflecting minimal concern, with minor adjustments suggested for reports 3 and 4 to better align with the lack of concrete code evidence. Confidence levels are high where thorough review was indicated, and appropriately lower where no code was available. Overall, the assessments are consistent and justified based on the information provided.",
  "conclusion": "The reports are accurate and consistent; no malicious activity or obfuscation detected. Minor risk score adjustments for reports 3 and 4 are recommended to reflect the absence of concrete code evidence. Overall, the dependency appears benign with very low security risk.",
