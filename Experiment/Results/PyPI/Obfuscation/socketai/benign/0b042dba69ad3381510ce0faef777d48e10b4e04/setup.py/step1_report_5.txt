{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package aimed at image data analysis and feature extraction.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for description; importing packages such as tensorflow, deepface, yolov5, PyMuPDF, dlib, mediapipe.",
  "sinks": "No obvious sinks for untrusted data or network communication. No use of eval, exec, or insecure functions found.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; mainly static package setup with dependencies listed.",
  "anomalies": "The variable names are obfuscated and nonsensical, which may suggest attempts to hide intent or obfuscate code logic. No actual malicious code is evident in this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and reads a README file for description. The setup() call specifies package metadata and dependencies. The dependencies include popular libraries for image and facial data analysis. The obfuscated variable names are unusual but do not indicate malicious intent by themselves. No network activity, code execution, or data leaks are present. The code appears to be a standard package setup with obfuscated variable names.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a package setup script with obfuscated variable names but contains no evident malicious behavior or security risks. It is a typical setup configuration for a research-focused Python package.",
