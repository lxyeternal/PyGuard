  "purpose": "This setup.py script configures the packaging of a Python project related to image data analysis, specifying metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md for long description; defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md -> setup() call with metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; no malicious code or network activity; dependencies are typical.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names, which is unusual but not malicious. No malicious payloads, network activity, or security vulnerabilities are present. Dependency list is typical for research image analysis packages. The obfuscation may be stylistic or for concealment but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard packaging tasks. Obfuscation is the only unusual aspect but does not imply malicious behavior. No evidence of malware or security risks is found.",
