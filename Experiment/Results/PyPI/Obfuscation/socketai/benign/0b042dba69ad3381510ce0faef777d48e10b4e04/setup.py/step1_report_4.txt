{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package related to image data analysis, feature extraction, and object detection.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'README.md' file for long description; dependencies are specified in setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks or data leaks are evident; no network or system command execution present.",
  "flows": "The script reads the README file (source) and uses setup parameters to define package info (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names with random strings and inconsistent naming conventions suggest potential obfuscation. No malicious code or hardcoded secrets are apparent. No suspicious network activity or backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup tasks using setuptools, reading the README.md file for description, and specifying dependencies. Variable names are obfuscated but appear as random strings, which could indicate obfuscation but do not contain malicious logic. No code injection, network calls, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The dependencies include standard ML and image processing libraries, with version specifications that are typical for such projects. Overall, the code appears as a typical setup script with obfuscated variable names but no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard Python package setup file with obfuscated variable names but no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The obfuscation may be accidental or stylistic and does not impact security.",
