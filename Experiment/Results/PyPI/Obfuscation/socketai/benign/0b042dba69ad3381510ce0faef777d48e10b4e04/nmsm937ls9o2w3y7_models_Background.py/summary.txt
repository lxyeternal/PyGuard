  "conclusion": "The code is a standard model loading routine with obfuscated variable names. No evidence of malicious activity or backdoors. The main concern is obfuscation and reliance on external URL for weights, which is common in ML workflows but should be validated in security-critical environments. The malware score remains at 0, with moderate obfuscation and low security risk."
