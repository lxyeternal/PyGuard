The primary concerns are the obfuscation and external downloads, which could be exploited if sources are malicious or compromised. Overall, the security risk is moderate, and malware likelihood is low but slightly elevated due to obfuscation and network activity."

No significant revisions are necessary; the scores are consistent with the evidence and reasoning provided."

The main concern is obfuscation and reliance on external URL for weights, which is common in ML workflows but should be validated in security-critical environments. The malware score remains at 0, with moderate obfuscation and low security risk."

It does not contain malicious code but has a moderate security concern due to the external weight download without validation. The obfuscation and reliance on external sources warrant caution, but no active malicious behavior is present."

The primary concern is supply chain risk due to downloading weights from an external URL without validation. Obfuscation adds moderate suspicion but is not conclusive of malicious intent. The overall security risk is low to moderate, and malware likelihood is negligible."
