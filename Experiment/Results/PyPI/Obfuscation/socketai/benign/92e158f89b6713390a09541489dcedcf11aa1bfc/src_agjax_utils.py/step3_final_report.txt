  "purpose": "Utility functions for data validation, splitting, and conversion in scientific and machine learning workflows, leveraging numpy, jax, and autograd.",
  "sources": "Function parameters and internal data structures; no external data sources or network calls.",
  "sinks": "Data transformations within functions; no external or untrusted data outputs or network activity.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through validation, splitting, and mapping functions, ultimately converting data structures to arrays.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names, but no malicious or suspicious code behavior detected. Functions perform standard validation and data handling tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions for data validation, splitting, and conversion, with a class registered as a JAX pytree node. No network activity, file I/O, or system modifications are present. Obfuscation appears to be for namespace management rather than malicious intent. Validation functions check index bounds and duplicates, which are standard safety measures. No signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration are evident. The malware score is justified as 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2), consistent with benign utility code. The high obfuscation does not imply malicious intent but warrants cautious review, which confirms benign behavior in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of legitimate utility functions for data handling in scientific or ML workflows. Despite obfuscation, there is no evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The overall assessment indicates a safe, utility-focused module.",
