  "conclusion": "The code is a complex, obfuscated testing framework for mathematical differentiation functions, with no evidence of malicious activity or security threats. The high obfuscation is likely for testing edge cases or confidentiality, not malicious purposes. The malware score should remain at 0, and the security risk low (~0.2)."
