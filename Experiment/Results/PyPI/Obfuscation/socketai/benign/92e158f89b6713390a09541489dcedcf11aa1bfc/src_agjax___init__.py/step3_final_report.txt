{
  "purpose": "Define package version and author information, and import modules from 'agjax' with obfuscated variable names.",
  "sources": "Static string assignments for version and author; import statements from trusted modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data flows; no sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Static data assignments and imports; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names that do not serve a clear purpose; no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling; minimal structure beyond metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code is static, consisting of hardcoded strings and straightforward imports. Variable names are obfuscated but do not perform any suspicious or malicious operations. There are no signs of dynamic behavior, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads. The obfuscation appears to be a pattern to conceal simplicity rather than an indicator of malicious intent. The malware score is appropriately set to 0, and the obfuscation score is justified given the variable naming. Security risk is minimal due to the static and benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as package metadata with obfuscated variable names. No malicious activity or security threats are evident. The current scoring is appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
