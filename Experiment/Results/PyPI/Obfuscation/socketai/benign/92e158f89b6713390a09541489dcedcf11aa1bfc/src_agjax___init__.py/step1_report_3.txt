{
  "purpose": "Define package version and author info, and import specific modules from the 'agjax' library for experimental features and wrappers.",
  "sources": "Constant string assignments for version and author; import statements from 'agjax' library",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks or malicious actions",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; imports are static",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated-looking variable names; no explicit secrets or malicious code, but naming may suggest obfuscation or concealment",
  "analysis": "The code assigns string values to variables with non-descriptive, seemingly obfuscated names, indicating possible concealment. It imports modules from 'agjax', a legitimate-looking library, and defines an '__all__' list for module exports. There are no dynamic executions, no hardcoded credentials, no network connections, or malicious activities. The presence of obfuscated variable names could be suspicious, but it does not necessarily imply malicious intent. The code is minimal, straightforward, and appears to serve as a module setup or configuration with no apparent malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple, defining version info, author, and importing modules. No malicious activity or malicious code patterns are present. The obfuscated variable names are suspicious but not evidence of malicious intent. Overall, the code appears benign.",
