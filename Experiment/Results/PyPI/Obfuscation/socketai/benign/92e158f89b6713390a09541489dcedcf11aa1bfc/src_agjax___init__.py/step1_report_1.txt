  "sinks": [
    "Variables 'eAkBNmVcqrXnuVMHCxgxZsgbzICMYfks' and 'cvTVtAEknyQkuuxmOKpznhDjUnUaDQOb' are assigned static strings; no untrusted data involved.",

    "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; all data is hardcoded or static.",
    "Import statements bring in predefined modules without executing untrusted code or executing dynamic data flows."

  "anomalies": [
    "Variable names are intentionally obfuscated or randomly generated, which is unusual but not inherently malicious.",
    "No usage of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution seen.",
    "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or sensitive data detected.",
    "The code appears to be a typical package setup snippet with obfuscated variable names."
  ],
  "analysis": "The code defines version and author information with obfuscated variable names, then imports specific components from the 'agjax' package. The import statements are static, and no untrusted input or dynamic execution is present. The variable names are unusual but not suspicious. There are no signs of malicious activity, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code's structure indicates it is a simple package metadata and import setup, with obfuscated identifiers likely for code obfuscation or anti-tampering purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign package setup snippet with obfuscated variable names. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code does not perform any suspicious actions or contain malicious payloads.",
