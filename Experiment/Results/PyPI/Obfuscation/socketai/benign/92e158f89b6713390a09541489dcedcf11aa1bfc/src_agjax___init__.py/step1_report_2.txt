  "purpose": "Define package version and author information, and expose specific modules for external use.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string assignments for version and author info; import statements from 'agjax' package.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data; no functions or operations that handle external input or data outputs.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow identified; code mainly sets metadata and imports modules.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names (eAkBNmVcqrXnuVMHCxgxZsgbzICMYfks, cvTVtAEknyQkuuxmOKpznhDjUnUaDQOb, NxhNuLCQRkxoKhhwxgcRqWATsuScQamG); minimal code functionality, no comments, or documentation; potential obfuscation pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns static strings to variables with obfuscated names, possibly to conceal their purpose. It exports a list of symbols and imports modules from a package 'agjax'. There are no dynamic operations, no input handling, or data processing. The use of non-descriptive variable names suggests obfuscation but does not necessarily indicate malicious intent. There are no suspicious network operations, credential handling, or code execution routines. Overall, the code appears to be a simple module metadata setup with obfuscated variable names, which could be a pattern to avoid easy detection but does not inherently contain malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily setting package metadata and importing modules with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, suspicious data flows, or security risks. The obfuscation may be intentional to hide simplicity or for minor obfuscation purposes, but no malicious intent is apparent.",
