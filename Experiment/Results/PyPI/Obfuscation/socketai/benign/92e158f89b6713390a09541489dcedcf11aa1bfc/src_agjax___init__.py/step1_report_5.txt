{
  "purpose": "Defines version information, author contact, and exports certain modules for a Python package.",
  "sources": "Constants assigned to obfuscated variable names, import statements from third-party library.",
  "sinks": "Import statement potentially loading external modules; no direct sink for untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No clear data flow from untrusted source to sink. Constants are static; imports are static.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names; no explanation or context for the variables or imports.",
  "analysis": "The code sets two string variables with obfuscated names, likely for version and author info, which appear benign. The __all__ variable exposes specific modules or functions. The import statements are standard; however, variable names are unusual and obfuscated, which could be a sign of hiding intent or simply obfuscation. No data input, network activity, or other malicious behavior is evident. The code's purpose seems to be defining package metadata and exposing specific components.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, with obfuscated variable names that do not indicate malicious behavior. No malicious intent or suspicious activity is detected based on this snippet. The code appears to be benign package metadata and import statements.",
