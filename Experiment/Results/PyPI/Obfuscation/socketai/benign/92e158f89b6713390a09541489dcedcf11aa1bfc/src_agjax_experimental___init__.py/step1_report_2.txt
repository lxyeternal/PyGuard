  "purpose": "Import a specific class or function 'NxhNuLCQRkxoKhhwxgcRqWATsuScQamG' from a module within 'agjax.experimental.wrapper' and expose it via '__all__'.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing from 'agjax.experimental.wrapper'. No other data input or external source reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or potential data leaks detected in the code.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows present; the code only performs an import and defines __all__.",
  "anomalies": "The class/function name 'NxhNuLCQRkxoKhhwxgcRqWATsuScQamG' appears to be a nonsensical or obfuscated identifier, which could suggest obfuscation or malicious intent. The package 'agjax' is not widely known, and the use of an obscure name raises suspicion.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a possibly obfuscated or intentionally unreadable symbol from a module within 'agjax.experimental.wrapper' and sets __all__ for exports. The import statement alone does not perform malicious actions. However, the unusual name for the imported symbol indicates potential obfuscation or malicious intent, especially if the package source or context is suspicious. No other code is present that could indicate malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "While the code itself is minimal and does not perform any harmful actions, the use of an obscure symbol name suggests obfuscation, which could be intended to hide malicious functionality. Without additional context, the risk level is moderate due to the suspicious naming but no direct evidence of malicious behavior in this snippet.",
