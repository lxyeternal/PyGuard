The high obfuscation score is justified, but without additional context or code, the likelihood of malware or significant security risk remains low. Continued monitoring and further code analysis are recommended to confirm or dismiss potential malicious behavior."

No active malicious behavior or malware is evident. The scores are appropriate; however, input sanitization is recommended to mitigate potential path traversal or injection vulnerabilities."

The security risk is low but non-negligible if inputs are untrusted. Scores assigned in previous reports are appropriate; minor adjustments could be made to reflect the obfuscation level and input validation concerns."
