  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code, reasoning, and scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard Sphinx extension setup, importing modules, version check, logging, configuration, event connection, directive and node registration. No suspicious activity or data leaks are observed.\n- **Scores:** malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior. The obfuscation is minimal and not suspicious. The risk score is low, justified by the absence of vulnerabilities.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the obfuscated variable names. The analysis notes that obfuscation could be suspicious but appears to be just code concealment, not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware 0, obfuscated 0.6, risk 0.2\n- **Assessment:** The higher obfuscation score is justified given the variable names. No malware or malicious activity detected. The reasoning aligns with the code's behavior.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard Sphinx extension setup, with obfuscated variable names but no malicious intent. The confidence is slightly lower due to obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware 0, obfuscated 0.7, risk 0\n- **Assessment:** The high obfuscation score is justified. No malware or security issues are evident.\n- **Verdict:** Scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a typical extension setup, no suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, high confidence.\n- **Scores:** malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent. No issues detected.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, standard registration of directives and nodes, with obfuscation but no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware 0, obfuscated 0.2, risk 0.2\n- **Assessment:** Slight obfuscation, justified. No malware or vulnerabilities.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusions:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code or activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Varies from 0 to 0.7, reflecting the variable naming style. The highest obfuscation scores are justified given the variable names.\n- **Risk Score:** Mostly low, consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n**Malware:** 0 — no signs of malware or malicious activity detected.\n\n**Obfuscated:** 0.6 — the variable names are intentionally obscure, which warrants a moderate obfuscation score.\n\n**Risk:** 0.2 — standard extension setup with minimal risk.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent with the code, and their scoring aligns with the observed behavior.
