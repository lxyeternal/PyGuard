  "sources": "__import__('pkg_resources')",
  "sinks": "declare_namespace(__name__)",
  "flows": "__import__('pkg_resources') -> declare_namespace(__name__)",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import (__import__) to load a module; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious data handling observed",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports the 'pkg_resources' module, then calls 'declare_namespace' with '__name__' to designate the current package as a namespace package. This is a common pattern in Python package management and does not involve any suspicious behavior. No untrusted data input, data leakage, or malicious code execution is evident. The code is minimal and adheres to standard namespace declaration practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard namespace declaration for a Python package using pkg_resources. It does not exhibit any malicious or suspicious behavior. The code is typical for managing namespace packages and poses no security threat.",
