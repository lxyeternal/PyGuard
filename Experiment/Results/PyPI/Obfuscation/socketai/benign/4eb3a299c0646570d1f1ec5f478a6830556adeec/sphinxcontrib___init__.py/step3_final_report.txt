  "purpose": "Declare a namespace package using pkg_resources' declare_namespace method.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' dynamically via __import__ and passes __name__ to declare_namespace.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows are present; the code only performs a namespace declaration.",
  "flows": "Import of 'pkg_resources' -> call to declare_namespace(__name__) with no external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __import__ with a string argument is dynamic but common; no malicious or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard pattern for defining namespace packages in Python. It uses dynamic import, which is typical in such contexts. There are no inputs, outputs, or data flows that could lead to security issues. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious intent. The use of declare_namespace is a common practice in packaging. No signs of backdoors, data leaks, or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign namespace declaration pattern with no security risks or malicious activity. All reports correctly identify its purpose and safety. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is appropriately low (~0.1). The overall assessment confirms the code's safety and standard usage.",
