  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Issue presence:** The code is a straightforward namespace declaration with no data handling or untrusted input.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 — reasonable given the minimal code.  \n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior, only namespace declaration. The low security risk score is appropriate.  \n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same as above, standard namespace declaration.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.  \n- **Justification:** No suspicious activity.  \n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same pattern, no untrusted data.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — consistent with the code.  \n- **Justification:** Standard namespace declaration, no security concerns.  \n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Issue presence:** Again, a typical namespace declaration.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** Use of string argument in __import__, which is dynamic but common and safe here.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 — slightly higher risk score, but still reasonable given the minimal, safe code.  \n- **Justification:** No malicious intent, just dynamic import. The low risk score is justified.  \n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same pattern, no data leaks or malicious behavior.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** Use of __import__ with string, which is uncommon but not malicious.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 — acceptable.  \n- **Justification:** No evidence of malicious activity, just namespace setup.  \n\n---\n\n### Summary of my assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, as expected. The code does not perform any malicious actions.  \n- **Obfuscated scores:** All zero, as the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.  \n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports due to dynamic import usage, but these are standard patterns in Python packaging and not risky.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent with the code and its intent.  \n- No changes needed; the code is safe and standard for namespace declaration.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and minimal.  \n- **Risk:** 0.05 — very low, given the nature of the code, but I accept the small risk due to dynamic import patterns.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign namespace declaration, with no security risks or malware. The current scores are appropriate, and I agree with the assessments provided.",
