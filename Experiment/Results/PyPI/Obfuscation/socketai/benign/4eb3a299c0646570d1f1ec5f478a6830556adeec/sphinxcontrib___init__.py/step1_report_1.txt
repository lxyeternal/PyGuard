  "purpose": "Declare the current package as a namespace package using pkg_resources.",
  "sources": "__import__('pkg_resources').declare_namespace(__name__)",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating untrusted data handling or potential data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code solely declares namespace.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; code is a straightforward namespace declaration, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkg_resources' module dynamically and calls 'declare_namespace' with __name__, which designates the package as a namespace package. This is a common technique for creating namespace packages, especially in plugin systems or modular packages. No suspicious behavior, malicious code, or malicious intent is evident. No external inputs or sensitive data handling are present. The code is minimal and standard in structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace declaration using pkg_resources and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
