  "purpose": "Declare the current namespace as a pkg_resources namespace package.",
  "sources": "__import__('pkg_resources').declare_namespace(__name__)",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; the code sets up namespace declaration but does not handle external untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only declares namespace support.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; the code uses a string argument in import(), which is generally safe but may be considered dynamic import behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports the 'pkg_resources' module and calls 'declare_namespace' on the current module's name (__name__). This pattern is typical for setting up namespace packages in Python and does not involve processing user input or untrusted data. There are no embedded secrets, network activity, or other suspicious behaviors. The code is minimal and straightforward, primarily related to package setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard pattern for namespace package declaration in Python and does not exhibit malicious behavior. It is likely part of a package's __init__.py to support namespace sharing. No security issues or malware are present.",
