  "flows": "Import 'pkg_resources' -> call 'declare_namespace' with '__name__'",
  "anomalies": "Uses __import__ with a string, which is uncommon but not inherently malicious; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' via dynamic import and declares the current package as a namespace package. This is a standard pattern for creating namespace packages that can span multiple distributions. There are no visible signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks. The use of __import__ with a string is a dynamic import, but it is a common practice in some packages for flexibility. No external data sources, untrusted inputs, or sinks are present. No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace declaration using pkg_resources with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It is safe and commonly used in Python packaging.",
