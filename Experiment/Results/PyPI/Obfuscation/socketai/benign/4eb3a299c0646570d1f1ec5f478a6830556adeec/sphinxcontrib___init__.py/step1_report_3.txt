  "purpose": "Declare a namespace for a package using pkg_resources.",
  "sources": "The code imports the pkg_resources module and declares a namespace using __name__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; only namespace declaration occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no unusual patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a well-known package and declares a namespace, which is common in Python packaging. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activities. The absence of additional code or data handling reduces the likelihood of malicious intent. This appears to be standard namespace declaration code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace declaration using pkg_resources, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
