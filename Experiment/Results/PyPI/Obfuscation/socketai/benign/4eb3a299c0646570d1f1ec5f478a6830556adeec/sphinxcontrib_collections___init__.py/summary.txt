  "conclusion": "The import statement from a legitimate package with an obfuscated symbol name raises suspicion but does not demonstrate malicious intent on its own. The high obfuscation score is justified, but without additional context or code, the likelihood of malware or significant security risk remains low. Continued monitoring and further code analysis are recommended to confirm or dismiss potential malicious behavior."
