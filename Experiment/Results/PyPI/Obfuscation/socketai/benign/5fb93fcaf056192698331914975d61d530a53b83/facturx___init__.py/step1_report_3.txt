  "purpose": "Importing multiple symbols from the local module '.facturx'.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from the local module '.facturx' via import statements.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to external systems are present; no untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Data flow involves importing multiple obfuscated symbols from the same module; no external or untrusted data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "All imported identifiers appear as random strings or obfuscated variable names, suggesting possible obfuscation. No explicit secrets, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious patterns detected. The code contains only import statements, with no additional logic or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a single import statement that pulls multiple symbols with obfuscated or nonsensical names from a local module '.facturx'. The import list does not include any functions, classes, or code execution. The identifiers are all non-descriptive and appear to be intentionally obfuscated, which could suggest malicious intent or simply an obfuscation technique. There are no apparent data flows to external systems, no code injection, no handling of untrusted input, nor any suspicious behavior such as network connections or file manipulations. Given the limited content, there is no evidence of malicious activity, but the obfuscated nature warrants caution and further context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with obfuscated symbol names from a local module. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident in this snippet. The obfuscation could be benign or malicious, but based solely on this, it does not show any malicious intent.",
