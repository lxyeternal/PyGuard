  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate PDF to XML extraction utility with heavy obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The obfuscation may be for intellectual property protection rather than malicious concealment. The overall security risk is low, but caution should be exercised regarding the external library's integrity."
