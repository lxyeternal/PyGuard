  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with low malware likelihood. Heavy obfuscation and dynamic code in report 4 warrant caution, justifying higher obfuscation and malware scores. Overall, the assessments are consistent and reasonable; no definitive malicious activity is confirmed. Slightly increasing malware score for report 4 to 0.4 and risk to 0.5 would better reflect the suspicion level."
