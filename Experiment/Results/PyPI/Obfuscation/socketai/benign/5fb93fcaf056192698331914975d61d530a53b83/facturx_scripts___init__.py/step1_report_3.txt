  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform data processing and possibly network communication, but without further context, it is unclear if it has a malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input data may be read from environment variables, user input functions, or network sockets (if present).",
  "sinks": "Data may be sent over network connections, written to files, or used in system commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources like input functions or environment variables to sinks such as network sockets or file I/O, potentially via intermediate processing steps.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious dynamic code execution, or unusual obfuscation detected. No apparent malicious payloads or backdoors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed for typical supply chain risks, including malicious imports, obfuscated code, or hidden backdoors. It uses standard libraries without suspicious modifications. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated sections observed. Data flows seem benign and typical for data processing scripts. No network connections to suspicious domains or exfiltration mechanisms were detected.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no apparent signs of malicious behavior or supply chain compromise. The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose, with no suspicious activity observed.",
