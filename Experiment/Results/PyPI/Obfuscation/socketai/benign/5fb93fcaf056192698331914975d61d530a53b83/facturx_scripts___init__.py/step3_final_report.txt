  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Input functions, environment variables, network requests, file I/O, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file system, environment variables, system commands, dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as input/env to sinks like network, files, or eval/exec via processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), unusual variable naming, lack of code comments, potential hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits typical benign patterns in reports 1-3 with no suspicious activity. Report 4 shows heavy obfuscation and dynamic code execution, increasing suspicion. Report 5 hints at potential risks like eval/exec but lacks concrete code. The scores reflect these observations: benign scripts score low on malware and risk; obfuscated code and dynamic execution increase suspicion. The reasoning aligns with the described features, and scores are appropriate given the evidence. The highest concern is in report 4, where obfuscation and dynamic code suggest moderate malicious potential.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with low malware likelihood. Heavy obfuscation and dynamic code in report 4 warrant caution, justifying higher obfuscation and malware scores. Overall, the assessments are consistent and reasonable; no definitive malicious activity is confirmed. Slightly increasing malware score for report 4 to 0.4 and risk to 0.5 would better reflect the suspicion level.",
