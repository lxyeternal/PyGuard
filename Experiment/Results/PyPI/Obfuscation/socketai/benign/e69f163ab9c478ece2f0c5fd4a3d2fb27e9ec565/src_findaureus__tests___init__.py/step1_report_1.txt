  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a specific function or task, but without seeing the actual code, the exact intent cannot be determined.",
  "sources": "Data is read from environment variables, user input, or external files; however, the specific input sources are not provided in the prompt.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or execution functions, but specific locations are not available in the prompt.",
  "flows": "Data flow likely involves input sources passing through processing functions to sinks such as network or file systems; precise paths cannot be identified without code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious function calls are observable due to lack of provided code.",
  "analysis": "The review is limited by the absence of the actual code snippet. No source, sink, or flow details are available, preventing identification of suspicious behavior or malicious intent. No anomalies or unusual code structures are visible. Without concrete code, it is impossible to detect embedded malware, hardcoded secrets, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The review cannot definitively determine intent or risks without the actual code content.",
