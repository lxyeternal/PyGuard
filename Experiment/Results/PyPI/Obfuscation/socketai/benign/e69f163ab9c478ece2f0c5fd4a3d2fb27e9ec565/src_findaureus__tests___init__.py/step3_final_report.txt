  "purpose": "To evaluate open-source Python dependency reports for malicious behavior or security risks, considering code content, anomalies, and patterns.",
  "sources": "Not applicable; no code provided in the reports.",
  "sinks": "Not applicable; no untrusted data flows identified due to absence of code.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; analysis limited by lack of code snippets.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; reports acknowledge absence of code and suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly recognize the absence of code, limiting definitive analysis. They appropriately assign low or zero malware and obfuscation scores, with cautious security risk scores (0.2) reflecting potential concerns like dynamic features. Confidence levels vary but remain appropriate given the context. No evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation is observed, and the scores are consistent with the reasoning.",
  "conclusion": "Given the lack of code, all reports are justified in assigning minimal or zero risk and malware scores. The cautious security risk scores acknowledge potential but unconfirmed concerns. Overall, the assessments are consistent, reasonable, and conservative, requiring no adjustments.",
