{
  "purpose": "The code defines two functions that create a napari viewer, add images, interact with custom widgets, and perform assertions on output strings related to layer operations. It appears to be for testing or demonstration purposes of GUI components.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function calls (make_napari_viewer, capsys), creates viewer instances, adds images, and invokes widget methods.",
  "sinks": "Output strings from widget methods and assertions, primarily printing or returning layer information; no external data leaks or network activity are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from viewer creation and image addition to widget method invocation, culminating in output assertions that verify layer states.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of variable and function names, which may be superficial. No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard GUI testing routines with obfuscated identifiers. It creates viewer instances, adds images, interacts with widgets, and asserts expected output. No network activity, file access, or credential handling is observed. Obfuscation appears superficial, likely to hinder readability rather than conceal malicious intent. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are detected. The high obfuscation scores reflect the naming style, but overall, the code is benign and typical of testing scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily serving as GUI testing or demonstration scripts with superficial obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain threats, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with this assessment.",
