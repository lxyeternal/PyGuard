{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be for testing or demonstrating interaction with a napari viewer and custom widgets, specifically adding images and selecting layers.",
  "sources": "Input sources include the function parameters 'make_napari_viewer' and 'capsys'. The 'make_napari_viewer' function is expected to generate a viewer object, and 'capsys' captures output streams.",
  "sinks": "The code captures output from capsys.readouterr() and asserts on the 'out' attribute, but there are no direct sinks leading to data leaks or external effects. No other suspicious sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input functions generate viewer objects; these are manipulated by adding images and selecting layers. The output is captured and checked, with no data flow to external systems or networks.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains obfuscated function names and variable names (e.g., 'hacvdxVcnhchiryApjHnxADcjkGzjXEB'), which could be an attempt to hide intent. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code patterns are evident. The code performs standard widget interactions and assertions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports numpy and a custom module 'fandaureus', then defines two functions for testing interactions with a napari viewer. Both functions create viewer instances, add images, and invoke widget methods, capturing output. The obfuscated naming might suggest an attempt to conceal purpose, but the operations are typical of testing UI interactions. No network activity, code injection, or malicious actions are present. No suspicious data handling or backdoors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard testing or demonstration tasks involving a napari viewer and custom widgets. Despite obfuscated identifiers, no malicious or security-threatening behavior is evident. The code appears to be benign.",
