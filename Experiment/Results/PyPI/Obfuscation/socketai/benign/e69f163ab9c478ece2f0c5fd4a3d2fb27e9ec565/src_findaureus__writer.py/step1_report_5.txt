  "purpose": "Define two functions that return the provided path parameter as a list containing the same path string.",
  "sources": "Function parameters: 'path', 'VklGEYQZvbxRsqlenBevxvMOAuRSGLVb', and 'meta'.",
  "sinks": "Return statements that output a list containing 'path'.",
  "flows": "Parameters are taken as input; the functions simply return the 'path' wrapped in a list, with no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Use of TYPE_CHECKING for type aliases; no hardcoded secrets, no code execution, no network calls, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines type aliases within a TYPE_CHECKING block, which are used for static type hints but do not affect runtime behavior. Two functions accept parameters and return the 'path' parameter inside a list. No dynamic code execution, no data leaks, and no malicious logic are present. The functions are trivial and do not perform any side effects or suspicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing simple data wrapping with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
