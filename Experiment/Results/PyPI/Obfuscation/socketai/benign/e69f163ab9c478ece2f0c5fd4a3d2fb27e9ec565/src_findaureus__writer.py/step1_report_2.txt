  "purpose": "Define type aliases and two functions that return their input paths in a list.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'path', 'VklGEYQZvbxRsqlenBevxvMOAuRSGLVb', and 'meta'.",
  "sinks": "Return statements output the 'path' parameter within a list.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are directly returned in the output without modification.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names; no actual processing or logic beyond returning input paths.",
  "analysis": "The code defines type aliases with obfuscated names and two functions that simply return the provided 'path' argument encapsulated in a list. There are no data transformations, no external input handling, no network connections, or side effects. The functions do not perform any malicious operations, nor do they contain suspicious logic or obfuscated behavior. The variable names appear intentionally obscure but do not influence functionality or security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, with no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be simple boilerplate or placeholder functions with obfuscated variable names. No indicators of malware or security threats are present.",
