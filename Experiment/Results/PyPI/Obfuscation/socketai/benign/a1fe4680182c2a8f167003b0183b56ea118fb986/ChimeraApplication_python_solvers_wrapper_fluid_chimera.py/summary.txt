  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard plugin loader with obfuscated naming and dynamic import patterns. No malicious activity or payloads are evident. The obfuscation and dynamic import introduce moderate risk, but current evidence does not suggest malicious intent. Continuous validation of imported modules and cautious environment management are recommended."
