  "purpose": "Dynamically loads solver modules based on runtime parameters for KratosMultiphysics, enabling flexible solver configuration.",
  "sources": "custom_settings['solver_type'], custom_settings['problem_data']['parallel_type'], input parameters for solver type and parallelism",
  "sinks": "import_module to load solver modules, CreateSolver function call within imported modules",
  "flows": "Extract solver type and parallel type -> construct module path string -> import module -> call CreateSolver with model and settings",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable and function names, dynamic import based on runtime strings, exception handling for invalid parameters",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard plugin loading with input validation and dynamic module import. Obfuscated naming suggests potential concealment but is not inherently malicious. No network, file, or system modifications are present. The dynamic import pattern could be exploited if parameters are manipulated maliciously, but no evidence of malicious payloads or behaviors is observed. The scores assigned in reports are consistent with the benign nature of the code, with obfuscation and dynamic import raising moderate caution. Overall, the code appears legitimate but warrants environment validation and monitoring.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard plugin loader with obfuscated naming and dynamic import patterns. No malicious activity or payloads are evident. The obfuscation and dynamic import introduce moderate risk, but current evidence does not suggest malicious intent. Continuous validation of imported modules and cautious environment management are recommended.",
