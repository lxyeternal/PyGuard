{
  "purpose": "This code configures and manages a rotation process within Kratos Multiphysics, validating parameters and invoking an external process for rotating model parts.",
  "sources": "Parameters provided via 'settings' object, reading model part names, rotation axes, and control flags.",
  "sinks": "No external data exfiltration, network activity, or file I/O detected; primarily modifies model parts internally.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow from 'settings' into validation routines, then into the 'RotateRegionProcess', with process info used for interval checks.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are obfuscated or nonsensical; dynamic removal of 'interval' and 'torque_model_part_name' from settings; minimal comments; possible code obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs parameter validation, including checks for zero vectors and conflicting flags, then initializes a rotation process. Obfuscated variable names and dynamic setting modifications suggest obfuscation, but no malicious actions such as network activity, file manipulation, or system access are evident. The process appears to be a legitimate physics simulation wrapper, with validation and process invocation following standard patterns. The obfuscation may be due to code generation or minification rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate process configuration for Kratos Multiphysics, with no evidence of malicious behavior. Obfuscation raises some suspicion but does not confirm malicious activity. Overall, the code is low risk and safe for use, though obfuscation should be monitored.",
