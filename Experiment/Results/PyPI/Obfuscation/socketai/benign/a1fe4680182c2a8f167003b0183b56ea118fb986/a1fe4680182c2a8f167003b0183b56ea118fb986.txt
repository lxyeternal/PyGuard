      "obfuscated": 0.8,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, albeit heavily obfuscated, implementation of a CFD solver with Chimera support. There are no signs of malicious activity, malware, or sabotage. The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not elevate the security risk significantly. The overall malware score is 0, security risk is low, but the obfuscation score is high, reflecting potential concealment."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard plugin loader with obfuscated naming and dynamic import patterns. No malicious activity or payloads are evident. The obfuscation and dynamic import introduce moderate risk, but current evidence does not suggest malicious intent. Continuous validation of imported modules and cautious environment management are recommended."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign initialization routine for KratosMultiphysics' Chimera application, with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not justify a malware classification. The security risk is low, and the malware score should remain at 0. The obfuscation score is high due to variable name obscurity, but overall, the code appears safe."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate process configuration for Kratos Multiphysics, with no evidence of malicious behavior. Obfuscation raises some suspicion but does not confirm malicious activity. Overall, the code is low risk and safe for use, though obfuscation should be monitored."

      "conclusion": "The code is a complex, obfuscated setup script for Chimera multiphysics processes within Kratos. Despite the high obfuscation, there is no evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or supply chain compromise. The operations are consistent with legitimate configuration and process application routines. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score should remain at 0."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate-looking simulation wrapper with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious activity within this code snippet. The main concern is the external wrapper function, which should be inspected to rule out malicious behavior. The current security scores are appropriate given the evidence."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, complex utility for managing model parts and materials in KratosMultiphysics, with high obfuscation and some suspicious file deletion routines. There is no concrete evidence of malicious activity, but the file cleanup functions and heavy obfuscation suggest a need for careful review before deployment in sensitive environments."
