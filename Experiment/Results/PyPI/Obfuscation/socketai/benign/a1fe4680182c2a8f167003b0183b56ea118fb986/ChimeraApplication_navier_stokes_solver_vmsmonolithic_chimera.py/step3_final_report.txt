{
  "purpose": "A specialized solver class for Kratos Multiphysics with Chimera support, involving variable setup, model import, and solver configuration.",
  "sources": "Imports modules, reads settings, and loads model parts from files.",
  "sinks": "Adds nodal solution variables, imports model parts, and configures solver components; no external data transfer or network activity.",
  "flows": "Settings and configuration data flow into variable additions and model import functions; no external data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and function names, but no suspicious hardcoded secrets, network activity, or malicious commands.",
  "analysis": "The code is a complex, obfuscated solver extension for Kratos, performing standard simulation setup tasks. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration are evident. Obfuscation may be for proprietary reasons. The code interacts with files and model parts in a typical manner for scientific software.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate and intended for simulation purposes. No malicious activity or security threats are detected. Obfuscation is notable but not indicative of malicious intent in this context.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.7,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.2,
