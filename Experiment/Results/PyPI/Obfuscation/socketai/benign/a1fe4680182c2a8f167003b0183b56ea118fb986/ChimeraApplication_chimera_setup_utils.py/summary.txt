  "conclusion": "The code is a complex, obfuscated setup script for Chimera multiphysics processes within Kratos. Despite the high obfuscation, there is no evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or supply chain compromise. The operations are consistent with legitimate configuration and process application routines. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score should remain at 0."
