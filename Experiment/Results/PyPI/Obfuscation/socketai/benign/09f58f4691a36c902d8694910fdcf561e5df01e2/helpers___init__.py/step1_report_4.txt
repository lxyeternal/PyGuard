  "purpose": "Assignment of a version string to a variable, likely indicating a package version.",
  "sources": "Assignment statement where the string '0.0.7' is assigned to a variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Simple variable assignment; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The variable name appears obfuscated or random; no meaningful context or standard naming convention.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a variable assignment with a seemingly random variable name. There are no inputs, no data processing, and no use of external data sources. The value assigned is a static string representing a version number, which is common in package metadata. The variable name does not match typical naming conventions and may be obfuscated, but this alone is not malicious. No other code present to suggest malicious intent or malicious data flow.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple variable assignment indicating a version number. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks. The unusual variable name is likely obfuscation but does not imply malicious activity.",
