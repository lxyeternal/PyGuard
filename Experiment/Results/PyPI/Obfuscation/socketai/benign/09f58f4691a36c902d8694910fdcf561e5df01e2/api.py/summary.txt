  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate tool for exporting GitLab data, with obfuscation as the main suspicious element. No direct evidence of malware or malicious sabotage is present in this snippet. The high obfuscation scores reflect suspicion, but the low malware and risk scores are justified given the current evidence. Further investigation of the helper modules is recommended to rule out concealed malicious routines."
