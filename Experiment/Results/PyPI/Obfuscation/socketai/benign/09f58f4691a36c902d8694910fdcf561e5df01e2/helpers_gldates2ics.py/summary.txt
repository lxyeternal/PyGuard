  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate utility for exporting GitLab project milestones and issues into a calendar format. The high obfuscation of class and method names is suspicious but does not demonstrate malicious activity. No signs of malware, data theft, or sabotage are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0.8, risk=0.2) are appropriate given the evidence. Continued monitoring and static analysis are recommended if used in security-sensitive contexts."
