  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for exporting GitLab issues, with obfuscated naming that raises suspicion but no evidence of malicious behavior. The malware score remains at 0.1, obfuscation at 0.75, and overall security risk at 0.2, reflecting low risk primarily due to obfuscation. No active malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection is detected. The supply chain risk is low, but obfuscation warrants caution if used in untrusted environments."
