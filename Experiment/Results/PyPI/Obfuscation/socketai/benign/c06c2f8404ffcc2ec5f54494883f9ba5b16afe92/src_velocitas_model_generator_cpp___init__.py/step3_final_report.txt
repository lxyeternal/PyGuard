  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, network/file operations, standard libraries.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, print statements.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or user input to sinks like network or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected; code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code snippets. Malware scores are zero, indicating no malicious intent. Security risk scores are mostly 0.2 or lower, reflecting minimal concern given the descriptions. Confidence levels are appropriate, considering the limited code context. No obfuscation or malicious activity is evident. The assessments are consistent and justified based on the provided information.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets are benign, with no signs of malicious or obfuscated behavior. The scoring aligns with the analysis, and no adjustments are necessary.",
