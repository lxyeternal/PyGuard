      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code demonstrates potential security risks primarily through dynamic execution and obfuscation tactics, but lacks concrete evidence of malicious payloads. The scores assigned are generally appropriate, with a justified elevation of risk in report 1 due to insecure handling of untrusted data. Minor adjustments to malware scores could be considered if further evidence of malicious activity emerges."

      "conclusion": "The script appears to be a utility for converting vspec files into vehicle models, with significant obfuscation that could be used to hide malicious intent. No explicit malicious actions are evident in this snippet, but the external function and obfuscation warrant further review before trusting or deploying this code. The low malware scores are appropriate given the lack of direct malicious activity, but caution is advised due to obfuscation and external dependencies."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate but poorly written or obfuscated utility for code/model generation supporting Python and C++. It does not exhibit signs of malware, supply chain attack, or malicious payloads. The main concerns are superficial obfuscation, typographical and exception handling bugs, and the use of directory deletion which could be destructive if misused. The overall security risk is low to moderate, with no malicious activity detected."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign internal utility for text and code formatting with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious activity, network communication, or security vulnerabilities. The high obfuscation score is justified, and the malware score should remain at 0.0. The overall security risk is low (~0.2), primarily due to obfuscation but without malicious intent."

      "conclusion": "The code is a complex, heavily obfuscated C++ code generator with no direct evidence of malicious activity. While the obfuscation raises suspicion, there are no signs of malware, data theft, or sabotage. The moderate security risk is mainly due to obfuscation, which could be exploited to hide malicious payloads. Overall, it appears to be a legitimate code generation tool with a high level of obfuscation, necessitating vigilant review if deployed in sensitive environments."

Scores are consistent with the described behaviors, with report 3 warranting the highest concern. Further static and dynamic analysis is recommended before deployment."

No active malware or malicious intent is detected. The low malware score (around 0.1) and moderate obfuscation (around 0.6) are justified. Proper validation of node inputs is recommended to mitigate injection risks."
