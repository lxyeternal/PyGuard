  "purpose": "A utility for processing and formatting text, managing code snippets with indentation and line management.",
  "sources": "Input string parameter, regex tokenization of input, internal data structures (model_code list).",
  "sinks": "Internal storage in model_code, no external data transmission or system modification.",
  "flows": "Input string -> regex parsing -> tokens -> stored in model_code -> joined and managed internally.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and class names, complex internal logic without external interactions, no malicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs regex-based tokenization of input strings, manages code snippets with indentation levels, and stores lines internally. No network activity, file I/O, or system modifications are present. Obfuscation is high, but the logic is benign and consistent with a code or text formatting utility. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are detected. The obfuscation likely aims to conceal purpose but does not indicate malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware near 0, high obfuscation, low to moderate risk) are justified based on the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign internal utility for text and code formatting with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious activity, network communication, or security vulnerabilities. The high obfuscation score is justified, and the malware score should remain at 0.0. The overall security risk is low (~0.2), primarily due to obfuscation but without malicious intent.",
