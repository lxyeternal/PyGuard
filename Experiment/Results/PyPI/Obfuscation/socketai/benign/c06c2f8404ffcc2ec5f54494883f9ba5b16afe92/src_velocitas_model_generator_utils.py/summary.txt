  "conclusion": "The code is a benign internal utility for text and code formatting with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious activity, network communication, or security vulnerabilities. The high obfuscation score is justified, and the malware score should remain at 0.0. The overall security risk is low (~0.2), primarily due to obfuscation but without malicious intent."
