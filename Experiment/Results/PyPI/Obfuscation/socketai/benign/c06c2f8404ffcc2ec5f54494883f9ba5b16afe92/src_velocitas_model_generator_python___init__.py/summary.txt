  "conclusion": "The overall assessment indicates moderate supply chain security concern primarily due to report 3's obfuscated and potentially malicious code. Scores are consistent with the described behaviors, with report 3 warranting the highest concern. Further static and dynamic analysis is recommended before deployment."
