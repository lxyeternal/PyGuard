  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be related to data processing or network communication, but the specific intent is unclear without detailed context.",
  "sources": "Potential data sources include environment variables, user input functions, or file reads (if present). However, the provided code does not explicitly show data sources.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, file writes, or execution of dynamic code. The code does not show explicit sinks, but any use of eval, exec, or network connections would be critical.",
  "flows": "The flow of data from sources to sinks cannot be fully determined due to lack of specific code snippets. No clear source-to-sink paths are observable from the provided code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual language features are detected. The code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code lacks visible malicious constructs such as network connections to suspicious domains, data exfiltration, or backdoors. No use of eval or exec with untrusted data is evident. There are no hardcoded secrets or suspicious imports. The structure is typical and does not suggest obfuscation or malware. Without additional context or code, it is difficult to identify malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no clear signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, but the absence of specific details limits confidence. No suspicious patterns or anomalies are detected.",
