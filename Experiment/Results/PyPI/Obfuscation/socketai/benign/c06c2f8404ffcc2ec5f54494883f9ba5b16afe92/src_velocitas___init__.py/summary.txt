  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates potential security risks primarily through dynamic execution and obfuscation tactics, but lacks concrete evidence of malicious payloads. The scores assigned are generally appropriate, with a justified elevation of risk in report 1 due to insecure handling of untrusted data. Minor adjustments to malware scores could be considered if further evidence of malicious activity emerges."
