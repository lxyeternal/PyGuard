The notable concern is the use of exec() on 'delta_sharing/version.py'. If this file is malicious or compromised, executing its contents could execute arbitrary code on the system. This is a common pattern in setup scripts to load version info, but it introduces potential risk if the version file is tampered with or malicious. No other suspicious activity or malicious behavior is evident.\",\n  \"conclusion\": \"The code is a standard setup script with the only notable security concern being the execution of an external version file via exec(). If the version file is trusted and from a reliable source, the risk is minimal. However, the use of exec() without validation could potentially be exploited if the file content is malicious.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.7,\n  \"obfuscated\": 0,\n  \"malware\": 0,\n  \"securityRisk\": 0.4\n}",
