  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with a common pattern ('exec' for versioning). No evidence of malicious activity is detected. The main risk stems from executing external code during setup, which can be mitigated by verifying the version file. Scores should be malware=0, obfuscated=0.2, risk=0.3, reflecting low malware likelihood but acknowledging supply chain concerns."
