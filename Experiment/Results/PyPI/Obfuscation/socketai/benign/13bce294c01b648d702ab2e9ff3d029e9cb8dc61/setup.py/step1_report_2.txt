{
  "purpose": "The code is for setting up a Python package called 'Python Connector for Delta Sharing', including reading the README and version files for packaging.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file, reading and executing 'delta_sharing/version.py' to get version info, and the setup() function parameters for package configuration.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'delta_sharing/version.py' via exec(), which could run arbitrary code from that file.",
  "flows": "Reading version.py (source) -> exec() (sink) -> potential execution of untrusted code, followed by package setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to run code from an external file ('delta_sharing/version.py') is potentially dangerous if the file contents are malicious or compromised.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs package setup tasks. It reads a README file and attempts to execute 'delta_sharing/version.py' to obtain version info. The use of exec() is a known security concern because it can execute arbitrary code if 'version.py' is compromised. No other suspicious or malicious behavior is detected. The rest of the code involves defining package metadata and dependencies, which are typical for setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The main concern is the use of exec() on an external file, which could execute malicious code if the file is tampered with. Otherwise, the script is standard for Python package setup with no evidence of malware or malicious behavior.",
