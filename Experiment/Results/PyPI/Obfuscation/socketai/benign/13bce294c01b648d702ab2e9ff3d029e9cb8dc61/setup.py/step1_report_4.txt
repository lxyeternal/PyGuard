  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the Delta Sharing Python connector, including reading version info and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file for long description, reads 'delta_sharing/version.py' for version info, and gathers environment info for setup.",
  "sinks": "None present that process untrusted data; no data leaks or insecure operations detected.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows detected; reading files and setting up package metadata only.",
  "anomalies": "The code executes 'delta_sharing/version.py' via 'exec', which could be risky if the file is malicious or altered, as it allows arbitrary code execution during setup.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup procedures: reading README, executing a version file, and calling 'setuptools.setup'. The use of 'exec' on 'delta_sharing/version.py' is a potential concern because it executes arbitrary code, but if this file is controlled and secure, it is typical in package versioning. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious network calls, or malicious operations are present. The rest of the code is conventional setup.py behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard setup.py with the only notable risk being the execution of an external version file via 'exec'. This is a common pattern but could be a vector if the version file is compromised. No malicious intent or malware behavior detected.",
