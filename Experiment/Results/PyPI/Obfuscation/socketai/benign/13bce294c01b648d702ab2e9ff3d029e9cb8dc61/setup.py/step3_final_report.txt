  "purpose": "Standard setup.py script for packaging the delta sharing Python project, reading README, executing version.py for version info, and configuring dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; executes 'delta_sharing/version.py' via exec() to load version info.",
  "sinks": "exec() call on 'version.py' potentially executes external code; no other untrusted data sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Reads files, then executes 'version.py' with exec(), which could run malicious code if the file is compromised.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on an external version file; obfuscated variable names; minimal error handling.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup configuration with standard practices. The main security concern is the use of exec() to load version info, which could execute malicious code if 'delta_sharing/version.py' is tampered with. No malicious payloads or backdoors are present. Variable obfuscation is superficial and not malicious. The code does not perform network operations or data leaks. The scores from reports correctly reflect low malware (0), slight obfuscation (around 0.2), and moderate risk (around 0.3) due to exec(). Ensuring the integrity of 'version.py' mitigates the primary supply chain risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with a common pattern ('exec' for versioning). No evidence of malicious activity is detected. The main risk stems from executing external code during setup, which can be mitigated by verifying the version file. Scores should be malware=0, obfuscated=0.2, risk=0.3, reflecting low malware likelihood but acknowledging supply chain concerns.",
