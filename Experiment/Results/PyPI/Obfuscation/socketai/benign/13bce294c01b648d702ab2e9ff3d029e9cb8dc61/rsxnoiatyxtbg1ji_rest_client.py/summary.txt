  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, albeit obfuscated, client library for Delta Sharing. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The obfuscation warrants cautious review but does not elevate the security risk. The malware score is 0, and the overall security risk is low."
