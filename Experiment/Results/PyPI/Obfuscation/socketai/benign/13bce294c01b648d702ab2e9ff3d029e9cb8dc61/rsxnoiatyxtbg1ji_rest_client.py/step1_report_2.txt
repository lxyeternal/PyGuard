{
  "purpose": "The code appears to implement a client for interacting with Delta Sharing services, including authentication, data sharing, schema and table metadata retrieval, and query execution.",
  "sources": "Data is read from network responses via requests.Session, URL parsing, and server responses; also from function parameters such as share names, schema, table details, and query options.",
  "sinks": "Network requests and responses; data passed into requests; handling of response content, including potential deserialization of server responses and error messages.",
  "flows": "Inputs from function parameters and network responses flow into request construction; network responses are processed, deserialized, and used to generate return objects; error handling may involve re-authentication or retries.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; the code uses external libraries for network and data processing; includes retry logic and error handling. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data classes for structured data handling, a retry decorator, and a client class for Delta Sharing API interaction. It constructs URLs based on input parameters, manages an HTTP session, handles network errors with retries, and deserializes server responses. There is a focus on proper error handling, token refresh logic, and response parsing. No indicators of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are present. Usage of requests and standard Python libraries suggests legitimate functionality aimed at data sharing operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate client implementation for Delta Sharing, handling network communication, retries, and data serialization/deserialization. No malicious or sabotage behavior detected. It primarily manages data requests and responses with appropriate error handling.",
