  "purpose": "A Python client library for Delta Sharing, handling authentication, request retries, and data retrieval from Delta Sharing endpoints.",
  "sources": "HTTP request inputs, environment variables, request parameters, response data streams",
  "sinks": "Network requests and responses, response parsing, session management",
  "flows": "Input parameters and environment variables influence request construction; responses are parsed and returned as structured data classes",
  "anomalies": "Use of heavily obfuscated import and variable names; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns; complex request handling but no malicious logic",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured API client with retry logic, session management, and data serialization. Obfuscated names suggest code obfuscation or auto-generation but do not indicate malicious intent. No signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. Error handling and token refresh mechanisms are standard. The obfuscation level is high but consistent with code protection practices. No suspicious data flows or malicious sinks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, albeit obfuscated, client library for Delta Sharing. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The obfuscation warrants cautious review but does not elevate the security risk. The malware score is 0, and the overall security risk is low.",
