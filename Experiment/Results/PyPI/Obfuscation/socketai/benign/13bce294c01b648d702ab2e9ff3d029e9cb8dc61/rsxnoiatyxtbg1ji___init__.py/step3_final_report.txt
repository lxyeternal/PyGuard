  "purpose": "Import specific classes and functions from the delta_sharing package to expose a public API for data sharing functionalities.",
  "sources": "Import statements from delta_sharing.delta_sharing, delta_sharing.protocol, and delta_sharing.version modules.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or handle untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow or runtime logic; only static imports and API exposure.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated or nonsensical identifiers for imported classes and functions, which is unusual for open-source code and may indicate obfuscation or auto-generation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with obfuscated names and an __all__ list defining public API symbols. No data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The obfuscated identifiers are suspicious but could be due to internal naming conventions or code minification. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities are evident from this snippet. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware and security risk scores should remain low, reflecting the benign nature of the code. Further review of the actual imported modules is recommended to confirm no malicious payloads are hidden.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard package initialization or API exposure module with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security threats in this fragment. The obfuscation warrants further investigation into the imported modules, but based solely on this snippet, the security risk is minimal.",
