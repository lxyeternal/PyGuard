{
  "purpose": "The code appears to implement mathematical functions likely related to some form of scientific or engineering computation, possibly involving physical modeling or parameter estimation.",
  "sources": "Inputs are r, owVXXplgzrtDIhZpPVrHcibitxXLQkww, q, GBIBFJVsZaljcxDSZnJDvFRpKCmHomCy, alpha0, which seem to be parameters or data values passed into the functions.",
  "sinks": "The functions do not include any data output, network communication, file operations, or system modifications; they primarily perform mathematical calculations and return results.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used in calculations leading directly to returned values; no external data flow beyond function inputs/outputs is evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains complex mathematical expressions but no hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns. No suspicious code structures, obfuscation, or hidden behavior are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions performing advanced mathematical operations involving numpy and multiple parameters. Both functions use inputs to calculate intermediate variables, including powers, square roots, and conditional numpy where clauses. There are no indications of input validation or security-related logic. No network calls, file access, or system commands are present. The computations seem to be part of a scientific model or calculation routine. No signs of malicious activity or sabotage are detected. The code appears straightforward, with no obfuscation or hidden malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of mathematical functions for parameter calculations, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs complex calculations but does not include any harmful operations or suspicious code patterns.",
