  "purpose": "The code appears to perform mathematical computations involving parameters that could relate to physical or statistical models, potentially for simulation or analysis purposes.",
  "sources": "Data inputs are r, owVXXplgzrtDIhZpPVrHcibitxXLQkww, q, GBIBFJVsZaljcxDSZnJDvFRpKCmHomCy, alpha0, which are used in calculations. No external data sources or inputs are explicitly read besides function parameters.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs are floating-point calculations via return statements; there are no evident data leaks or network operations. However, the use of np.where with untrusted inputs could potentially influence behavior if inputs are maliciously crafted.",
  "flows": "Inputs are processed through various mathematical transformations within the functions, leading to outputs based on complex formulas involving source parameters. No external sinks like network or file I/O are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains extremely convoluted variable names, suggesting obfuscation. It performs intricate mathematical operations but no explicit malicious actions like network access or file modification. It uses np.where to conditionally compute results based on input values, which is normal in numerical computations. There are no hardcoded credentials or obvious backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions performing advanced mathematical calculations with multiple intermediate variables. Both functions process inputs and produce floating-point outputs based on complex formulas involving ratios, powers, and conditions. No signs of malicious code, such as network operations, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are present. The variable naming style and the complexity might hint at obfuscation, but the logic remains within normal mathematical computation patterns. The functions do not seem to perform any harmful actions or data leaks. The use of np.where and mathematical operations is consistent with scientific or simulation code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate mathematical computation code, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The complexity and naming conventions suggest possible obfuscation but not malicious intent. It can be considered safe based on the provided analysis.",
