  "purpose": "The code appears to perform complex mathematical calculations involving multiple parameters, likely for scientific or simulation purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters r, owVXXplgzrtDIhZpPVrHcibitxXLQkww, q, GBIBFJVsZaljcxDSZnJDvFRpKCmHomCy, alpha0",
  "sinks": "Returns computed values based on input data; no external data or system actions observed",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into mathematical expressions; results are returned but not used in external system calls or network operations",
  "anomalies": "Use of extremely small constants (1.e-100) to avoid division by zero; complex, obscure calculations without clear purpose; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors; no obfuscated code or suspicious function calls",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two functions performing mathematical operations using numpy. It reads input parameters, computes several intermediate variables involving division, powers, and conditions, then returns a computed value. No external data sources, network connections, or system modifications are present. The calculations do not appear malicious; they seem to serve domain-specific computational purposes. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are detected. The code is complex but not obfuscated maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs complex mathematical computations without any signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be scientific or simulation-related code with no indications of malware or supply chain sabotage.",
