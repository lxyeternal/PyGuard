  "purpose": "The code defines two functions performing complex mathematical calculations involving numpy, likely for scientific or physical modeling purposes.",
  "sources": "Parameters r, owVXXplgzrtDIhZpPVrHcibitxXLQkww, q, GBIBFJVsZaljcxDSZnJDvFRpKCmHomCy, alpha0; input parameters used in calculations.",
  "sinks": "No external data leaks, network calls, or system modifications; computations are self-contained.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into mathematical expressions and conditional numpy.where statements, producing scalar or array outputs based on input values.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are complex and obscure, which could suggest obfuscation, but no malicious patterns or dynamic code execution are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs numerical computations typical of scientific modeling, with safeguards like tiny constants to prevent division errors. No signs of malicious activity such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The obfuscation level is minimal and appears to be due to variable naming rather than malicious intent. The code's structure and calculations are consistent with legitimate scientific routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for scientific or engineering calculations, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is low (~0.2), and overall security risk is minimal (~0.2). The assessments in the provided reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
