  "purpose": "Re-exporting specific functions and classes from a module within the dustpylib.radtrans.slab package for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from dustpylib.radtrans.slab.slab module",
  "sinks": "No direct sink of untrusted data or external effect; simple re-exporting",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; only static imports and exports",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports three items from an internal module of the dustpylib package and defines __all__ for export. No user input, external network access, or suspicious logic is present. The structure is standard for module re-exports. No obfuscation or malicious constructs identified.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward re-export module with no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues. It serves as a public interface for selected components of the dustpylib.radtrans.slab.slab module.",
