  "purpose": "Modules related to dynamical extensions, potentially involving dynamic code loading or modification.",
  "sources": "No actual code snippets provided; descriptions mention dynamical extensions but lack concrete input points.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks identified; potential concern if dynamic execution functions (eval, exec) are used insecurely, but no evidence present.",
  "flows": "Not specified; hypothetical source-to-sink paths involve dynamic code execution points, but none are confirmed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns evident from descriptions.",
  "analysis": "The reports are based solely on module descriptions without actual code snippets. All scores for malware and obfuscation are zero, aligning with the absence of concrete malicious indicators. Risk scores are low (0.1–0.2), reflecting cautious acknowledgment of potential dynamic behaviors but no evidence of misuse. Confidence levels are moderate to low due to limited information. The cautious approach is appropriate; without actual code, definitive security concerns cannot be confirmed. The scores and conclusions across reports are consistent and reasonable given the data.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided descriptions, there is no evidence of malicious or obfuscated code. The low risk and malware scores are justified, and the assessments are appropriate. To improve security assurance, actual code review is recommended, especially to verify the safe use of dynamic execution functions. Currently, the package appears benign with minimal risk.",
