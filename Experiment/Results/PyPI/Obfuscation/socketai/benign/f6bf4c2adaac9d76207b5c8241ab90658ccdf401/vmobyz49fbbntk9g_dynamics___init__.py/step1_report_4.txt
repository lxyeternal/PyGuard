  "purpose": "Modules related to dynamical extensions, likely intended to extend or modify existing functionality dynamically.",
  "sources": "Potential data inputs from external modules, environment variables, or runtime parameters (not explicitly shown in the snippet).",
  "sinks": "Possible points where untrusted data could be used for dynamic code execution, file operations, or network communication (not explicitly shown).",
  "flows": "Not enough code provided to establish specific source-to-sink data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No explicit code or detailed implementation provided; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns identified in the brief description.",
  "analysis": "The provided description is minimal, only stating that the package contains modules related to dynamical extensions. Without detailed code, it's not possible to identify malicious behavior, anomalies, or security issues. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious actions, or security risks in the information given.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the limited information, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The package appears to be for modular extensions, but without further code, the security assessment cannot be comprehensive.",
