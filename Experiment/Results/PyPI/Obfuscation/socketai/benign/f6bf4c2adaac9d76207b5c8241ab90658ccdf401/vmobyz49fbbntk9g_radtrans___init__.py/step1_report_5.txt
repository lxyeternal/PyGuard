{
  "purpose": "The code exports two functions or classes, 'radmc3d' and 'slab', from the 'dustpylib.radtrans' module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'dustpylib.radtrans' module.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks or data outputs; no untrusted data handling or external data flow points.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code simply defines an export list.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated elements. The code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific components from an external library ('dustpylib.radtrans') and declares an explicit '__all__' list for module exports. There are no data inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious code are present. It appears to be a standard module interface definition.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, benign code snippet that exposes selected functions or classes from an external library for use elsewhere. There are no indications of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated code.",
