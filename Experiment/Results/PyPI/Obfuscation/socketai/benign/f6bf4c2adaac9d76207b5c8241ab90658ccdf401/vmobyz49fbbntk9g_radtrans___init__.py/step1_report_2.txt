  "purpose": "The code re-exports specific functions or classes from the dustpylib.radtrans module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from dustpylib.radtrans for 'radmc3d' and 'slab'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, no data leaks, no external effects observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code merely re-exports imported components.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with no unusual patterns or hardcoded secrets; no obfuscation or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific components from an external library and defines an export list. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious code constructs. The code's simplicity and lack of dynamic execution or external communications suggest it is a straightforward module setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears benign, serving as a module re-export for specified functions/classes from a library. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
