{
  "purpose": "Re-exports modules 'radmc3d' and 'slab' from the 'dustpylib.radtrans' package for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'dustpylib.radtrans' to load specific functions or classes.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or leaked; no functions or data flows observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink is present in this snippet; only module imports and an export list.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors detected. The code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two modules from an external library and defines an '__all__' list for exports. It does not perform any input/output operations, data processing, or network activity. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are present. The simplicity indicates it is likely part of a module's interface definition.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign module import and export declaration with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It is standard practice for organizing package exports.",
