{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define the exports for a module related to dust radiative transfer, specifically re-exporting parts of the 'dustpylib.radtrans' library.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'dustpylib.radtrans', which are used to bring in specific functions or classes into the current namespace.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating data processing or output that could lead to data leaks or malicious activity.",
  "flows": "No evident source-to-sink data flows; the code merely imports and re-exports modules.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures detected. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two modules or classes from a library called 'dustpylib.radtrans' and then sets __all__ for explicit export. There are no data processing, user input, or external communication operations. The structure is typical for a module that serves as a wrapper or interface layer. No suspicious activity or malicious code is present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign module re-exporting specific components from an external library. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, no embedded secrets, and no complex logic.",
