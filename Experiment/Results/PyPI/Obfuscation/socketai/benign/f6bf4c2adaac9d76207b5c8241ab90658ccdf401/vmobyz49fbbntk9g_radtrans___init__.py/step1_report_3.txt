{
  "purpose": "This code re-exports specific functions or modules ('radmc3d' and 'slab') from the 'dustpylib.radtrans' package, likely for ease of access or API design within a larger project.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'dustpylib.radtrans' indicating data or functionality being imported from an external package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or potential points where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks; no function calls or data handling beyond imports.",
  "flows": "No data or untrusted input flows are visible; the code only performs static imports and defines an export list.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior; the code is straightforward, only importing and exposing functions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific components from a third-party library and defines an __all__ list to control what is exported when the module is imported elsewhere. There are no functions, data handling, or dynamic code execution present. The code appears standard and benign, serving as a module wrapper or re-exporting specific functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module re-export with no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks detected. It is standard practice for organizing code modules.",
