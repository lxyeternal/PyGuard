{
  "purpose": "The code exports the 'gaps' submodule from the 'dustpylib.substructures' package.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'gaps' from 'dustpylib.substructures'",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external effects observed",
  "flows": "Import source to exported symbol; no data flow from external untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "Very minimal code; no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no unusual code constructs",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a specific submodule and declares it for export. There are no data inputs, outputs, or external network interactions. The structure is straightforward and typical for a Python package's __init__.py or module setup. No suspicious patterns, no hardcoded credentials, and no malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a module initializer or export statement without any malicious intent or security risks.",
