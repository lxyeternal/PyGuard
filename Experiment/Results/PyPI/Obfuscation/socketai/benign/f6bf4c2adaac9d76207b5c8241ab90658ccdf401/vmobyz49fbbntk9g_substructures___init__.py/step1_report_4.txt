  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "Import flows from 'dustpylib.substructures' to the module's namespace",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no suspicious or unusual patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a single symbol and declares it for public use. There are no input sources such as user input, environment variables, or network data. No data sinks are present. The structure and syntax are normal, with no obfuscation or hidden behavior. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module definition with a standard import and export declaration. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
