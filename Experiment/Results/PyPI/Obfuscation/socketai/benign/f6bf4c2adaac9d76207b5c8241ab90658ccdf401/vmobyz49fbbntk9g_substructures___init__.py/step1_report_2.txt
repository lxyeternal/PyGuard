  "purpose": "Define public interface for the module by exporting 'gaps' from 'dustpylib.substructures'.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'gaps' from an external library 'dustpylib.substructures'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data processing or output observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow beyond the import and export declarations.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, straightforward import-export pattern; no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a single item 'gaps' from a library 'dustpylib.substructures' and explicitly declares it as an export in __all__. There are no operations, data manipulations, or dynamic code execution. No credentials, network activity, or data leaks are present. The code appears to serve as a simple module interface definition.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a basic module stub that re-exports a component from an external library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
