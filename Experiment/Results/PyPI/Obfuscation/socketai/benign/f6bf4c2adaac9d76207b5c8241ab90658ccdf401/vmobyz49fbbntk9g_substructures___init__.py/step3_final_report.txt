  "purpose": "A minimal Python module that imports 'gaps' from 'dustpylib.substructures' and exposes it via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'gaps' from 'dustpylib.substructures'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external communication.",
  "flows": "Import of 'gaps' from the external library, then exposing it via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, static, and follows standard Python module practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import and export pattern with no dynamic code, data processing, or external communication. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified given the code's simplicity. Confidence is high (1) as the code's behavior is transparent and unambiguous. No vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident or assumed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module re-export with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
