{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that re-exports the 'gaps' substructure from the 'dustpylib.substructures' package, likely to be used elsewhere in a larger project.",
  "sources": "The code reads the import statement for 'dustpylib.substructures' and the '__all__' list defining module exports.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks that could lead to data leaks or security issues, as no untrusted data handling or sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "The import provides access to 'dustpylib.substructures.gaps', and the '__all__' list specifies 'gaps' as an export; no data flow or untrusted input handling is involved.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no anomalies such as obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific substructure 'gaps' from an external library 'dustpylib.substructures' and explicitly exports it via '__all__'. The structure suggests it's meant to be a simple re-export module. There are no dynamic operations, no data processing, and no evidence of malicious behavior. The code's simplicity indicates a standard practice for module organization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely as a re-export for the 'gaps' component from an external library. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks present.",
