{
  "purpose": "The code exports the 'gaps' component from the 'dustpylib.substructures' module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'dustpylib.substructures', and the '__all__' list defining exported symbols.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow involving untrusted input; static import and export declarations only.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific symbol 'gaps' from an external library 'dustpylib.substructures' and explicitly exposes it via '__all__'. There are no dynamic code executions, no data processing, nor external communications. It appears to be standard module export code, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple, standard, and contains no malicious or suspicious elements. It serves solely to re-export a component from an external library for use elsewhere.",
