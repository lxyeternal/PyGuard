{
  "purpose": "The code appears to import specific functions or classes from a module within the 'dustpylib' library and defines an export list.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'dustpylib.substructures.gaps.gaps' module.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; no external data output or sensitive data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; imports are static and do not process external data.",
  "anomalies": "Imported identifiers have obfuscated or nonsensical names (aCjUxMxnPcEoWBrUvLBeOEjMCHprNeJo, BkNMhfBGpVGmveIVxKPlFUHEnJbOGrOb), which may indicate obfuscation or malicious intent. No other suspicious activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific symbols from a module within a package and defines an explicit export list. The imported identifiers are obfuscated or non-descriptive, which could be a sign of obfuscation or malicious code hiding. There are no hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, or other malicious patterns. The code is minimal and does not perform any operations beyond imports and exports.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself does not contain malicious behavior but uses obfuscated identifiers, which could be a sign of attempted concealment. No immediate security risks are evident based solely on these imports and exports.",
