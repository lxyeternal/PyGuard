{
  "purpose": "Static import of obfuscated symbols with unrelated __all__ list, no active code or data flow.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing obfuscated symbols from a module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flow or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink flows; code only performs static imports and defines __all__.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated import names, unused imported symbols, __all__ list containing unrelated strings.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two symbols with non-descriptive, obfuscated names, which are not used elsewhere. The __all__ list contains unrelated string literals, indicating potential placeholder or obfuscated code. No data flows, network activity, or malicious patterns are present. The obfuscation may be for internal concealment or placeholder purposes but does not imply malicious intent. The lack of active code, data handling, or external interactions suggests benign behavior. The obfuscated identifiers and unrelated __all__ entries are typical in obfuscated or incomplete code snippets, with no evidence of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with obfuscated identifiers and no malicious behavior detected. The scores should reflect low malware and security risk, with obfuscation noted but not indicative of malicious intent.",
