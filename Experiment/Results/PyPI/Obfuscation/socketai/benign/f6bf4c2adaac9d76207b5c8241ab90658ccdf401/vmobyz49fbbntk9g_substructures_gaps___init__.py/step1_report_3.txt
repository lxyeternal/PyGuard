  "purpose": "The code appears to import specific functions or objects from a submodule within the 'dustpylib' package and defines an export list.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'dustpylib.substructures.gaps.gaps'",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no data or untrusted input handling is visible",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are observable in this snippet",
  "anomalies": "The imported identifiers ('aCjUxMxnPcEoWBrUvLBeOEjMCHprNeJo' and 'BkNMhfBGpVGmveIVxKPlFUHEnJbOGrOb') appear to be randomly named, potentially obfuscated or auto-generated. The import statements do not clarify their purpose or origin. The presence of only two identifiers with such naming could be suspicious if their purpose is unclear.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and straightforward, importing two objects from a module within 'dustpylib'. The identifiers are complex and obfuscated, which may suggest an attempt to hide their purpose, but this is not conclusive. The '__all__' list specifies string names, likely for module exports, unrelated to the imported identifiers. No malicious behavior such as network activity, data handling, or code execution is evident. The code's structure and content do not inherently indicate malicious intent but could be part of a larger, obfuscated or intentionally confusing codebase.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and does not display clear malicious activity. The obfuscated import names may suggest hidden functionality, but without additional context, this cannot be confirmed as malicious. No security risks are evident in this snippet.",
