{
  "purpose": "The code imports four symbols with obfuscated, non-descriptive names from a specific module and defines an __all__ list with standard function names, indicating an API exposure.",
  "sources": "Import statements reading symbols from 'dustpylib.radtrans.radmc3d.radmc3d' with obfuscated identifiers.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as data output, network transmission, or file operations are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The source is the import of obfuscated symbols; no further data flow is observable within this code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "Use of non-descriptive, seemingly random strings for imported symbols; potential obfuscation or concealment.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with obfuscated identifiers and an __all__ list. The suspicious naming pattern suggests possible obfuscation, which could be used to hide malicious functions or behavior. However, the snippet does not perform any malicious actions, data processing, or network activity. The high obfuscation score is justified due to the non-descriptive import names. The malware score remains low (0.2) because there is no evidence of malicious activity, but the suspicion warrants further investigation. The security risk score is moderate (around 0.3-0.4), reflecting concern over obfuscation without confirmed malicious intent. Overall, the code appears benign but suspicious in naming, requiring deeper source analysis to confirm safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code's obfuscated import names are suspicious and could conceal malicious functions, but no direct malicious activity is evident. The scores should reflect high suspicion of obfuscation (0.8), low likelihood of malware (0.2), and moderate security risk (0.3). Further source code review of the imported symbols is recommended to verify their purpose.",
