  "conclusion": "The code's obfuscated import names are suspicious and could conceal malicious functions, but no direct malicious activity is evident. The scores should reflect high suspicion of obfuscation (0.8), low likelihood of malware (0.2), and moderate security risk (0.3). Further source code review of the imported symbols is recommended to verify their purpose."
