  "purpose": "Import specific functions or classes from a module within the dustpylib library related to radiative transfer and specify exports.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing obfuscated symbols from dustpylib.radtrans.radmc3d.radmc3d",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or output functions are present; no untrusted data handling or external output observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only imports and defines __all__",
  "anomalies": "Imported symbols are named with non-descriptive, obfuscated identifiers, which is unusual and suspicious",
  "analysis": "The code imports three symbols with obfuscated names from a module, likely to conceal their purpose. These are not standard or descriptive names, raising suspicion. The __all__ list exposes certain functions or classes, which are clearly named and seem legitimate. No actual data processing, input, or output occurs in this snippet. The obfuscated imports suggest potential concealment, but on their own, they do not confirm malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code imports obfuscated symbols from a module and defines __all__ with standard-named functions. The obfuscated import names are suspicious as they conceal their purpose, which could be an attempt to hide malicious or undesirable behavior. However, without further context or code execution, no definitive malicious activity is evident. The overall risk appears low but warrants cautious review of the source module.",
