  "purpose": "Import specific functions from the dustpylib.radtrans.radmc3d.radmc3d module and define public interface variables.",

  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no data processing or output functions involved in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; imports are static references only.",
  "anomalies": "Imported identifiers are non-descriptive and appear to be randomly generated strings, which could suggest obfuscation or malicious intent, but may also be due to code generation or obfuscation techniques.",
  "analysis": "The code imports three functions with cryptic, nonsensical names from an internal module. The purpose of these functions cannot be determined from their names. The __all__ list defines public API exposure for 'Model', 'read_image', 'read_model', and 'read_spectrum', which seem standard for a modeling library. The random-looking function names could indicate obfuscation, but in the absence of other suspicious activity or context, they may also be placeholder or generated names. There are no explicit data leaks, code injection points, or malicious activities evident in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to perform standard import operations with obscure function names, which could suggest obfuscation. There is no direct evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this isolated fragment. The unusual identifiers warrant further review of the entire package for malicious intent, but based solely on this snippet, it does not appear malicious.",
