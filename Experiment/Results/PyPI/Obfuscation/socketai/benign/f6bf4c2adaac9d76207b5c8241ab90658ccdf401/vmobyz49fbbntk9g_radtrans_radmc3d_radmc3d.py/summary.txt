  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated but legitimate utility for astrophysical dust radiative transfer setup. No evidence of malware or malicious activity is found. The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not imply malicious intent. The low malware score (around 0.15) and moderate risk score (around 0.3) are justified based on the analysis."
