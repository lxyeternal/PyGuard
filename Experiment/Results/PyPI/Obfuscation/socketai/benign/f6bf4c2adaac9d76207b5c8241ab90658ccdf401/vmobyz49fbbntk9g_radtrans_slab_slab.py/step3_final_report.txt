  "purpose": "Scientific modeling functions related to dust radiative transfer, dielectric properties, and optical calculations in astrophysics.",
  "sources": "Variables and constants are set internally; no external data reads or network interactions are evident.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data exfiltration points; no malicious code or external system manipulation detected.",
  "flows": "Mathematical operations and interpolations operate on input parameters and internal constants; no malicious data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of variable names and verbose, nonsensical comments; no malicious payloads or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs physics-based calculations typical in astrophysical modeling, with obfuscated variable names likely for proprietary or complexity reasons. No network, file I/O, or malicious system access is present. The constants are physical constants, and functions execute standard scientific computations. Comments are corrupted or nonsensical, but this does not imply malicious intent. The obfuscation level is high, but it is consistent with scientific or proprietary code rather than malware. No signs of backdoors, data leaks, or malicious payloads are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate scientific modeling module with heavy obfuscation but no evidence of malicious behavior or security threats. The obfuscation appears intentional for proprietary reasons, not malicious sabotage.",
