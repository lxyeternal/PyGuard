{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class inheriting from DAO that provides static data: a string 'pws' and a resource directory path relative to the current file.",
  "sources": "The class methods do not read external input; they generate static strings and paths based on __file__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed; no external communication or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "The methods return static data without processing untrusted sources; no data flows from input to output.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated class and method names; static string 'pws' which could be suspicious but is benign here.",
  "analysis": "The code is heavily obfuscated but performs simple static operations: returning a fixed string and constructing a resource path. There is no network activity, data processing, or dynamic code execution. The obfuscation may be stylistic or concealment but does not imply malicious intent. The static string 'pws' is not evidence of malicious behavior. The resource path construction is standard. The lack of input handling or external communication indicates benign behavior. The obfuscation warrants caution but is not inherently malicious. The malware score is 0, the obfuscation score is high (~0.8), and the security risk score is low (~0.2).",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with obfuscation but no malicious activity or security risks evident. The scores are justified and should remain as is unless further code reveals malicious intent.",
