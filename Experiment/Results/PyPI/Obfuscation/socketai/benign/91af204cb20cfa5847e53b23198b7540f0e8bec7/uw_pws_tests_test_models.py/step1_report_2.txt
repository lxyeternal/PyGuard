  "purpose": "Unit tests for models related to user and employee data, likely for validating data processing functions.",
  "sources": "Data is read from hardcoded dictionaries within test methods, and from imported classes and methods.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks found; no data is written or transmitted to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Data flows from hardcoded inputs into model instances and methods that generate or retrieve structured data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, no hardcoded credentials or secrets, no obfuscated code. The code uses typical testing patterns with no unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple unit tests that instantiate classes from the 'uw_pws.models' module. These tests verify that data processing methods return expected structured dictionaries and object attributes. The data appears to be mock data for users and employees, with no signs of malicious intent or data leakage. There are no external network calls, no file operations, and no dynamic code execution. All inputs are static, and output validation is straightforward. The code is structured for testing correctness rather than malicious activity. Overall, there are no anomalies or security concerns identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard unit test suite verifying data processing functions for user and employee models. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code is well-structured for testing purposes with no suspicious or malicious patterns.",
