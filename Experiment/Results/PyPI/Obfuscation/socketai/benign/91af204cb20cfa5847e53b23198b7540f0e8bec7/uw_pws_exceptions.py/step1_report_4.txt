  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for potential error handling or categorization.",
  "sources": "No external data input; classes are defined statically.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or external communication occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow; class definitions do not process data or perform actions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of nonsensical, obfuscated class names; no functional code or logic; no apparent purpose other than obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code only defines four custom exception classes with obscure, seemingly random names. There are no functions, no data input, no external interactions. The purpose appears solely to obfuscate or hide intent, potentially to evade detection or analysis. No malicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious code execution is present. No suspicious patterns, code injection, or malware indicators are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists solely of class declarations with obfuscated names, serving no functional purpose other than obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks in this fragment.",
