{
  "purpose": "Define multiple custom exception classes with obfuscated names",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines classes without external input",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or output occurs",
  "flows": "No data flow; class definitions are static and do not process input",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated class names, which could be an attempt to hide intent or avoid detection",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of four custom exception class definitions with intentionally obfuscated class names. There are no functions, data processing, or external interactions. The obfuscation could be used to hide malicious intent or simply to make reverse engineering more difficult. However, without additional code or context, these class definitions by themselves are benign. The code does not perform any malicious actions such as data exfiltration, network activity, or system modification.",
  "conclusion": "The code only defines obfuscated custom exception classes and shows no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in isolation. The obfuscation may be suspicious but is not necessarily malicious without further context.",
