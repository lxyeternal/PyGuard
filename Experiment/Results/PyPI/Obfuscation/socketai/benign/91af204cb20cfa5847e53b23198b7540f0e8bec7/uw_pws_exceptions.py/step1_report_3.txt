  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error conditions",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; class definitions are static",
  "sinks": "No data output or untrusted data handling; only class declarations",
  "flows": "No data flow, no source-to-sink paths present",
  "anomalies": "Class names are nonsensical and obfuscated, with no meaningful identifiers; no documentation or comments; no indication of intentional or benign purpose",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of four custom exception class definitions with obfuscated names. These classes inherit from the Exception base class but contain no additional logic or attributes. The naming pattern appears intentionally obscure, which could be a sign of hiding malicious intent or simply obfuscation. There are no external data sources, no runtime operations, and no apparent interaction with other code or data. The code is minimal and static, with no suspicious behavior detected within this fragment. Since there are no inputs, outputs, or executable flows, the code alone does not exhibit malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code only defines obfuscated custom exception classes with no active behavior or malicious indicators. The obscure naming could be benign or designed to hide malicious intent, but based solely on this fragment, there is no evidence of malware or security risk.",
