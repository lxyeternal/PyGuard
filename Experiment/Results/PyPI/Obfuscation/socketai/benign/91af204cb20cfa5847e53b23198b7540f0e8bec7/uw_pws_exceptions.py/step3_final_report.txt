{
  "purpose": "Defines multiple custom exception classes with obfuscated names, likely for use in exception handling within a larger application.",
  "sources": "Class definitions; no input/output, data processing, or external data sources present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; code does not process or output data, nor does it interact with external systems.",
  "flows": "No runtime flows; static class declarations with no execution logic or data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of class names, which could be used to conceal intent; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of four custom exception classes with obfuscated names, with no logic, data handling, or external communication. The obfuscation is high, which may be suspicious but is not inherently malicious. The malware score is zero, reflecting no malicious behavior. The security risk score is low, as the code is static and benign. The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not indicate active threats. The scores across reports are consistent and justified based on the evidence.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with obfuscation being the primary notable aspect. No malicious activity or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned are appropriate; malware is zero, obfuscation is high, and security risk is minimal. Continued monitoring is advised if part of a larger codebase, but in isolation, the code poses no threat.",
