{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package, reading version info from an external file and configuring package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from an external file, path manipulations using os module, environment variables not used.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, no network activity, no data leaks or malicious code execution.",
  "flows": "Reading version info from file, setting package data, no external data flow to network or system modifications.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; invalid attribute access `os.yKQcDGAnUxBRIqvzixPNgwDnEHWAOCkQ` suggests obfuscation or corruption.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical setup tasks with obfuscated variable names, likely to conceal intent. The invalid attribute access indicates obfuscation or code corruption, which is suspicious. No network activity or malicious behavior is evident. The obfuscation is superficial but may hinder analysis. The code relies on external files, which could be tampered with, but this is common in setup scripts. Overall, no active malicious behavior detected, but the suspicious code warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script with obfuscation. The invalid attribute access in the obfuscated code suggests potential obfuscation or corruption, raising suspicion but not confirming malicious intent. The overall security risk is low, but the obfuscation and suspicious code pattern should be monitored.",
