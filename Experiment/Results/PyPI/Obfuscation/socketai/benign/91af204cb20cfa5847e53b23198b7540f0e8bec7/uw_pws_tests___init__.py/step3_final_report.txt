  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code snippets, data flows, input points, and code structure within the package.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network connections, or execution points where untrusted data could cause harm.",
  "flows": "Data from sources to sinks, including any code execution paths or data exfiltration channels.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, unusual code patterns, or obfuscation techniques.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets are either benign, minimal, or empty, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious indicators. Confidence levels are appropriate given the limited context. No evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation is detected. Risk scores are conservative but justified; however, given the benign nature, they can be lowered. The absence of code or suspicious patterns supports a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a low security risk score around 0.1 to 0.2.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, with no malicious or obfuscated elements detected. The current scores are appropriate, though the security risk could be slightly reduced to reflect the benign assessment. Overall, the supply chain security posture of this dependency is sound.",
