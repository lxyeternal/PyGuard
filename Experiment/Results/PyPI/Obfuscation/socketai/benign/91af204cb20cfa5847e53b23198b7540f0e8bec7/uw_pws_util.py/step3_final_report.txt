  "purpose": "Configure a mock class for REST clients using an override_settings function, likely for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement from commonconf and assignment to an obfuscated variable name.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, network activity, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Import -> override_settings -> variable assignment; no external data flow or malicious sink identified.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable name, which is suspicious but common in testing or auto-generated code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a configuration override function and assigns its result to a variable with a nonsensical name. This pattern is typical in test setups to mock or override settings. No malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code injection is evident. The obfuscated variable name raises suspicion but is consistent with testing or auto-generated code. The malware score is correctly set to 0, and the low security risk score reflects the benign nature of the code. The obfuscation score is moderate, justified by the variable name. Confidence in these conclusions is high given the context.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard test configuration snippet that sets a mock class for REST clients. Despite the suspicious variable name, there is no evidence of malicious activity or security risk. The current scores are appropriate; malware is 0, obfuscation is moderate (~0.6), and risk is low (~0.2).",
