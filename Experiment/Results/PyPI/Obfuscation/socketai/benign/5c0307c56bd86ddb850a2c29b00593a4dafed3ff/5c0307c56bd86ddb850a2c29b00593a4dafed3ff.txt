      "obfuscated": 0.6,
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code appears benign, functioning as a simple wrapper around an external charting function with lazy import. There is no evidence of malware, malicious behavior, or active sabotage. The main concern is the potential misuse if 'price_historical' mishandles untrusted input, but this is outside the scope of this snippet. The obfuscation is minimal and likely stylistic. Overall, the code is low risk and safe for use, with scores aligned to its characteristics."

      "obfuscated": 0.8,
      "confidence": 0.85,
      "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with low security risks. Report 4's obfuscation and dynamic behavior justify higher scores, indicating potential malicious intent. Overall, the dependency is low risk, but further code review of suspicious segments is recommended."

      "obfuscated": 0.65,
      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code is likely part of a legitimate API for crypto data, with obfuscation as the main concern. No evidence of malware or malicious behavior is present. The current scores should reflect low malware risk, moderate obfuscation, and moderate security concern due to dynamic data handling."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation for a crypto data retrieval command with superficial obfuscation. No malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities are detected. The use of locals() warrants caution but does not currently indicate a threat. Overall, the code is safe with minimal security risk."

Report 1's suspicion warrants a slightly higher malware score, but current scores are acceptable. The other reports correctly reflect benign code. No significant issues or false positives are identified."
