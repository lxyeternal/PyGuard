{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class with a static method that dynamically imports and calls a function from an external module, returning its result.",
  "sources": "The code reads input through the **kwargs parameter passed to the static method.",
  "sinks": "The imported function 'price_historical' is called with **kwargs, which could potentially lead to code injection or unintended behavior if untrusted input is passed.",
  "flows": "Input data via **kwargs flows into the 'price_historical' function, which may process or execute it.",
  "anomalies": "The class and method names are obfuscated, which can be suspicious. The dynamic import within the method is unusual but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code uses type hinting and conditional imports for type checking, which is standard. The static method performs a dynamic import and calls an external function with flexible parameters. This design could be used to hide malicious behavior, but there is no direct evidence of malicious intent in this snippet. The obfuscated class and method names might indicate an attempt to conceal purpose, but could also be a coding style. Overall, the code appears to be a simple wrapper around an external function, with no clear malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not demonstrate malicious behavior; it seems to be a straightforward dynamic import and function call with obfuscated identifiers. No malicious intent or security risks are evident from this fragment alone.",
