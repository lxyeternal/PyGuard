{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class with a static method that imports and calls a function from an external charting library, likely for generating historical price charts.",
  "sources": "The code reads type hints and performs an import within a method, specifically 'from openbb_charting.charts.price_historical import price_historical'.",
  "sinks": "The imported function 'price_historical' is called with kwargs, which could potentially process untrusted data if inputs are not validated elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Input data via **kwargs flows into 'price_historical' function; no explicit data validation or sanitization is shown.",
  "anomalies": "The dynamic import within the method might be unusual but not inherently malicious; class name and method names appear obfuscated or auto-generated. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a class with a static method that imports and invokes an external function. The import occurs within the method, which could be for lazy loading but is not suspicious per se. The class name and method name appear obfuscated, possibly to hinder straightforward understanding. The imported 'price_historical' function is invoked with kwargs, which, depending on context, could be a source of untrusted data. No code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is apparent. There are no signs of backdoors, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate wrapper around an external charting function, with obfuscated naming but no evident malicious intent or security risks. The only minor concern is the dynamic import pattern, which is common in plugin architectures but not malicious. Overall, it is low risk.",
