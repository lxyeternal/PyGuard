  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, functioning as a simple wrapper around an external charting function with lazy import. There is no evidence of malware, malicious behavior, or active sabotage. The main concern is the potential misuse if 'price_historical' mishandles untrusted input, but this is outside the scope of this snippet. The obfuscation is minimal and likely stylistic. Overall, the code is low risk and safe for use, with scores aligned to its characteristics."
