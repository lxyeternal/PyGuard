  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Defines a class with a static method.\n- The method performs a dynamic import of `price_historical` from `openbb_charting.charts.price_historical`.\n- Calls `price_historical(**kwargs)` and returns its output.\n- Uses type hints and conditional `TYPE_CHECKING` import for type annotations.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Benign wrapper for plotting function.\n- **Sources:** Reads from `price_historical`.\n- **Sinks:** Passes `**kwargs` to the function; no direct data sink.\n- **Flows:** Data flows into `price_historical`.\n- **Anomalies:** None observed.\n- **Analysis:** Standard pattern, no malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, low risk.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- **malware:** 0 (appropriate)  \n- **securityRisk:** 0.1 (low, justified)  \n- **obfuscated:** 0 (not obfuscated)  \n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar wrapper.\n- **Sources:** Same import and kwargs.\n- **Sinks:** Same potential passing of untrusted data.\n- **Anomalies:** Dynamic import standard for optional dependencies.\n- **Analysis:** No evidence of malicious intent; the dynamic import could be a concern but is common.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- **malware:** 0 (appropriate)  \n- **securityRisk:** 0.2 (slightly higher, but still justified given dynamic import and untrusted data flow)  \n- **obfuscated:** 0 (not obfuscated)\n\n**Verdict:** Acceptable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Sources:** Same.\n- **Sinks:** Same.\n- **Anomalies:** Obfuscated class/method names, which could be suspicious.\n- **Analysis:** Obfuscation may be suspicious but does not imply maliciousness. No direct evidence.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- **malware:** 0 (appropriate)  \n- **obfuscated:** 0.8 (high, justified due to naming)  \n- **securityRisk:** 0.2 (acceptable)\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Sources:** Same.\n- **Sinks:** Same.\n- **Anomalies:** Obfuscated names, dynamic import.\n- **Analysis:** Similar reasoning; obfuscation could be a concern but not malicious.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- **malware:** 0 (appropriate)  \n- **obfuscated:** 0.7 (justified)  \n- **securityRisk:** 0.2\n\n**Verdict:** Acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Same.\n- **Sources:** Same.\n- **Sinks:** Same.\n- **Anomalies:** No, similar to previous.\n- **Analysis:** Standard pattern, no malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- **malware:** 0  \n- **obfuscated:** 0  \n- **securityRisk:** 0.2 (consistent with previous reports)\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment & Recommendations**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** Some reports assign high obfuscation scores due to naming; this seems justified given the class/method names appear auto-generated or intentionally obscure.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly higher in some reports (0.2) due to dynamic import and untrusted data flow, which is acceptable.\n\n**Potential Adjustments:**\n- Since the code relies on external functions that could process untrusted data, a **security risk score of 0.2** seems reasonable across reports.\n- The **malware score** should remain at **0** as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- The **obfuscation score** could be slightly lowered if the naming is deemed not suspicious, but given the pattern, it's acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Justified Scores (from my review):**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Security Risk |\n|---------|---------|--------------|--------------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0.1          |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0.2          |\n| 3       | 0       | 0.8          | 0.2          |\n| 4       | 0       | 0.7          | 0.2          |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0.2          |\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code appears benign, with dynamic import patterns and untrusted data flow being standard in plugin architectures. The obfuscation is the only notable aspect, but it doesn't imply malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's characteristics.\n\n**Final note:** No evidence suggests malware or malicious intent; the risk is low but warrants standard caution due to dynamic import and data flow.",
