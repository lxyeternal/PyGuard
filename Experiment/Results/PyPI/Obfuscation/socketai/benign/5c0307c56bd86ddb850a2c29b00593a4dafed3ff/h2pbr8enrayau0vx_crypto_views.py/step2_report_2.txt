  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Defines a class with a static method.\n- Inside the method, performs a dynamic import of `price_historical`.\n- Calls `price_historical(**kwargs)` and returns its output.\n- Uses type hints and conditional import for type checking.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are evident.\n- The import within the method suggests modular design, possibly for lazy loading.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code does **not** contain any malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- The `price_historical` function is invoked with user-provided `**kwargs`, which could be untrusted input, but this is typical for such wrapper functions.\n- No data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors are present.\n- The dynamic import pattern is common in plugin architectures, not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Correctly describes the class and static method wrapping an external function.\n- **Analysis:** Finds no anomalies, no malicious behavior, and notes the dynamic import for modularity.\n- **Score:** Malware = 0, Security risk = 0.1, Confidence = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable. The low security risk score aligns with the benign nature.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, describes the dynamic import and invocation.\n- **Analysis:** Also notes no suspicious code, with standard design.\n- **Score:** Malware = 0, Security risk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher security risk score, but still reasonable given the code. No malicious activity detected.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Highlights obfuscated class/method names and dynamic import.\n- **Analysis:** Recognizes obfuscation as potentially suspicious but finds no evidence of malicious intent.\n- **Score:** Malware = 0, Security risk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.7.\n- **Assessment:** The obfuscation could be a concern, but without evidence, the low malware score remains justified.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to others, notes dynamic import and passing untrusted data.\n- **Analysis:** Considers the obfuscated naming but finds no malicious behavior.\n- **Score:** Malware = 0, Security risk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.8.\n- **Assessment:** The pattern is typical for plugin systems; no issues.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Repeats similar points.\n- **Analysis:** Finds no malicious activity, notes the dynamic import.\n- **Score:** Malware = 0, Security risk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with other reports.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Slightly higher in some reports due to obfuscated class/method names, which is reasonable.\n- **Risk score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2) is justified, considering the dynamic import of external code with untrusted parameters, but overall low risk.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.6 — moderate obfuscation (class and method names are non-descriptive), but not necessarily malicious.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — low, primarily due to dynamic import and untrusted input passing, but no actual malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Final Notes:\n- The dynamic import pattern is common in plugin architectures; unless the external module is compromised, it is not inherently risky.\n- The code's behavior depends on the external `price_historical` function, but based on this snippet alone, it appears benign.\n- No signs of obfuscation hiding malicious intent, just possibly auto-generated or placeholder names.\n\n**Conclusion:** The current scores are appropriate. I would maintain the malware score at 0, obfuscated at around 0.6, and risk at 0.2, reflecting the low but non-zero potential surface for issues due to dynamic import and untrusted input.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No significant changes needed; the code appears safe and the scores are reasonable.",
