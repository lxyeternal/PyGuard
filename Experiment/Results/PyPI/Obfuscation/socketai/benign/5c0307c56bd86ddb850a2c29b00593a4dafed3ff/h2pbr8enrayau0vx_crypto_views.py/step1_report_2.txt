{
  "purpose": "Defines a class with a static method that imports and calls a function from an external charting module, returning its output.",
  "sources": "Import statement within the static method: 'from openbb_charting.charts.price_historical import price_historical'. The method's parameters via **kwargs.",
  "sinks": "The imported 'price_historical' function is invoked with **kwargs, potentially passing untrusted data from outside sources to the function.",
  "flows": "Untrusted **kwargs passed to the static method are forwarded directly to 'price_historical', which may process or execute code based on input.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional import using TYPE_CHECKING is standard for type hints; dynamic import inside the method is typical for optional dependencies. No suspicious code or hidden backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with a static method that imports 'price_historical' from a charting module only when called, passing user-supplied keyword arguments directly to it. The import occurs within the method, which could be for lazy loading or optional dependency management. There are no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no signs of malicious payloads. The use of dynamic import could be a potential surface for malicious code if the module itself were compromised, but within this snippet, there is no evidence of malicious intent. The method's purpose appears to be to facilitate plotting or data retrieval from an external source.\n\nNo anomalous or malicious code patterns, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present in this snippet. The import and function call are standard for a plugin or modular design.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, non-malicious component of a larger system, designed to import and invoke a charting function dynamically. There is no evidence of malware or security risks within this fragment.",
