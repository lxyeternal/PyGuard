{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class with a static method that imports and calls an external function to generate a historical price chart figure.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the module 'openbb_charting.charts.price_historical' during the method execution.",
  "sinks": "The imported function 'price_historical' may process **kwargs which could include untrusted data; however, there are no direct data sinks like network or file I/O in this code.",
  "flows": "Input data via **kwargs flows into 'price_historical' function, which then outputs a tuple containing a figure object and a dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The class and method are straightforward, with lazy import within a method to avoid circular dependencies. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a class with a static method that dynamically imports a plotting function from an external module and executes it with arbitrary keyword arguments. The import inside the method suggests modular design but does not introduce malicious behavior. No suspicious or malicious code behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors, is present. The code appears to be a standard wrapper for invoking a plotting function with provided parameters.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, seemingly benign wrapper around a charting function, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It uses dynamic import for modularity and does not handle sensitive data insecurely.",
