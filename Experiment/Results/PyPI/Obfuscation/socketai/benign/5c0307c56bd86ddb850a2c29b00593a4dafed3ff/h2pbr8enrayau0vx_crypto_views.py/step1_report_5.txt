{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class with a static method that dynamically imports and calls a function from an external module to generate a historical price chart.",
  "sources": "The import statement within the method: 'from openbb_charting.charts.price_historical import price_historical' and the method's **kwargs input that is passed to this function.",
  "sinks": "The call to 'price_historical(**kwargs)' which may process untrusted input data, potentially leading to security issues if 'price_historical' does not properly validate input.",
  "flows": "Input data via **kwargs flows into the 'price_historical' function, which is imported at runtime; this could be exploited if 'price_historical' improperly handles untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import within a method, which may obscure code flow but is a common pattern in plugin-like architectures; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with a static method that imports a specific function from an external module only when called. The method then invokes this function, passing through any provided keyword arguments. This approach defers the import to runtime, possibly for modularity or lazy loading. There are no signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The import is within a function, which is a standard pattern for optional or delayed imports. No suspicious anomalies or hardcoded secrets are present. The code’s behavior depends on the external 'price_historical' function, but based solely on this fragment, it appears to be a typical dynamic import pattern.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward class and method that performs a dynamic import and call to an external function, likely for generating a chart. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks in this fragment. The design is standard for modular code. Overall, it appears benign.",
