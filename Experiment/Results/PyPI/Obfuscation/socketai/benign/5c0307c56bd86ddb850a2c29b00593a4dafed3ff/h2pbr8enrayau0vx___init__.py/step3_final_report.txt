{
  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code structure, obfuscation, and suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Any code input, especially dynamic code execution, network calls, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated segments.",
  "sinks": "Potential data exfiltration points, network connections, eval()/exec() calls, file modifications, or environment variable access.",
  "flows": "From code input or dynamic execution points to data transmission, file system, or environment modifications.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation, use of eval()/exec(), dynamic imports, complex control flow, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits typical benign patterns in most reports, with low malware and obfuscation scores. Report 4 indicates obfuscation and dynamic code execution, justifying higher malware (0.6) and obfuscation (0.8) scores. Other reports align with their low-risk assessments. The overall pattern suggests most code is safe, with a notable exception in report 4. Scores are consistent with descriptions, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with low security risks. Report 4's obfuscation and dynamic behavior justify higher scores, indicating potential malicious intent. Overall, the dependency is low risk, but further code review of suspicious segments is recommended.",
