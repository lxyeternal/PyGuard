  "purpose": "Define a router command for retrieving historical cryptocurrency data from various providers.",
  "sources": "import statements, decorator parameters, APIEx instances with configuration data",
  "sinks": "The 'Query' object created with local variables, passing data to OBBject.from_query()",
  "flows": "Input data from APIEx instances flows into the Query object, which is then used in from_query()",
  "anomalies": "Use of seemingly obfuscated variable names; the code structure appears deliberately complex but does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or credentials observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several modules, defines a router with a command 'CryptoHistorical', and creates multiple APIEx objects containing configuration data such as symbols, date ranges, and providers. These configurations are passed into a Query object, which is then processed by OBBject.from_query(). The code does not contain suspicious network calls, file operations, or code injections. Variable names are obfuscated but do not inherently suggest malicious activity. No hardcoded credentials or secret keys are evident. The overall structure indicates a standard data retrieval setup for a cryptocurrency data API, with parameters safely contained within data objects. The use of obfuscated variable names might be for code obfuscation or simply to avoid naming conflicts but does not imply malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical implementation of a command for retrieving cryptocurrency data with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscated variable names are a concern but do not necessarily point to malicious activity. Overall, the code is likely safe, serving a data-fetching function.",
