  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code snippets are heavily obfuscated, with variable and class names like `grMfIyGdPCXYDjlvDYBVdBpytJPTTjON`, `trqBHeVdizYZkXyBuufPMSLSeQvUuqrt`, and `OBBject`. Such obfuscation is suspicious and warrants caution.\n- The code appears to be part of an API routing framework, defining a command `CryptoSearch` that queries cryptocurrency data.\n- The core logic involves creating a `Query` object from local variables and passing it to `OBBject.from_query()`.\n- No explicit malicious code (e.g., network calls, file operations, command execution) is visible.\n- The reports generally conclude that there is no malicious intent, but they note the obfuscation as a potential concern.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code functions as a standard API command setup, with no evident security flaws or malicious behavior.\n- The obfuscation of variable and class names is unusual and could be an attempt to hide intent, which is suspicious but not conclusive of malicious activity.\n- The use of `locals()` to gather all local variables into the `Query` could potentially include unintended data, but without the implementation details of `Query` and `OBBject`, this remains speculative.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- The import statement `from openbb_core.app.model.obbject import OBBject` appears misspelled (`obbject` instead of `object`), which could be a typo or an intentional obfuscation.\n- The use of heavily obfuscated names reduces code readability and maintainability, which is a poor practice unless justified.\n- Relying on `locals()` for query construction can be risky if unintended variables are included, but this depends on the implementation of `Query`.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0 or very low (0.2). Given the code, no malware is evident. The obfuscation alone does not imply malware.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Ranges from 0.6 to 0.7, which seems reasonable considering the variable names.\n- **Risk score:** Ranges from 0.2 to 0.4, reflecting moderate concern due to obfuscation and dynamic query construction.\n\n**Recommendation:** The scores seem consistent with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary unless further context reveals malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for higher risk or malware scores:\n- The obfuscation of variable names and class names is a red flag, but not definitive.\n- The use of `locals()` to assemble query parameters could be exploited if the underlying `Query` or `OBBject` implementations are insecure, but this cannot be confirmed here.\n- No evidence of malicious activity (e.g., network calls, data exfiltration, code injection) is present.\n\n### Potential assumptions:\n- The reports assume that obfuscation is suspicious but do not assume malicious intent unless further evidence is provided.\n- The assumption that `from_query()` or `from_query()` could be malicious is not justified without source code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated score:** ~0.65 (moderate obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** ~0.3 (moderate concern due to obfuscation and dynamic query construction)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code appears to implement a standard command for a crypto data API, with obfuscation that warrants caution but no direct malicious activity. The scores assigned by the reports are reasonable, and I agree with them.\n\n**Further action:** If possible, review the implementations of `Query`, `OBBject`, and the overall framework to ensure they handle untrusted input securely and do not perform unsafe operations.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Maintain the current scores but flag the obfuscation as a potential concern.\n- No immediate malware risk; the primary concern is code maintainability and potential concealment.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you'd like a detailed review of the underlying components or further analysis.",
