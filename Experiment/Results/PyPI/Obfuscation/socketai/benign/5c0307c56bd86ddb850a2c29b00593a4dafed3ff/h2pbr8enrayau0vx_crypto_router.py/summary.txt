  "malware_score": 0,
  "security_risk": 0.3,

  "confidence": 0.75,
  "conclusion": "The code is likely part of a legitimate API for crypto data, with obfuscation as the main concern. No evidence of malware or malicious behavior is present. The current scores should reflect low malware risk, moderate obfuscation, and moderate security concern due to dynamic data handling."
