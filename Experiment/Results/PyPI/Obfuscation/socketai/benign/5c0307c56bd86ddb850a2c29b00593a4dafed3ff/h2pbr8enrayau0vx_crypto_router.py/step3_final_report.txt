{
  "purpose": "Defines a cryptocurrency data router with a command 'CryptoSearch' that executes a query based on provided parameters.",
  "sources": "Imports from openbb_core modules, router inclusion, command decorator, local variables in function scope.",
  "sinks": "The code constructs a Query object from local variables and passes it to OBBject.from_query, which could be a sink if it processes untrusted data insecurely.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> local variables -> Query(**locals()) -> OBBject.from_query() -> return object",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of variable and class names, misspelled import ('obbject'), use of locals() for query data, no explicit validation or sanitization shown.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a router with a command for cryptocurrency data retrieval, using obfuscated identifiers. No direct malicious activity (network calls, file operations, code injection) is visible. The obfuscation raises suspicion but is not conclusive of malicious intent. The use of locals() to generate a query could be risky if 'from_query' mishandles untrusted data, but implementation details are unavailable. The import misspelling may be benign or malicious. Overall, the code appears standard but obfuscated, warranting further review of 'from_query' and related components.",
  "conclusion": "The code is likely part of a legitimate API for crypto data, with obfuscation as the main concern. No evidence of malware or malicious behavior is present. The current scores should reflect low malware risk, moderate obfuscation, and moderate security concern due to dynamic data handling.",
