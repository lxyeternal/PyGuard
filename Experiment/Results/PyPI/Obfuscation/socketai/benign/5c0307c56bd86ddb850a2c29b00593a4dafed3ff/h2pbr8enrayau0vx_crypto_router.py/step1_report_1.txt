  "purpose": "Define a router for cryptocurrency market data queries with a specific command to search for crypto data.",
  "sources": "Import statements, assignment of router, inclusion of sub-router, decorator for command, and function parameters.",
  "sinks": "Query construction via locals(), passing data to OBBject.from_query, and potential data handling within from_query.",
  "flows": "Inputs from APIEx instances and command parameters flow into the Query, then into OBBject.from_query.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names, no hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code segments; the code appears structured and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various modules, creates a router with a descriptive prefix, includes a sub-router, and defines a command 'CryptoSearch' with associated parameters. The command handler function asynchronously creates a Query object from local variables and returns an OBBject generated from that query. The variable names are obfuscated but used consistently; no insecure practices or malicious patterns are evident. The data flow appears standard for a command-based API module, with no signs of data leaks, code injection, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to implement a standard API command for cryptocurrency data retrieval without malicious intent. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident based on the provided code. The obfuscated variable names suggest deliberate concealment, but they do not indicate malicious activity per se.",
