  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, the code, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Code**: `from .app import *; from .schema import *`\n- **Findings**: The report correctly notes that this is a simple import statement from local modules. No data processing, network activity, or execution is involved.\n- **Malware & Security Risk**: Both scores are 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated**: 0, which is correct.\n- **Comments**: The primary concern is maintainability due to wildcard imports, not security. The report's reasoning is sound.\n\n**Verdict**: No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Code**: Same as above.\n- **Findings**: Same as report 1, with emphasis on namespace pollution but no malicious activity.\n- **Scores**: Malware 0, securityRisk 0.2, which is reasonable given the poor practice but no security threat.\n- **Obfuscated**: 0, appropriate.\n\n**Verdict**: No issues. The reasoning and scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Code**: Same pattern.\n- **Findings**: The analysis correctly states that importing all symbols does not imply malicious activity.\n- **Scores**: Malware 0, securityRisk 0.1, which seems appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated**: 0, correct.\n\n**Verdict**: No issues. The assessment is sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Code**: Same import pattern.\n- **Findings**: Correctly notes that wildcard imports are bad practice but not malicious.\n- **Scores**: Malware 0, securityRisk 0.2, aligns with the reasoning.\n- **Obfuscated**: 0, correct.\n\n**Verdict**: No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Code**: Same pattern.\n- **Findings**: Consistent with previous reports, noting potential for obscuring malicious code but no evidence here.\n- **Scores**: Malware 0, securityRisk 0.2, appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated**: 0, consistent.\n\n**Verdict**: No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code only contains import statements with no malicious activity.\n- The use of wildcard imports is a concern for maintainability but not security.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or active vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score**: 0 for all, since no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score**: Given the lack of any actual security threat, a low risk score (around 0.1 to 0.2) is appropriate.\n\n**Additional notes**:\n\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Overall conclusion**: The code snippet is benign, with only a stylistic concern regarding wildcard imports. The scores reflect this accurately.\n\n**My recommended scores**:\n\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0.1 (since wildcard imports can cause maintainability issues but do not pose security threats)\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
