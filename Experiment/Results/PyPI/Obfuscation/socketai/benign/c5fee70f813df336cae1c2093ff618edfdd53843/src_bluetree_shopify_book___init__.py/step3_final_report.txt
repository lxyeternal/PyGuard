{
  "purpose": "This code imports all symbols from local modules 'app' and 'schema' using wildcard imports.",
  "sources": "Import statements from .app and .schema modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present; no data leaks or external communications.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only static import statements.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports ('*'), which can obscure imported symbols and reduce code clarity; no malicious or suspicious code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules, with no data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The wildcard imports are a stylistic concern but do not constitute security risks. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's benign nature. Without inspecting the contents of 'app' and 'schema', no malicious intent can be confirmed, but based on this snippet alone, the code is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with only a maintainability concern regarding wildcard imports. No evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities is present.",
