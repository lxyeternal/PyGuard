  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the actual code snippet:\n\n```python\nfrom .app import *\nfrom .schema import *\n```\n\n**Confirmation of issues:**\n- The code only contains two import statements with wildcard imports from local modules. There are no signs of data processing, network activity, or code execution.\n- The report's assessments that no malicious activity is present are accurate.\n- The main concern highlighted is the use of wildcard imports, which can obscure what symbols are imported and potentially lead to namespace pollution or unintended behaviors. This is a valid coding style concern but not a security issue.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is only performing static imports and does not process untrusted data.\n- They uniformly state that no malicious activity is evident, which is accurate.\n- The reports mention the use of wildcard imports as a stylistic or maintainability concern, which is appropriate.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- Security risk scores are low (mostly around 0.1–0.2), which seems reasonable given the minimal code.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the code being straightforward.\n- Confidence levels vary from 0.4 to 0.9, reflecting differing degrees of certainty but generally acknowledging the benign nature.\n\n**Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n- None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.2, which is appropriate.\n- The highest confidence is 0.9 with a risk score of 0.1, which is justified.\n\n**Malware score considerations:**\n- Since the code only imports modules and does not execute or process data, malware scores should remain at 0.\n- If the imported modules ('app' and 'schema') contained malicious code, that could be a concern, but this cannot be inferred from the import statements alone.\n\n**Claims based on assumptions:**\n- No report makes unwarranted assumptions about malicious intent; they correctly focus on the import pattern and coding style.\n\n**Consistency of scores:**\n- All scores are consistent with the code snippet's nature.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code is a simple import statement with no security issues.\n- The primary concern is the use of wildcard imports, which is a style issue, not a security one.\n- No evidence suggests malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n**Estimated scores based on the review:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code, no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, mostly stylistic concern)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code snippet is benign. The only noteworthy aspect is the use of wildcard imports, which should be replaced with explicit imports for better clarity and maintainability but do not pose security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** If further analysis of the 'app' and 'schema' modules is performed, that could change the assessment, but based solely on this snippet, there is no indication of malware or security issues.",
