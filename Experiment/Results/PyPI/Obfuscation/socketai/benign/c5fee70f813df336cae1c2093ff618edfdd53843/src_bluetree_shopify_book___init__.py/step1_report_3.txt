{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from local modules 'app' and 'schema', likely to include functions, classes, or variables for further use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules ('app' and 'schema') in the same package directory.",
  "sinks": "Potential misuse could occur if imported modules contain malicious code, but the import statements themselves do not directly execute untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Imported modules could execute code upon import or be used to process untrusted data later; however, the current snippet only shows imports without execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports ('*') is generally discouraged due to potential namespace pollution and obscurity, but it does not inherently indicate malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports all symbols from two local modules. There is no evidence of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks at this point. The use of wildcard imports can hide imported contents but is not malicious by itself. No external inputs, sinks, or dangerous behaviors are present in this minimal snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet appears to be standard import statements with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. The use of wildcard imports is a code quality concern but not a security threat.",
