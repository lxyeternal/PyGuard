{
  "purpose": "The code imports all definitions from local modules 'app' and 'schema', likely for application setup and data validation.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules within the package ('app' and 'schema'). No external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data output points are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no explicit data flows, as this is only import statements without further processing.",
  "anomalies": "Using 'from module import *' is considered a bad practice as it obscures imported contents and can potentially hide malicious or unintended code, but on its own, it does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting of import statements. It imports all contents from two local modules, which could potentially hide malicious code if those modules contain harmful logic. However, without inspecting the actual modules, these lines alone are not indicative of malicious behavior. The use of relative imports suggests this is part of a larger project, and no suspicious patterns such as dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious network activity are present here.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet only performs module imports and does not exhibit malicious behavior by itself. The use of 'import *' warrants caution in the context of the entire package, but based solely on this snippet, there is no evidence of malware or security risks.",
