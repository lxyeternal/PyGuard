{
  "purpose": "This code imports all objects and functions from the 'app' and 'schema' modules within the same package, likely to consolidate namespace or initialize components.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules '.app' and '.schema'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data handling or output occurs in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow is observable within this minimal code snippet; it only performs imports.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports ('*') can obscure what is imported, potentially hiding malicious or unintended code. No explicit anomalies in the import statements themselves, but the lack of specificity is noteworthy.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two import statements with wildcard imports from local modules. This pattern is common for package initialization but can sometimes be used to hide malicious code if those modules contain harmful logic. However, without inspecting the contents of 'app' and 'schema', there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior. The code itself does not perform any operations, data handling, or network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal import statement, which alone is not malicious. The use of wildcard imports warrants caution, as it can obscure imported contents. There is no immediate indication of malicious intent or security risks in this snippet.",
