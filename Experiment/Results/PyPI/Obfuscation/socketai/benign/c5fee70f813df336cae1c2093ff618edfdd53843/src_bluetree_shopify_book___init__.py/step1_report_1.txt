{
  "purpose": "The code imports all symbols from two modules: app and schema, likely for setting up or configuring an application.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.app and .schema).",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows are observable; import statements do not process untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports ('*') can obscure what symbols are imported and may lead to unintended behaviors, but it is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "This snippet only contains import statements from local modules. It does not process user input, network data, or handle sensitive data directly. The use of relative imports suggests this is part of a larger package. There are no signs of malicious activity, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The only concern is the use of wildcard imports, which can reduce code clarity but does not pose security risks by itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no malicious intent or security issues evident. It does not perform any dangerous operations. The primary concern is maintainability rather than security.",
