  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of import statements from local modules (.app and .schema).\n- The primary concern raised across reports is the use of wildcard imports ('*'), which can reduce code clarity and potentially hide malicious or unintended code.\n- None of the reports find evidence of malicious activity, external data handling, or obfuscated code.\n- The scores assigned are generally low, reflecting minimal security risk, with some variation in confidence levels.\n\n---\n\n### Specific review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correctly states that the code is just import statements with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.8\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate; the low malware and security risk scores are justified. The confidence is high given the simplicity of the code.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the lack of external operations.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.8\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher security risk score (0.2) might be justified due to the use of wildcard imports, which can obscure dependencies, but overall still low.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same as above, with emphasis on potential for imported modules to contain malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate; no evidence of malicious activity, and the high confidence reflects the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Similar, noting that the use of 'import *' can hide malicious code if present in modules.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.4\n- **Assessment:** The lower confidence score (0.4) seems justified given the minimal code, but the security risk score could be slightly higher if considering the potential for module contents to be malicious.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Similar, noting the potential risks of wildcard imports but no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.7\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate; the scores reflect the cautious stance due to the use of wildcard imports.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All zero, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variation, but generally low (0.1 to 0.2). Given the simplicity of the code, this seems reasonable.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The primary concern with this code is maintainability and clarity, not security.\n- The use of wildcard imports ('*') is discouraged but not inherently malicious.\n- Without inspecting the contents of 'app' and 'schema', we cannot definitively assess malicious potential, but based solely on these import statements, the risk remains minimal.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** **0** (no evidence of malicious activity)  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation present)  \n**Risk score:** **0.1** (minimal security concern, mainly maintainability)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe current scores are appropriate given the code snippet. The main concern is coding style (wildcard imports), not security. No changes are necessary unless further context reveals malicious content within the imported modules.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** If future analysis includes inspecting the contents of 'app' and 'schema', the risk assessment might need to be revisited.",
