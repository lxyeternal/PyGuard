  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and the associated code snippet.\n\n**Code snippet under review:**\n```python\nfrom .app import *\nfrom .schema import *\n```\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code **only** contains import statements from local modules (`.app` and `.schema`) using wildcard imports.\n- There are **no signs of malicious activity** such as data exfiltration, code injection, or network operations.\n- The code does **not** process untrusted data, execute dynamic code, or perform any suspicious actions.\n- The use of wildcard imports (`*`) is a **stylistic and maintainability concern**, but **not inherently malicious**.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** Importing all symbols from local modules; no malicious intent.\n- **Logic/Reasoning:** Correct; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1 (low), Confidence = 0.8.\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable. No change needed.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Same as above; wildcard imports, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.8.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate. No change needed.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Similar; import all symbols, no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1, Confidence = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Correct; no adjustment necessary.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Importing all contents; potential to hide malicious code if modules are malicious, but no evidence here.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.4.\n- **Assessment:** The low confidence reflects uncertainty about the modules' contents. Since the code only imports, the risk remains minimal. No change needed.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Similar import pattern; no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.7.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports, which is accurate; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** Low, reflecting the minimal security concern of import statements.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The primary concern with such code is **maintainability and clarity**, not security.\n- The use of `import *` can lead to namespace pollution and obscure dependencies, but **does not** constitute a security vulnerability in itself.\n- Without inspecting the contents of `app` and `schema`, we cannot definitively rule out malicious code hidden inside those modules. However, based solely on this snippet, there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Scores:** I agree with the current scores; no adjustments necessary.\n- **Additional notes:** If further analysis of the `app` and `schema` modules reveals malicious code, the malware score should be updated accordingly.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** approximately 0.1–0.2, consistent with current reports\n- **Confidence:** High that this code snippet is benign\n\n**This is a standard import pattern with no immediate security threats.**",
