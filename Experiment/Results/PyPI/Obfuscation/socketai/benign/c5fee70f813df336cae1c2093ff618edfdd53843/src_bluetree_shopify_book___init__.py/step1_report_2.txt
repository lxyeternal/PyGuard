{
  "purpose": "The code imports all objects from local modules 'app' and 'schema', likely for use elsewhere in the package.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules within the package directory",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks, as no untrusted data handling or external operations are present",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; purely static imports",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports (*), which can obscure dependencies and code flow but does not inherently indicate malicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two import statements importing everything from local modules 'app' and 'schema'. There are no data inputs, external network operations, or dynamic code execution. The use of wildcard imports is generally discouraged as it can lead to namespace pollution and hidden dependencies but is not malicious by itself. No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated content are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs simple module imports with no evident malicious behavior or security risks. The use of wildcard imports is a stylistic concern but not a security threat.",
