{
  "purpose": "The code defines two custom exception classes, likely for use in a larger Python application.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; only class definitions are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks such as data output, network operations, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only defines classes.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual class names that are obfuscated or nonsensical; no clear purpose or documentation provided.",
  "analysis": "The code contains two custom exception classes with lengthy, nonsensical names. There are no external data inputs, no code execution, no network operations, or other potentially malicious actions. The use of obfuscated or random class names might be suspicious if part of a malicious payload, but on its own, it does not indicate malicious intent. The code is minimal and straightforward, focusing solely on class definitions without any functional logic or external interactions.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet appears to be benign, consisting solely of custom exception class definitions with obfuscated names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this fragment.",
