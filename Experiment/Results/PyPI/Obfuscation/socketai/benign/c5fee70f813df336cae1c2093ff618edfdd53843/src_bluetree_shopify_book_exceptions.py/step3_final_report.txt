{
  "purpose": "Define two custom exception classes with obfuscated, nonsensical names, likely for use in larger codebases or as a form of obfuscation.",
  "sources": "Class definitions; no external input, data processing, or external calls.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external interactions; code does not process untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flow; class definitions are static.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated class names; no descriptive identifiers; minimal code structure.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains two class definitions inheriting from Exception with long, nonsensical names. No data input/output, no functions, no external interactions. The import of __future__.annotations is benign and unused here. The obfuscated class names could be an attempt at concealment but do not perform any malicious actions or contain malicious code. The absence of data flows or external calls indicates no active malicious behavior. The obfuscation level is high due to nonsensical naming, but the code itself is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, only defining two obfuscated exception classes with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation is notable but not malicious. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
