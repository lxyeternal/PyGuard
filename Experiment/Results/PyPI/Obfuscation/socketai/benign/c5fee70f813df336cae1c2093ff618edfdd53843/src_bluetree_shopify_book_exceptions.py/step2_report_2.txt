  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the original code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Original Code Recap:**\n```python\nfrom __future__ import annotations\nclass LCYUATeKuRTCAOUeVDpcaUZsGKuuJZCc(Exception):\n    pass\nclass VNoRoYVpJiqULwphasNEWXqtXPrbTZuV(Exception):\n    pass\n```\n- The code defines two custom exception classes with highly obfuscated, non-descriptive names.\n- No external input/output, data processing, or malicious code present.\n- The import of `__future__.annotations` is standard for forward references but unused here.\n- The code is minimal, syntactically correct, and does not perform any actions beyond class definitions.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Define two custom exceptions, possibly for larger application.\n- Anomalies: Obfuscated class names; no malicious code.\n- Analysis: Correctly notes the obfuscation and benign nature.\n- Confidence: 0.7; Obfuscated: 0.8; Malware: 0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No malicious behavior; obfuscation may be for concealment but isn't inherently malicious.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Define custom exception classes.\n- Anomalies: Obfuscated class names; no actual malicious code.\n- Analysis: Correctly states the code is benign, with no active malicious behavior.\n- Confidence: 0.9; Obfuscated: 0.2; Malware: 0.0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malware or security issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Define exception classes.\n- Anomalies: Nonsensical class names; no malicious activity.\n- Analysis: Properly identifies the code as benign.\n- Confidence: 0.8; Obfuscated: 0.7; Malware: 0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Define custom exceptions for larger codebase.\n- Anomalies: Obfuscated class names; no functional logic.\n- Analysis: No malicious intent; minimal, benign code.\n- Confidence: 1; Obfuscated: 0.2; Malware: 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Define exception classes, possibly for error handling.\n- Anomalies: Obfuscated class names; no malicious code.\n- Analysis: No malware; obfuscation noted but not suspicious on its own.\n- Confidence: 0.8; Obfuscated: 0.7; Malware: 0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on zero, and the code shows no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** High, as class names are intentionally obscure, which could be an attempt at concealment but isn't inherently malicious.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low, given the lack of any active malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.\n\n### My Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (consistent across reports and no evidence found)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.7 (high, due to class name obscurity)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, mostly due to obfuscation, but no active threat)\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n\nThe code is minimal, only defining two custom exceptions with obfuscated names. There are no signs of malicious activity, code injection, or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation might be intentional to conceal purpose but does not, in itself, indicate malicious intent.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign.\n- Obfuscation is the main concern but not malicious.\n- No malware present.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.7\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a detailed explanation or further analysis.",
