  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**Code Review:**\n- The code defines two custom exception classes with very long, obscure, and non-descriptive class names.\n- It imports `__future__.annotations`, which is benign and standard.\n- There are no data flows, input/output, external interactions, or malicious code.\n- The code is minimal, purely class definitions.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Defines two custom exceptions, possibly for larger application.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes no malicious behavior; obfuscated class names are suspicious but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0.8, confidence=0.7.\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable. Obfuscation is high, malware is zero, security risk is zero.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to above, defining custom exceptions.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies no malicious activity; class names are obfuscated but benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n- **Verdict:** Slightly lower obfuscation score aligns with the minimal obfuscation observed. Malware remains zero, security risk very low.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Same pattern.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity; obfuscated class names are noted but not suspicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0.7, confidence=0.8.\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable. Obfuscation is higher here, which matches the class names.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Same as others.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes no malicious behavior; obfuscated class names are suspicious but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0.2, confidence=1.\n- **Verdict:** The low obfuscation score is appropriate given the class names, and malware remains zero.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Same pattern.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity; class names are obfuscated but benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0.7, confidence=0.8.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious code present.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** They vary from 0.2 to 0.8, which seems proportional to the obfuscation level of class names.\n- **Security risk:** Very low across all, consistent with the absence of external data handling or malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations & Final Scores:**\n\n- The scores are generally consistent with the code and analysis.\n- The high obfuscation scores are justified given the non-descriptive class names.\n- Malware scores should remain at 0, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- Security risk scores are appropriately low, considering the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** Given the class names, I would assign an obfuscation score around 0.6–0.7, reflecting the obscure naming but not necessarily malicious intent.\n- **Risk:** Overall security risk remains very low, around 0.1 or less.\n\n---\n\n### **Final conclusion:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code. The obfuscation scores could be slightly adjusted upward to better reflect the class names, but overall, they are reasonable. Malware scores should stay at zero, and security risk remains minimal.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** ~0.6–0.7\n- **Risk:** ~0.1\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the nature of the code.",
