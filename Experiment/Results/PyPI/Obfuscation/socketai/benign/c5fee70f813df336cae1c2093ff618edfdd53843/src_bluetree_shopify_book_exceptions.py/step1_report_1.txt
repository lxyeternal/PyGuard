{
  "purpose": "Define two custom exception classes, likely for use in a larger application or module.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code only defines classes and does not perform any data processing or output.",
  "flows": "No data flows, as the code only contains class definitions without execution or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The class names are unusually long and obfuscated, with no descriptive naming conventions, which could be an attempt at obfuscation or concealment.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the __future__.annotations feature for forward reference type hints, then defines two custom exception classes inheriting from Exception. The class names appear intentionally obscure and do not provide meaningful context. No data input, output, or processing occurs. The code appears minimal and syntactically correct but unusually obfuscated in naming, which is suspicious. There are no active malicious behaviors or suspicious code constructs present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple class definition for custom exceptions with obfuscated class names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscated naming could be an attempt at concealment but does not in itself indicate malicious intent.",
