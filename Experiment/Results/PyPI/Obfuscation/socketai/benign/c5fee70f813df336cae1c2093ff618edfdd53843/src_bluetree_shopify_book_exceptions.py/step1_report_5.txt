{
  "purpose": "Define two custom exception classes, likely for specific error handling within a larger codebase.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No potential sinks; no data is processed or outputted.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs as the code only declares classes.",
  "anomalies": "The classes are named with non-descriptive, obfuscated-like names, which could suggest an attempt to hide intent. The use of __future__ import is standard and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from Exception, with obfuscated class names. There are no operations, input/output, or external data handling. The naming pattern appears intentionally obscure, which could be suspicious but also might be for obfuscation or non-standard naming conventions in a larger code context. No malicious behavior, code injection, or suspicious activity is evident. The code is minimal and does not exhibit malware traits.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet only defines two custom exception classes with obscure names, likely for error handling. There is no malicious behavior or security risk detected based on this limited code. The obfuscated class names warrant attention in the larger context but are not inherently malicious.",
