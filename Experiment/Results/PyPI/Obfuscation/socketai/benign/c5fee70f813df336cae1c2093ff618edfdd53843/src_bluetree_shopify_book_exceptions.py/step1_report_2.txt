  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks present.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obscure class names and non-descriptive identifiers; no actual malicious code or obfuscation. The exception classes are defined but not used or invoked.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the __future__.annotations feature for forward reference annotations, then defines two custom exception classes with seemingly random and obfuscated names. There are no functions, data handling, or suspicious logic. The class names do not reveal any malicious intent, and the code appears to serve a simple purpose of custom error definition. No malicious behaviors, malicious code injection, or backdoors are present. The structure is straightforward and unobfuscated.",
  "conclusion": "This code only defines two custom exception classes with obscure names but contains no malicious behavior or security issues. It appears benign and standard in function, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
