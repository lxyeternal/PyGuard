{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for potential use in larger codebase",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or data",
  "sinks": "None; no data or untrusted input is processed or output",
  "flows": "None; no data flow exists in this snippet",
  "anomalies": "Presence of non-descriptive, randomly generated class names; no functional logic; no use of secrets, external calls, or code injection mechanisms",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of two custom exception class definitions with non-standard, seemingly obfuscated class names. It imports the __future__ annotations feature but does not utilize it beyond that. There are no data sources, sinks, or flows. The code appears to be a minimal, possibly auto-generated or placeholder module with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. No evidence of malware or security risks present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign definition of custom exceptions with obfuscated class names. It does not contain any malicious or security-threatening behavior.",
