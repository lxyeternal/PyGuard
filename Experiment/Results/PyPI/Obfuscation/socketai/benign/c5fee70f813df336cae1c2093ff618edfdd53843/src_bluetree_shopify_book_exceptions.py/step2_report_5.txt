  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code and the provided scoring.\n\n**Code Review Summary:**\n- The code defines two custom exception classes with very long, obscure class names.\n- No data input/output, no functions, no execution, no external interactions.\n- The code imports `__future__.annotations` but doesn't utilize it beyond that.\n- The class names are not descriptive, which could be suspicious or obfuscatory.\n- No malicious code, no malware, no active behaviors.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Define exception classes, possibly for larger app.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes no data flow, no malicious behavior, obfuscated class names.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, no malware.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0.8, confidence=0.7\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. Obfuscation is high, malware is zero, and the conclusion is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Define custom exception classes.\n- **Analysis:** Same as above, emphasizes no malicious activity, benign.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, no security issues.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The malware score is zero, and the security risk is minimal. The obfuscation score is low, which is consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Define custom exception classes.\n- **Analysis:** Same as previous, notes obfuscated class names, no malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, no security risk.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0.7, confidence=0.8\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The obfuscation score is high but not indicative of malware. Malware remains zero.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** Repeats the same points, notes obfuscated names, no malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, no malware.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0.2, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent. The obfuscation score is low here, which is acceptable given the code.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Same purpose.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes no active malicious behavior, obfuscated names could be suspicious but not inherently malicious.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0.7, confidence=0.8\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- All reports agree that the code is minimal, defining only classes.\n- Obfuscation scores are high (0.7-0.8), which makes sense given the nonsensical class names.\n- Malware scores are consistently zero, which aligns with the code content.\n- Security risk scores are very low, as expected.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** I agree with 0 across all reports. No malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Given the class names, a high obfuscation score (~0.7) is justified.\n- **Risk score:** Since there's no active malicious behavior, a very low risk score (~0.1) is appropriate.\n\n**However,** I would note that the obfuscated class names could be a red flag if found in a larger context, but in this isolated snippet, they are not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n\n| Score Type        | Estimated Value | Justification                                              |\n|-------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0.0               | No malicious code or behavior present.                       |\n| Obfuscated        | 0.7               | Class names are long and nonsensical, indicating obfuscation. |\n| Security Risk     | 0.1               | No active security issues, minimal risk.                     |\n\n**Overall, the code appears benign, with obfuscation being the only notable factor.**",
