The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), consistent with the static, non-malicious nature of the code."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard Shopify API client with obfuscated naming and some inconsistent variable usage, likely due to obfuscation or code generation. No evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, or exfiltration is present. The primary security concern is ensuring proper validation of input parameters used in GraphQL queries to prevent injection. The overall malware score is 0, obfuscation is moderate (around 0.3), and security risk is low (around 0.2). The code appears safe and suitable for use, with recommendations to improve input validation and code clarity if possible."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is primarily a utility for rate-limited async task execution and string manipulation, with obfuscation and bugs but no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain threats. The main concern is fixing the 'description' variable bug. Overall, the security risk is low, and the code does not pose a malicious threat."

The high obfuscation scores in some reports are overstated; a moderate score (~0.3) better reflects the superficial variable name obfuscation. The malware score should be 0, and overall security risk is very low."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be primarily data validation and transformation routines with obfuscated identifiers. No evidence of malicious activity or security risks is present based on this fragment. The high obfuscation warrants further review of external modules, but current analysis indicates a low malware risk. The overall security risk score is appropriate, and no immediate action is necessary beyond further inspection of the imported utility functions."
