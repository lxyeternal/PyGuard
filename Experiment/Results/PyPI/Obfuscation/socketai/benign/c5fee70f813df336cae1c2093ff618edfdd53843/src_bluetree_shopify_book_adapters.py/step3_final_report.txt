{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to transform payload dictionaries into structured data objects, likely for API handling or data modeling within a Shopify-related context.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input dictionaries, accessing keys such as 'id', 'name', 'myshopifyDomain', 'metafields', 'variants', 'title', 'descriptionHtml', 'vendor', 'namespace', 'key', and 'value'.",
  "sinks": "There are no external sinks or data transmissions; data is used solely to instantiate data classes.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input dictionaries through key lookups into object constructors, with exception handling for missing keys, but no external effects or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Variable and class names are obfuscated, but this appears superficial; no malicious code, network activity, or system modifications are present. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward data transformation functions that convert input payloads into structured objects. No network, file, or code execution activities are present. Obfuscated variable names are superficial and do not indicate malicious intent. Exception handling is standard for missing keys. The overall purpose appears to be data modeling or API payload processing, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a data processing layer with superficial obfuscation. No malicious activity, backdoors, or supply chain sabotage are evident. The assigned malware score of 0 and low security risk score (~0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
