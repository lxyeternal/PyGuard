  "purpose": "Define a list of strings representing product or inventory attributes, likely used for processing product data.",
  "sources": "The list of strings assigned to the variable, which could be used as data or input labels elsewhere.",
  "sinks": "Potentially used in data processing, storage, or output; no direct untrusted input handling observed in this fragment.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows or untrusted data sources and sinks are demonstrated in this code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The variable name appears obfuscated or randomly generated, which may suggest an attempt to hide purpose or obfuscate data. No other suspicious code or behavior is present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement and the assignment of a list of strings to a variable with an obfuscated name. There are no functions, input handling, network operations, or other potentially malicious activities. The variable is static and only contains labeled data fields, typical in product data processing. The obfuscated variable name could be a sign of hiding intent, but without further code, it is not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a simple data structure definition without malicious intent. The obfuscated variable name is suspicious but not malicious on its own. No malware or security risks are evident in this fragment.",
