{
  "purpose": "The code defines a list of strings likely representing product attribute headers, possibly for a CSV or data processing context.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from a string list initialization, which is hardcoded within the script.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input/output functions are present; the code does not process external inputs or produce outputs directly.",
  "flows": "The code merely initializes a list; there are no data flows, input/output flows, or data processing flows beyond the static assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, such as hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or obfuscated constructs, are present. The code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a future import statement and a single list variable assignment with string elements. There are no functions, data processing, network operations, or external interactions. The list appears to be a set of headers for product data, typical in data management or import/export scripts. No suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or malicious constructs are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple static list declaration, with no malicious intent, no external data handling, and no suspicious behavior. It appears benign and intended for data header management.",
