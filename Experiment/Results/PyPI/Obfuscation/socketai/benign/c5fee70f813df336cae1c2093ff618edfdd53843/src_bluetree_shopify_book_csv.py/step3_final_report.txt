{
  "purpose": "A static list of product attribute headers, likely used for data management or CSV processing.",
  "sources": "The list itself is a hardcoded data structure; no external inputs or data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external outputs; the code does not process or output data dynamically.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows; the list is static and used as a constant reference.",
  "anomalies": "The variable name is obfuscated and unusual, which could hinder readability but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static assignment of a list of strings representing product attribute headers. The variable name is obfuscated, which raises suspicion but is not inherently malicious. No external data, network activity, or dynamic behavior is present. The list serves as configuration or header data, with no signs of malicious code, data leakage, or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation is superficial and does not impact security, but it could affect maintainability.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a static data structure for product attribute headers. The obfuscated variable name is the only unusual aspect but does not imply malicious intent. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), consistent with the static, non-malicious nature of the code.",
