  "purpose": "A Shopify API wrapper class facilitating GraphQL operations such as fetching shop info, products, variants, creating products, and managing metafields and collections.",
  "sources": "Reads static GraphQL query strings from a file; accepts input parameters for API calls, including IDs, filters, and input objects.",
  "sinks": "GraphQL execute calls transmitting data to Shopify's API; responses parsed internally; no external data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into GraphQL query payloads; responses are parsed and returned as structured data or objects.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable and method names; some inconsistent variable references (e.g., undefined variables like 'product_id' in methods); dynamic string formatting without explicit validation; potential for obfuscation or concealment but no malicious payloads detected.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a Shopify API client, executing GraphQL queries for shop info, product details, variants, creation, deletion, and collection management. Obfuscated variable names and some inconsistent variable references suggest code obfuscation or generated code, not necessarily malicious. The use of dynamic string formatting in GraphQL payloads could pose injection risks if inputs are untrusted, but no active malicious activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration are evident. The code does not perform any network connections to suspicious domains or execute harmful system commands. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate API wrapper with minor security considerations related to input validation and obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Shopify API client with obfuscated naming and some inconsistent variable usage, likely due to obfuscation or code generation. No evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, or exfiltration is present. The primary security concern is ensuring proper validation of input parameters used in GraphQL queries to prevent injection. The overall malware score is 0, obfuscation is moderate (around 0.3), and security risk is low (around 0.2). The code appears safe and suitable for use, with recommendations to improve input validation and code clarity if possible.",
