{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports components from local packages and defines public API exports, likely for a larger application or library.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: 'features', 'core', and 'core.handlers', which could potentially include untrusted code if they are malicious or compromised packages.",
  "sinks": "The code does not show any evident sinks such as network communication, file writing, or execution of untrusted code directly. It only defines imports and exports.",
  "flows": "Data flows from imported modules into this module, but there are no operations on data that could lead to leaks or malicious actions within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The import statements from 'core.handlers' include obfuscated names such as 'osyQqzHHCTlfwxTQQRONURDlIUBgXKGH' and others, which is unusual and suspicious, possibly indicating hidden or malicious code. No other anomalies like hardcoded credentials or code execution are present.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly performs import statements and defines an export list '__all__'. The presence of obfuscated identifiers in 'core.handlers' suggests potential malicious intent or at least suspicious obfuscation. Since the code does not execute any of the imported components or contain further logic, the risk is limited but warrants caution due to the obfuscated imports. No malicious actions are directly visible in this snippet, but the obfuscated names are a concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is structurally simple, mainly handling imports and exports. The obfuscated names in 'core.handlers' are suspicious, indicating possible malicious intent or concealment. However, without further context or execution of imported code, the risk remains moderate. The package should be reviewed further before trust.",
