{
  "purpose": "The code module imports submodules and specific attributes, then defines an export list, serving as a structural setup for a larger package.",
  "sources": "Relative imports of 'features', 'core', and 'core.handlers', specifically the obfuscated attributes in 'core.handlers'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform network or file operations.",
  "flows": "The code imports obfuscated handlers from 'core.handlers' but does not invoke or utilize them within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of highly obfuscated, nonsensical identifiers in 'core.handlers', which is unusual and suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard module with imports and exports. The main concern is the obfuscated identifiers in 'core.handlers', which could hide malicious functions or backdoors. No active malicious behavior or data leaks are evident. The obfuscation raises suspicion but is not conclusive evidence of malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports reflect this cautious stance, with low malware scores (~0.2-0.3), moderate obfuscation suspicion (~0.6-0.8), and moderate security risk (~0.3-0.4). Further investigation into the contents of the imported handlers is recommended to confirm their safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign structurally but employs obfuscated identifiers that could conceal malicious functions. No active malicious activity is evident, but the obfuscation warrants further review before trusting the package fully.",
