  "purpose": "This code is used for importing specific components (_menu and _terminal) from local modules and defining public API exports (MenuBuilder, TerminalBuilder).",
  "sources": "Import statements importing internal modules: ._menu and ._terminal.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling observed; imports are from local modules, no external data or network interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; only static imports and export definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Imported modules have obfuscated or non-descriptive names (e.g., QaRJyFQAprTpAkaKtVeXuZASzjAygYmY), which could be suspicious but are not necessarily malicious. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs simple imports from internal modules with non-descriptive names, potentially indicating obfuscation or concealment. The __all__ list exposes specific classes for external use, consistent with standard Python practices. No code execution, data handling, or network activity present. The unusual module names warrant cautious review of the respective modules, but the snippet itself is benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be standard module import and export setup with obfuscated internal module names. There is no evident malicious behavior or security risk in this fragment. The primary concern is the obfuscated internal module names, which could be suspicious but do not indicate malicious intent in this snippet.",
