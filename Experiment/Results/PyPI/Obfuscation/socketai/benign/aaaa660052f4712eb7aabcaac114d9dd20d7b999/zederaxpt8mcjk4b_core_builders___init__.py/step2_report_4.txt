  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their assessments with the code snippet, and then synthesize an overall security stance.\n\n**Code Overview:**\n- Imports two components from internal modules: `._menu` and `._terminal`.\n- The imported components have obfuscated names: `QaRJyFQAprTpAkaKtVeXuZASzjAygYmY` and `HswauudfhYzSTjuKFPWiCLZsxkTCtWuh`.\n- Defines `__all__` with `MenuBuilder` and `TerminalBuilder`, which are presumably the public API classes.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming if issues are present:\n- The code itself is straightforward: static imports and an `__all__` list.\n- No direct data flows, network operations, or untrusted data handling.\n- The only concern is the obfuscated import names, which could be an attempt to hide malicious code or simply code obfuscation.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- No logical errors are evident in this snippet.\n- The obfuscated names are suspicious but not inherently malicious.\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions by itself.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0 or very low, which aligns with the absence of malicious actions in this snippet.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Ranges from 0.3 to 0.7, reflecting suspicion about the obfuscated names.\n- **Security risk:** Mostly low, except for report 3 which assigns a slightly higher risk (0.3) due to the obfuscated internal module attributes.\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n- The scores above 0.5 (e.g., 0.6 or 0.7) are primarily due to the obfuscated names, which could conceal malicious behavior within the imported components.\n- However, without inspecting the actual contents of `_menu` and `_terminal`, the risk remains speculative.\n\n### Malware assessment:\n- All reports agree that there's no evidence of malware in this code snippet.\n- The obfuscation could be benign or malicious; without further context, the malware score should remain at 0.\n\n### Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:\n- The reports correctly identify that obfuscation is suspicious but do not assume malicious intent without evidence.\n- No unwarranted claims are made about vulnerabilities.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis: low malware risk, moderate to high obfuscation concern, and low security risk overall.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Overall malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious activity).\n- **Obfuscated score:** Given the obfuscated names and lack of context, a score around 0.6-0.7 seems reasonable.\n- **Risk score:** Since the code itself is benign but obfuscated, a moderate risk score (~0.4-0.5) is appropriate, but not higher.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The code is a standard Python module initializer with obfuscated internal component names.\n- No direct malicious activity or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n- The obfuscation warrants caution, but without inspecting the imported components, the risk remains speculative.\n\n**My final estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no evidence)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0.65** (moderate suspicion)\n- **Risk score:** **0.4** (moderate due to obfuscation, but no active threat)\n\nProceed with caution and review the actual contents of `_menu` and `_terminal` modules for any hidden malicious code.",
