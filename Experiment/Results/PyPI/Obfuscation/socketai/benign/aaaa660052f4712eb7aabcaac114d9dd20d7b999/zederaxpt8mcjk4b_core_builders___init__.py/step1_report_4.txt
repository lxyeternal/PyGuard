{
  "purpose": "Module exports specific classes 'MenuBuilder' and 'TerminalBuilder' for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements for internal modules '_menu' and '_terminal', importing classes with obfuscated names.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no use of untrusted input, network operations, or sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; code only imports classes and defines __all__ without further data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated class names '_menu' and '_terminal' in import statements; no direct usage or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes with obfuscated internal names from local modules, then exposes 'MenuBuilder' and 'TerminalBuilder' in __all__. No evidence of malicious code, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The obfuscated names could be a method to conceal implementation details but do not inherently indicate malicious intent. The code is minimal and straightforward, serving as an export module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module for exporting classes, with obfuscated internal class names. No malicious behavior detected; the obfuscation alone is not suspicious. Overall security risk is very low.",
