  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class with a method that returns a callable and a method that invokes this callable.",
  "sources": "Import from ..handlers, usage of class constructor parameter, call to self.trBpVyMyfcnlszcLGTfeycleyPUsHKzr()",
  "sinks": "self.trBpVyMyfcnlszcLGTfeycleyPUsHKzr() is invoked and then called as a function",
  "flows": "The method UbfthIEPHlgfdISdRwYxXsdGzFElaBcQ calls the abstract method, which returns a callable, then executes it.",
  "anomalies": "The variable sdsCZnGLcyDxemlWmUwTfInwhMNxWRNS is assigned a string but never used, possibly obfuscation or placeholder.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class with an abstract method that should return a callable object. The method UbfthIEPHlgfdISdRwYxXsdGzFElaBcQ retrieves this callable and executes it. The string variable inside the abstract method appears unused, possibly obfuscation or placeholder. The code does not include any suspicious or malicious constructs such as network operations, file manipulations, or data exfiltration. Usage of relative import indicates it’s part of a larger package, but on its own, it contains no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard abstract class structure with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. No suspicious or harmful behavior detected.",
