  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; no runtime data processing or output",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; import is static",
  "anomalies": "The imported module name 'OtoOCSJfIPqfKtSFWWCvETwEYPlCMtih' appears obfuscated or randomly generated, which is suspicious. The name does not suggest a meaningful or standard library, indicating potential obfuscation or concealment.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement importing a module with an obfuscated name and a list defining exports. The import source is local, which is typical in package modules. However, the use of a highly obfuscated module name raises suspicion that it might hide malicious code or intended to evade detection. There are no other code segments, runtime behaviors, or suspicious patterns evident in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This minimal code snippet appears benign in function but suspicious due to the obfuscated module name. The risk is primarily from the potential malicious intent of the imported module, which cannot be assessed here. The overall security risk is elevated due to the obfuscation but no active malicious behavior can be confirmed from this fragment alone.",
