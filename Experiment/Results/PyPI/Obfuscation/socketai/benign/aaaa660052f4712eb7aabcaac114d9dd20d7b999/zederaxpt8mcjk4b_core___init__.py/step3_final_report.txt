{
  "purpose": "The code imports an obfuscated module and a local handlers module, then exposes 'models' and 'handlers' via __all__.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing a module with an obfuscated name and local 'handlers' module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "The import of the obfuscated module and 'handlers' without further data processing or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a highly obfuscated module name, which could be used to hide malicious code or unwanted behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of an import statement and an __all__ declaration. The obfuscated module name raises suspicion but does not demonstrate malicious activity directly. No data leaks, network calls, or data processing are visible. The obfuscation could be used for legitimate reasons or to conceal malicious code, but further inspection of the imported module is necessary to confirm. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0.75, risk: 0.3) are consistent with this assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet appears benign in isolation but employs obfuscation that warrants further review of the imported module. No active malicious behavior is evident from this fragment, but the suspicious naming suggests caution. The current scores are appropriate; further analysis of the imported module is recommended to rule out malicious intent.",
