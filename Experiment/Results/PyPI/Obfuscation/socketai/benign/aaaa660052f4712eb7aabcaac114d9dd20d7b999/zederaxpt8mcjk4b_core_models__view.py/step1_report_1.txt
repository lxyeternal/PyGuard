{
  "purpose": "Define a Pydantic model for a view configuration with specified fields.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are the field initializations and default values, especially the 'Callable' for the view function.",
  "sinks": "Potential sink is the 'YAedSUAIDpHqnuTXmjwDVTLuUXhRLsst' field which can accept any callable, possibly including dangerous functions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the input fields into the model, especially the callable function, which could be invoked elsewhere. No explicit execution or network calls are present.",
  "anomalies": "The use of obfuscated variable names (e.g., wCaRHGUUtXXcmCWkwUWcYbZMVMsmlgcO, vIlKUtcDKnOVSLoTKrpCmhKhPiQxiqJB) and the inclusion of a 'Callable' type suggest possible obfuscation. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code actions are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and a local module. It defines a model with fields for view name, description, a function, optional confirmation message, and a wait flag. Variable and class names are obfuscated, but the structure appears to be a straightforward data container for view configuration. The callable field could potentially execute arbitrary code when invoked elsewhere, but as shown, there is no direct malicious behavior or malicious code execution. No suspicious data leaks, hardcoded credentials, or malicious logic are present in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate model definition with obfuscated names. No evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks is detected within this isolated code snippet.",
