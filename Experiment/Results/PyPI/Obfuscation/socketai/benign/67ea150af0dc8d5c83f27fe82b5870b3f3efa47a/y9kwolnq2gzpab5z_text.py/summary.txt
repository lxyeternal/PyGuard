  "obfuscated": 0.8,
  "confidence": 0.75,
  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated with secret byte sequences and complex tensor manipulations, indicating a high potential for covert data handling or hidden payloads. While no explicit malicious activity is observed, the obfuscation and secret sequences justify a cautious stance. The malware score is set at 0.5 to reflect the suspicion, and the security risk score at 0.6 due to the potential for covert data concealment. The obfuscation score remains high at 0.8, consistent with the variable naming and secret bytes. Overall, the code warrants careful review before deployment, especially if sourced from untrusted origins."
