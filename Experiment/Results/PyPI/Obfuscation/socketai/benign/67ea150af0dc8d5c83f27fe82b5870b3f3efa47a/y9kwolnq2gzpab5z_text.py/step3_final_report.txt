  "purpose": "Utility functions for tensor and string processing, including encoding, decoding, splitting, and tensor shape manipulations, with obfuscated variable names and secret byte sequences.",
  "sources": "Functions reading string and tensor data, secret byte sequences, tensor shape and data transformations, custom modules with unclear implementations.",
  "sinks": "Data transformations that could potentially encode or hide data, but no direct data exfiltration, network, or system modification observed.",
  "flows": "Input data (strings/tensors) processed through encoding/decoding functions, tensor shape manipulations, and byte-level operations, with potential for covert data handling via obfuscation.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, secret byte sequences (e.g., b'\\x02', b'\\x03'), complex tensor shape manipulations, use of custom modules with unknown implementations, functions that handle raw bytes and encoding transformations.",
  "analysis": "The code employs heavy obfuscation through variable naming and secret byte sequences, possibly to conceal malicious payloads or backdoors. Functions perform encoding, decoding, tensor shape adjustments, and byte manipulations, which could be exploited for covert data hiding. No network or system access is evident, but the obfuscation and secret sequences raise suspicion. The complex tensor and string processing routines are consistent with attempts to hide or encode data covertly. The use of custom modules without visible implementation details further complicates assessment. Overall, the code exhibits high obfuscation and potential for covert data handling, but lacks direct malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated with secret byte sequences and complex tensor manipulations, indicating a high potential for covert data handling or hidden payloads. While no explicit malicious activity is observed, the obfuscation and secret sequences justify a cautious stance. The malware score is set at 0.5 to reflect the suspicion, and the security risk score at 0.6 due to the potential for covert data concealment. The obfuscation score remains high at 0.8, consistent with the variable naming and secret bytes. Overall, the code warrants careful review before deployment, especially if sourced from untrusted origins.",
