  "conclusion": "The code is a set of standard tensor utility functions for language model inference, with obfuscated names but no evidence of malicious behavior or payloads. The high obfuscation score is justified by naming but does not imply malicious intent. The malware score remains at 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2). The code appears benign and typical for ML inference pipelines."
