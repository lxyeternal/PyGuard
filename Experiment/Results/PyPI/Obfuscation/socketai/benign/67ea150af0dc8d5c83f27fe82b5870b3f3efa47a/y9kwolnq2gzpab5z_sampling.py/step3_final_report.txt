  "purpose": "Tensor utility functions for language model inference, including masking, sampling, top-k filtering, temperature scaling, and logits manipulation.",
  "sources": "Tensor inputs representing logits; internal tensor operations; no external data sources or inputs.",
  "sinks": "Tensor transformations within the process; no network, file, or external system interactions.",
  "flows": "Input logits -> masking, top-k filtering, temperature scaling -> sampling or argmax -> output tokens.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of variable and function names; use of -np.inf for masking, which is standard but can be obfuscation. No malicious payloads or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard ML inference utilities for language models, with functions for masking logits, sampling with temperature and top-k, and other tensor manipulations. Obfuscated naming is present but does not indicate malicious intent. No external system calls, network activity, or data exfiltration observed. The use of masking with -np.inf is typical in language modeling. The functions rely solely on tensor operations and random sampling. Scores assigned in the reports (malware 0, obfuscated ~0.6-0.8, risk ~0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and obfuscation level.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of standard tensor utility functions for language model inference, with obfuscated names but no evidence of malicious behavior or payloads. The high obfuscation score is justified by naming but does not imply malicious intent. The malware score remains at 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2). The code appears benign and typical for ML inference pipelines.",
