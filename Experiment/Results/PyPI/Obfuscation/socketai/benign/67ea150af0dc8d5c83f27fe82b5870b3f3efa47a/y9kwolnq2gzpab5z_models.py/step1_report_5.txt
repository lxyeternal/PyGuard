{
  "purpose": "Defines two TensorFlow Keras models for machine learning tasks, involving custom loss calculations and probabilistic sampling.",
  "sources": "Imports modules, class initializers, and methods accessing class attributes and function arguments; uses tf.Tensor inputs and sample_weight.",
  "sinks": "Potential data flows include usage of tf.random.normal (sampling) and tf.cast (type conversions), but no direct untrusted data sink identified.",
  "flows": "Input tensors (x, y, y_pred, sample_weight) flow through custom loss functions and probabilistic sampling functions without external untrusted data sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obscure function names and variable names; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines models for training and probabilistic sampling, with custom loss functions and scheduling. No network calls, data exfiltration, or suspicious behaviors identified. No external inputs from untrusted sources are evident. The structure appears typical for machine learning code, and no malicious patterns or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate machine learning model definitions with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It performs standard probabilistic sampling, custom loss calculation, and model configuration, with no suspicious behaviors or external communication.",
