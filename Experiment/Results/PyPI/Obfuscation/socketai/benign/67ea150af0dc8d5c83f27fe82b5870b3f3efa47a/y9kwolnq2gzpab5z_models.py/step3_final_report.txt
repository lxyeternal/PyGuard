{
  "purpose": "The code defines complex probabilistic and scheduling models for machine learning, with heavily obfuscated identifiers, likely for proprietary or intellectual property reasons.",
  "sources": "Input tensors, model methods, serialization functions, and internal data flows within the model classes.",
  "sinks": "Data flows internally within the model; no external network activity, data exfiltration, or external sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input tensors through masking, probabilistic sampling, loss calculations, and variable updates within the model methods.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names, but no hardcoded secrets, network calls, or suspicious external interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard ML components such as custom loss functions, probabilistic sampling, and training schedules. Obfuscation appears to be for proprietary reasons rather than malicious intent. No external communication, backdoors, or malicious payloads are evident. The high obfuscation scores are justified, but the malware score remains at zero due to lack of malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a complex, obfuscated implementation of legitimate machine learning models. Despite high obfuscation, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The supply chain security risk is low, with the primary concern being obfuscation for proprietary reasons rather than malicious intent.",
