{
  "purpose": "The code defines two TensorFlow Keras models, likely for machine learning tasks involving probabilistic modeling and training schedules.",
  "sources": "Input tensors 'x', 'y', 'y_pred', 'sample_weight' in methods, environment variables (potentially via self._rate), attributes such as '_contrast_weight', and class configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "Usage of 'mlable.masking.rMqxirfjQnczNLcWQYWhTKBAmgkEQOIb' function, tensor operations, and model training routines. No direct data leakage or external data transmission observed.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through masking functions, model computations, and loss calculations. No external network communication or file operations are evident.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function and variable names (e.g., 'XnzCPVOLBigzmFeYUNAGbDTTgsQnwZrN', 'zhScxqJuHFTNVfkUGuZmOMjZMennmXYY') suggest intentional concealment. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code structures detected. Use of dynamic partial functions for schedules is typical in ML models.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily involves defining model classes with training routines, loss calculations, and scheduling for training steps. The obfuscated names could be an attempt to hide intent, but functionally, the code appears to implement common probabilistic and training mechanisms. No external network connections, data exfiltration, or malicious system modifications are present. The functions and variables are consistent with standard ML practices, albeit with obscure naming.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of probabilistic models and training schedules, with no evident malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. The obfuscation is likely for code concealment rather than malicious intent. Overall security risk is low.",
