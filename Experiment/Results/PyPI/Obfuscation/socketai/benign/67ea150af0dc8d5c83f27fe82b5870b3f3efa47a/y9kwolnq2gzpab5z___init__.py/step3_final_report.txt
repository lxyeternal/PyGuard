  "purpose": "Evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code analysis for malicious patterns, obfuscation, and vulnerabilities.",
  "sources": "Input data reads, environment variables, network communication, dynamic code execution points, and external library calls.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission functions, file system writes, environment variable access, and dynamic execution functions like eval or exec.",
  "flows": "Sources such as data collection or input points flow into sinks like network send, file write, or code execution, indicating potential malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, hardcoded credentials, suspicious network patterns, or unusual import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code appears benign with straightforward data processing, no obfuscation, and no suspicious network activity. In cases where patterns suggest data exfiltration or dynamic code execution, suspicion increases but no definitive malicious payloads are observed. The scores reflect this, with low malware (0.2) and obfuscation (0.1) for benign scripts, and moderate suspicion (0.3 malware, 0.2 obfuscation) where patterns are suspicious but not confirmed. Confidence levels align with the amount of code and pattern clarity. Overall, the assessments are consistent, with minor adjustments suggested for the malware score in Report 5.",
  "conclusion": "Most code is benign, with low security risk and no obfuscation or malware detected. Suspicious patterns in some reports justify moderate suspicion, but no definitive malicious activity is confirmed. The scores are appropriate, with a slight recommendation to lower the malware suspicion in Report 5 from 0.3 to 0.2 for accuracy.",
