{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple utility script that performs data processing and possibly interacts with external systems or files, but without further context, its main function is to handle data transformations or computations.",
  "sources": "Input data may come from function parameters, external files, or environment variables (not explicitly shown). No specific input sources are clearly identified in the provided code snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, network communications, file writes, or data exports, but no explicit sink points are evident in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "The data flow seems to start from data sources (parameters or files), goes through processing functions, and possibly outputs or stores results, but explicit source-to-sink paths are not shown.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious functions are observed. The code structure appears straightforward and typical for a utility module.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with clear variable usage and no signs of obfuscation or malicious constructs. There are no evident attempts to hide functionality or include malicious payloads. Without additional context or code parts, it’s challenging to identify malicious intent. The absence of suspicious network activity, backdoors, or credential theft mechanisms indicates low likelihood of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be standard data processing logic with no hidden malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
