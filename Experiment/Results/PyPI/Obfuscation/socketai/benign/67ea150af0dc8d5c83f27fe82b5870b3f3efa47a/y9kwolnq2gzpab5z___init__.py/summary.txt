  "conclusion": "Most code is benign, with low security risk and no obfuscation or malware detected. Suspicious patterns in some reports justify moderate suspicion, but no definitive malicious activity is confirmed. The scores are appropriate, with a slight recommendation to lower the malware suspicion in Report 5 from 0.3 to 0.2 for accuracy."
