{
  "purpose": "A tensor-based function to normalize and scale a 'step' parameter within specified bounds, likely used for parameter scheduling or normalization in machine learning workflows.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'step', 'step_min', 'step_max', 'rate_min', 'rate_max'; uses tensor operations and partial application of tf.cast.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; the code performs in-memory tensor calculations without external data or network communication.",
  "flows": "Input 'step' flows through tensor operations: subtraction, division, clamping, and scaling to produce a float output within specified rate bounds.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names and use of functools.partial with tf.cast, but no malicious or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard normalization and scaling procedure using TensorFlow tensors, with obfuscated variable names that do not indicate malicious intent. No network activity, secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. The tensor operations are typical for ML parameter scheduling. The obfuscation appears to be for concealment or code reuse, not malicious sabotage. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility function for parameter scaling in ML contexts, with obfuscation but no malicious or security threats. The low malware and risk scores are appropriate given the analysis.",
