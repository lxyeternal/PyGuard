  "purpose": "The function compares two tensors element-wise for inequality and returns a weighted combination of the comparison result and its inverse, scaled by a parameter.",
  "sources": "The input tensors QPEzOKugoHmyDsFlUxoemqDsJkcZatvk and OQCDqPTeopHChkIPVlcPhrxgKJBNiVtQ.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; the code does not write data to external systems or network, nor does it execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Input tensors are compared with tf.not_equal, then casted to a specific dtype, then combined mathematically to produce output.",
  "anomalies": "The function uses obfuscated variable names, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that performs an element-wise inequality comparison between two tensors, casts the boolean result to a specified data type, and returns a weighted sum combining this result and its inverse, controlled by a parameter. The code appears straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation techniques beyond the variable naming. It does not interact with external systems, perform network operations, or include any hidden code. The use of obscure variable names might suggest an attempt to conceal intent, but in isolation, this is not enough to indicate malicious activity. Overall, the code performs a simple tensor operation without malicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign tensor manipulation function with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscated variable names are suspicious but not indicative of malware. The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose, such as a component in a larger tensor-based computation.",
