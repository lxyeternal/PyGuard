  "purpose": "Performs an element-wise inequality comparison between two tensors, casts the boolean result to a specified dtype, and combines this with a weighted parameter to produce an output tensor.",
  "sources": "Reads two input tensors (QPEzOKugoHmyDsFlUxoemqDsJkcZatvk and OQCDqPTeopHChkIPVlcPhrxgKJBNiVtQ).",
  "sinks": "No external data or system interactions; operates solely within tensor computations.",
  "flows": "Element-wise comparison from input tensors to boolean mask, cast to dtype, then combined with weighted sum to produce output.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are obfuscated but operations are straightforward; no hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code compares two tensors for inequality, casts the boolean result to a specified dtype, and computes a weighted sum with the inverse of the comparison. No external data access, network calls, or malicious code are present. Obfuscated variable names are superficial and do not indicate malicious intent. The operations are standard tensor manipulations in TensorFlow, with no signs of sabotage or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a simple tensor comparison and combination. No malicious activity or security vulnerabilities are evident. Obfuscation is superficial and does not imply malicious intent. Overall, the code poses minimal security risk.",
