{
  "purpose": "The function computes a weighted difference (or similarity) between two tensors, potentially for use in neural network operations or comparisons.",
  "sources": "Inputs: QPEzOKugoHmyDsFlUxoemqDsJkcZatvk and OQCDqPTeopHChkIPVlcPhrxgKJBNiVtQ, which are tensors provided as function arguments.",
  "sinks": "The function performs tensor operations internally without external data sinks; no data leaks or external system calls are present.",
  "flows": "Inputs are compared with tf.not_equal, then cast to a specified dtype, then combined mathematically with provided weights.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual language features, or obfuscated code detected. The code performs straightforward tensor operations.",
  "analysis": "The code compares two tensors for inequality, casts the boolean result to a numeric type, then applies a weighted sum to produce a scalar or tensor output. It uses standard TensorFlow functions with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. No external data access, network calls, or obfuscated constructs are present. The purpose appears to be a simple similarity or difference metric, typical in ML models.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard tensor comparison and combination operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling.",
