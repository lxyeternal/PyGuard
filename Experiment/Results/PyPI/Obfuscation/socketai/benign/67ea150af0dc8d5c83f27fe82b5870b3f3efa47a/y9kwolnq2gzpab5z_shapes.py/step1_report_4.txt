{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform various list manipulations, shape transformations, and mathematical operations on lists, likely for tensor or array-like data processing.",
  "sources": "Reads data from input parameters: 'shape', 'axes', 'QPEzOKugoHmyDsFlUxoemqDsJkcZatvk', 'OQCDqPTeopHChkIPVlcPhrxgKJBNiVtQ', 'before', 'after'. It also imports from an external module 'mlable.utils'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks of untrusted data, network operations, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed through various functions that generate lists and perform index and value manipulations. Data flows involve list comprehensions, list indexing, and list modification, with no external output or side effects.",
  "anomalies": "Code contains obfuscated variable names and some calls to an external utility 'mlable.utils.bclgyaMcyjCOqWvmIIHUEIlFtTFhAfoK'. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external calls are evident. The code appears to be intentionally obscure but does not exhibit malicious intent based on content.",
  "analysis": "The script defines multiple functions performing mathematical and list operations, including shape manipulations and index calculations. Variable names are intentionally obfuscated, and external dependency 'mlable.utils' is invoked for a list slicing utility. No network activity, file modifications, or sensitive data handling are present. The code seems to serve as utility functions for tensor or array reshaping, with no indicators of malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious logic, or malicious side effects are detected. The obfuscation appears to be for code complexity or concealment rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is obfuscated utility code likely intended for tensor or array shape manipulation. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior based on static analysis. There are no external communication, backdoors, or malicious data leaks observed. The obfuscation is not suspicious in itself but may hinder readability. Overall, the code appears safe.",
