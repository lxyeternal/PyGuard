{
  "purpose": "These functions perform tensor shape and list manipulations, likely for internal shape management in tensor operations.",
  "sources": "Input parameters (shape lists, dimensions, axes), reliance on external 'mlable.utils' functions.",
  "sinks": "No external system, network, or file interactions; data flows are internal within list and shape manipulations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through list comprehensions and utility functions, ultimately returning modified shape or index lists.",
  "anomalies": "Use of heavily obfuscated variable and function names; reliance on external utility 'mlable.utils' and 'bclgyaMcyjCOqWvmIIHUEIlFtTFhAfoK' which are opaque; no explicit malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of shape and list manipulation functions with obfuscated identifiers, typical in tensor utility libraries. No network, file, or system commands are present. External utility functions are invoked but their content is unknown; no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or system modification are evident. Obfuscation appears superficial, possibly for concealment, but does not necessarily indicate malicious intent. The functions perform standard tensor shape operations, and the overall logic is consistent with legitimate utility code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of tensor shape utility functions with obfuscated identifiers. No malicious behavior or sabotage is evident from static analysis. The reliance on external utilities warrants caution, but within this context, the code is benign. The obfuscation and external dependencies should be monitored, but no immediate security threat is detected.",
