  "conclusion": "The code is a set of obfuscated data processing utilities with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The obfuscation may serve to conceal complexity but does not indicate malicious activity. Scores reflect low malware risk (0), high obfuscation (around 0.7), and low security risk (around 0.2). Continuous monitoring is recommended if integrated into larger systems, but current evidence suggests a benign purpose."
