  "purpose": "Utility functions for encoding data, writing to files, and processing datasets, primarily for data manipulation and analysis.",
  "sources": "Functions read input data (strings, datasets), perform encoding, and write output files.",
  "sinks": "File writing operations; no external network or system calls observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input variables through encoding and processing functions into file outputs; no external communication or malicious payloads detected.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with nonsensical variable and function names; encoding functions could be used to hide payloads but are benign in isolation.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises data encoding, dataset analysis, and file writing utilities. No network activity, external system calls, or malicious payloads are present. Obfuscation appears to be a style choice rather than an indicator of malicious intent. The functions could be misused to conceal malicious data, but no evidence supports this. The dataset processing functions perform standard operations without malicious side effects. Overall, the code is benign utility code with high obfuscation but no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of obfuscated data processing utilities with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The obfuscation may serve to conceal complexity but does not indicate malicious activity. Scores reflect low malware risk (0), high obfuscation (around 0.7), and low security risk (around 0.2). Continuous monitoring is recommended if integrated into larger systems, but current evidence suggests a benign purpose.",
