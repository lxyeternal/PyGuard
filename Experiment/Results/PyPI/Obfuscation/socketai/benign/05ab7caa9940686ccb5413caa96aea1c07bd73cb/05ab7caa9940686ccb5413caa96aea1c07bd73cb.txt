      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard library registration with obfuscated identifiers. There is no concrete evidence of malicious activity or supply chain attack. However, the obfuscation warrants further review to ensure no secrets or malicious payloads are hidden within the variables. The overall security risk remains moderate, and no malware is detected."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate SSH resource class with configurable security trade-offs. It does not contain malicious code or obfuscation for malicious intent. The primary concern is the insecure configuration options that could be exploited if misused. The malware score is 0, and the obfuscation score is moderate (~0.6) due to variable naming. The security risk score should reflect the insecure practices, approximately 0.75, given the potential for exploitation. Overall, the code is not malicious but warrants security review and default configuration improvements."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving likely as a version indicator or internal configuration. The obfuscation is superficial and does not imply malicious intent. No security risks are present, and the current assessments are appropriate."
