{
  "purpose": "The code appears to register a resource from the 'dagster_ssh' package and define exports for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules and variables from 'dagster_shared' and 'dagster_ssh', and a registration call with a version constant.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or leaks occur; the code primarily imports and registers modules.",
  "flows": "Imports -> Registration of a version constant -> Export of symbols",
  "anomalies": "The variable names for imported entities (e.g., RjRMerGtzEHWWPdGtbmVPcoaqKmuVZPF) are highly obfuscated and look like random strings, which could be a sign of code obfuscation or intentionally hidden logic. The registration call uses a version string that appears as a random hash, but this alone is not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific modules and variables, registers a library with a version identifier, and defines exported symbols. The obfuscated variable names are unusual and could suggest an attempt to hide the real purpose. However, the overall structure is consistent with normal package registration and module export patterns. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or network activity. The registration process and imports are typical for package setup code. The obfuscation could be benign or malicious, but there is no evidence of malicious activity in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily performs module registration and exports, with highly obfuscated variable names. There is no clear evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this fragment. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not necessarily indicate malicious intent.",
