  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate SSH resource class with configurable security trade-offs. It does not contain malicious code or obfuscation for malicious intent. The primary concern is the insecure configuration options that could be exploited if misused. The malware score is 0, and the obfuscation score is moderate (~0.6) due to variable naming. The security risk score should reflect the insecure practices, approximately 0.75, given the potential for exploitation. Overall, the code is not malicious but warrants security review and default configuration improvements."
