{
  "purpose": "Assign a version string to an obfuscated variable name, likely for internal tracking or configuration.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only assigns a static string to a variable.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; no data leaks or external effects occur.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The variable name is obfuscated, but this alone does not imply malicious intent; the assigned value appears benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple assignment of a version string '0.26.12' to an obfuscated variable name. No inputs, outputs, network activity, or malicious functions are present. The obfuscation is superficial and does not indicate malicious behavior. No evidence of malware, data exfiltration, or security vulnerabilities is observed. The scores should reflect the benign nature, with malware score at 0, low security risk, and a moderate obfuscation score due to variable name obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving likely as a version indicator or internal configuration. The obfuscation is superficial and does not imply malicious intent. No security risks are present, and the current assessments are appropriate.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.5,
