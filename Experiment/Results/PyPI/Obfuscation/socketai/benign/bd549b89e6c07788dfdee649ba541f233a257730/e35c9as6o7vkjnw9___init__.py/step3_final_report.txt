  "purpose": "Manage feature toggles loaded from YAML or string input, with validation and expiry warnings.",
  "sources": "YAML configuration file or string input, call stack via inspect for logging purposes.",
  "sinks": "Logging toggle checks and expiry warnings, raising exceptions for undeclared or misconfigured toggles, setting attributes dynamically.",
  "flows": "YAML load or file read -> toggle object creation -> attribute access triggers logging -> expiry check logs warning if feature is old.",
  "anomalies": "Use of inspect for logging toggle checks; undefined variables in exception messages ('not_declared', 'not_configured') are bugs but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code manages feature toggles with validation against declared toggles, loads YAML safely with 'SafeLoader', and logs toggle checks and expiry warnings. Use of inspect is benign, serving for logging/debugging. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or network activity detected. Minor bugs in exception messages are present but do not impact security. Variable obfuscation is superficial and not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard feature toggle management implementation with safe YAML handling and logging. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The obfuscation is superficial, and the overall security risk is low.",
