{
  "purpose": "The code appears to manage feature toggles, allowing dynamic enabling/disabling of features based on configuration files or inline definitions.",
  "sources": "Reading configuration from a YAML file or string input during class initialization; inspecting call stack frames during attribute access.",
  "sinks": "Logging feature toggle checks; setting class attributes based on configuration data.",
  "flows": "Input YAML or file data -> stored in class attributes -> accessed during runtime feature toggle checks, with logging involved.",
  "anomalies": "Use of inspect for call stack inspection in __getattribute__; verbose exception messages with undefined variables (e.g., 'not_declared', 'not_configured') indicating possible errors. No clear input validation beyond file existence. No malicious code evident in this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a data class for feature toggles, including lifecycle checks via __bool__. It loads configuration from a YAML source, either file or string. It verifies declared toggles against the configuration, raising exceptions for mismatches. Attribute access triggers logging of toggle checks, with inspection of call frames, possibly for debugging or auditing purposes. No code injection, data exfiltration, network operations, or obfuscated code present. There are some bugs, such as referencing undefined variables in exceptions, but these do not imply malicious intent. Overall, the code seems to serve a configuration management purpose without malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code primarily manages feature toggles with logging and validation. No evidence of malicious actions, data leakage, or sabotage is present. The inspection use is likely for audit/logging purposes. Minor bugs are present but do not indicate malicious intent.",
