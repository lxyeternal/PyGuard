{
  "purpose": "The code appears to manage feature toggles by reading configuration data from a YAML source, either from a file or a string, and provides access to toggle states with additional logging and validation.",
  "sources": "Reads data from a YAML file or string input during initialization (__init__). Accesses toggle attributes through __getattribute__, which logs information.",
  "sinks": "Logging output (via logging), which could potentially leak information if logs are exposed. No other immediate data leaks or external communications are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from YAML source to internal toggle objects; toggle attribute access flows through __getattribute__, which logs access events.",
  "anomalies": "Use of inspect to get current and outer frames primarily for logging. No suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as code injection or dynamic code execution, are evident. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets or suspicious imports.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a feature toggle system using data classes and YAML config input. It performs validation on declared toggles versus configured ones, raising exceptions if discrepancies exist. Logging is used for toggle checks. No evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or harmful behaviors. The only notable behavior is the detailed logging of toggle access, which is standard for debugging and monitoring.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a feature toggle system with validation and logging. There is no indication of malicious or sabotage behavior. It functions as a typical configuration management tool with standard logging practices.",
