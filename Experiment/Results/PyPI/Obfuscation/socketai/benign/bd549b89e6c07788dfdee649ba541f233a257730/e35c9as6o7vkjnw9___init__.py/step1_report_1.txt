  "purpose": "This code defines classes for managing feature toggles, including loading configurations from YAML files or strings and logging toggle checks.",
  "sources": "Reading input data from files (via 'document' parameter), loading YAML configurations, inspecting call stack frames.",
  "sinks": "Logging feature toggle checks, raising exceptions on configuration issues, setting class attributes dynamically.",
  "flows": "Loading YAML from file or string -> initializing toggle objects -> access to toggle attributes -> logging toggle checks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of inspect.getouterframes for logging; no suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns observed; exception handling is basic but standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages feature toggles with configuration validation and logging. It uses safe YAML loading (yaml.SafeLoader), avoiding code execution from YAML. No signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or system damage. Use of inspect for logging is benign and primarily for debugging or informational purposes. No hardcoded secrets or unusual obfuscation detected. Exception messages are generic, and the code structure is straightforward. Overall, the implementation appears legitimate, with standard practices for configuration management and logging.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a feature toggle management system with configuration validation and logging. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks identified. The overall security risk is low.",
