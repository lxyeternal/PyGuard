{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package called 'featuretoggles', including reading dependencies and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md', 'requirements.txt', 'test-requirements.txt', and environment variable 'TAG_NAME'.",
  "sinks": "Environment variable 'TAG_NAME' used in the package version; no direct sink of untrusted data or external communication.",
  "flows": "Reading files (sources) and passing data to setuptools.setup (sink). The environment variable influences versioning but does not affect execution flow beyond that.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variable 'TAG_NAME' for versioning could potentially be manipulated if an attacker controls the environment, but this is common in CI/CD pipelines.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily reads static files for the long description and dependencies, then calls setuptools.setup with package metadata. The environment variable 'TAG_NAME' is used for versioning, which is a standard practice in release automation. No suspicious code, obfuscated logic, or malicious behaviors are present. The code does not perform any network operations, data leaks, or malicious actions. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are detected. The code appears to be a typical setup script with no anomalies or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior. The use of environment variables for versioning is common and not inherently malicious. No security risks are detected based on this code alone.",
