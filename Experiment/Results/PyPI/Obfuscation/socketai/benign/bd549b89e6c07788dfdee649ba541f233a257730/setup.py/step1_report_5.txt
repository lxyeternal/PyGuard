{
  "purpose": "Set up a Python package named 'featuretoggles' with metadata, dependencies, and test configuration.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md', 'requirements.txt', and 'test-requirements.txt'; environment variable 'TAG_NAME'; package metadata.",
  "writers": "setuptools.setup() function which writes package metadata and configuration.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'TAG_NAME' (source) influences package version (sink); reading description and dependencies files (sources) used in setup configuration (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variable 'TAG_NAME' for versioning is standard; no suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors. Variable names are obfuscated but appear intentional and benign. No code injection, network activity, or data leaks detected.",
  "analysis": "The code reads multiple files for description and dependencies, which is typical for a setup script. It retrieves an environment variable 'TAG_NAME' for versioning, which is common in CI/CD pipelines. No suspicious code patterns, obfuscated logic, or malicious behaviors are present. The variable names appear intentionally obfuscated but are used solely within the setup context. No external network calls, credential storage, or malicious logic are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It properly reads files and uses environment variables in a typical manner. The obfuscated variable names do not indicate malicious intent but could hinder readability.",
