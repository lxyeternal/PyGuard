      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The package setup code is benign, with high obfuscation but no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation is likely cosmetic, and the environment variable usage is standard. Overall, the supply chain risk is minimal."

      "obfuscated": 0.8,
      "confidence": 0.85,
      "conclusion": "Most reports are accurately scored given their descriptions. The only nuanced case is report 4, where obfuscation and eval usage justify higher suspicion. Slightly increasing the malware score for report 4 from 0.4 to 0.5 improves alignment with observed patterns. Overall, the scores are consistent and appropriately reflect the security posture of each dependency."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate test suite for feature toggle validation, with no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. Obfuscation is limited and likely for code clarity or obfuscation practices, not malicious intent. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior."
