  "conclusion": "Most reports are accurately scored given their descriptions. The only nuanced case is report 4, where obfuscation and eval usage justify higher suspicion. Slightly increasing the malware score for report 4 from 0.4 to 0.5 improves alignment with observed patterns. Overall, the scores are consistent and appropriately reflect the security posture of each dependency."
