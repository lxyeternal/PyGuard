      "conclusion": "The core security issue is the unsafe SQL string formatting in the 'TWPjWJGkdRZfVZMYkgLRTdSZLscdKWXv' function, which interpolates 'pk_id' directly into SQL commands without parameterization, creating a risk of SQL injection. The code's purpose is legitimate, managing authentication keys, and no malware or malicious activity is detected. To mitigate the security risk, parameterized queries should be implemented. The overall assessment indicates a legitimate codebase with a notable security vulnerability that can be addressed with best practices."

The overall security risk is low, and the malware score should remain at 0. The obfuscation score reflects the difficulty in understanding the code but does not imply malicious activity."
