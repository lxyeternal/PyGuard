{
  "purpose": "Automates login, data retrieval, and file downloads from a financial website using web automation tools.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables for login credentials, input fields for date ranges, and interacts with webpage elements for navigation and download triggers.",
  "sinks": "Performs file downloads via Playwright's download handling, potentially saving files to specified directories.",
  "flows": "Credentials from environment variables → login form filling → navigation to data pages → triggering downloads → saving files.",
  "anomalies": "Uses sleep delays and retries to mimic human behavior; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation; dynamic URL and filename handling are standard for scraping.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward web automation script for data scraping, with no signs of malicious activity, payloads, or obfuscation. It employs environment variables for credentials, includes delays to avoid detection, and handles downloads securely. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The malware score is 0, consistent with the absence of malicious intent. The security risk score of 0.2 reflects low risk typical of scraping activities, justified by the use of delays and environment variables. The code's structure and behavior align with legitimate data collection purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate web automation tool for data scraping with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscation score of 0 are appropriate. The low security risk score of 0.2 is justified. No modifications to the scores are necessary.",
