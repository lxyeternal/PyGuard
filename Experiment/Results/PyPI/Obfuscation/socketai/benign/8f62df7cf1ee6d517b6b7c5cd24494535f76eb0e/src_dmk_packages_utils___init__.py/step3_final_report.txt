  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Input reading functions (e.g., input(), environment variables), data processing points, potential network or file sinks.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, subprocess calls, environment variable usage, dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input() or environment variables feed into processing functions, potentially reaching sinks like network or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected; code absent or straightforward in all reports.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate no actual code snippets are provided, relying on descriptions of benign behavior. Malware scores are consistently zero, obfuscation scores are zero, and security risk scores are very low (0.1-0.2). The confidence levels are high where code is described, and low where code is absent. Slight overestimation of risk in some reports (scores of 0.2) could be conservatively lowered to 0.1, aligning better with the benign assessments. Overall, the evaluations are consistent and justified given the evidence.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks detected. The current scores are appropriate; minor adjustments to risk scores in some reports could improve consistency, but overall, the assessments are sound.",
