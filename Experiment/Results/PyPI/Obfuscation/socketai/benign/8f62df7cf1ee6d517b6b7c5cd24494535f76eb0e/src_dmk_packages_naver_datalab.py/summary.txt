  "conclusion": "The core security issue is the unsafe SQL string formatting in the 'TWPjWJGkdRZfVZMYkgLRTdSZLscdKWXv' function, which interpolates 'pk_id' directly into SQL commands without parameterization, creating a risk of SQL injection. The code's purpose is legitimate, managing authentication keys, and no malware or malicious activity is detected. To mitigate the security risk, parameterized queries should be implemented. The overall assessment indicates a legitimate codebase with a notable security vulnerability that can be addressed with best practices."
