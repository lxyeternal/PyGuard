  "sources": "Dynamic code execution points (eval/exec), obfuscated variable names, network interactions, environment variable usage.",
  "sinks": "Potential data exfiltration, network connections, system modifications, or hidden malicious payloads.",
  "flows": "Sources like eval/exec or obfuscated variables leading to network communication or system commands.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation, dynamic code execution, inconsistent variable naming, suspicious network domains, hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits obfuscation and dynamic execution features, which are common indicators of malicious intent but are also used in legitimate complex scripts. No explicit malicious payloads such as data exfiltration, system damage, or unauthorized network connections are confirmed. The presence of obfuscation and dynamic code suggests potential concealment, warranting cautious scoring. Scores are adjusted to reflect suspicion levels: malware score increased to 0.4 for reports with dynamic eval/exec, obfuscation scores around 0.4-0.5 where obfuscation is significant, and security risk around 0.3-0.4 to account for potential hidden malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic features but lacks concrete evidence of malicious payloads. The adjusted scores better reflect the suspicion level without overestimating risk. Further static and dynamic analysis is recommended for confirmation.",
