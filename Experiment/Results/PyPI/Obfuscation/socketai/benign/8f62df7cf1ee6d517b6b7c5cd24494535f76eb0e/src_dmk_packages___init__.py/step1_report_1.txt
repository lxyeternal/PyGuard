  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be a basic utility script for handling data processing or network communication, but the specific intent is unclear without further context.",
  "sources": "Input sources include reading from environment variables, reading files, and user input via function calls or command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks involve network connections, file writes, or system commands that could be exploited if untrusted data is passed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions, potentially passing untrusted data into network sockets, file outputs, or system calls.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. No unusual dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors are detected. The structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code reads data from environment variables and user inputs, processes it through functions, and possibly outputs or transmits it. No malicious or suspicious code patterns such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or credential theft are identified. Usage of third-party libraries is standard. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious network activity is evident. The code appears benign and functional, with no anomalies that suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose without obfuscated or malicious features.",
