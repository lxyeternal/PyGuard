{
  "purpose": "Automates login, navigation, and data filtering on a news website using Playwright, with credentials from environment variables.",
  "sources": "Reads login credentials from environment variables; interacts with webpage elements for login and data selection.",
  "sinks": "Webpage interactions; no network exfiltration or data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "Source: environment variables for credentials -> webpage form filling and clicking actions -> webpage navigation and data filtering.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names; no hardcoded secrets; standard web automation patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs legitimate web automation tasks: logging into a site, setting date filters, selecting categories, and initiating analysis. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. Obfuscation appears to be for concealment or proprietary reasons, not malicious intent. The use of environment variables for credentials is appropriate. The high obfuscation scores are justified given the naming conventions. No hardcoded secrets or malicious behaviors are evident. The overall structure and behavior align with benign automation scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate web automation script with obfuscation that does not indicate malicious intent. The scores are consistent with the observed behavior, with malware score at 0, obfuscation score justified at around 0.7, and low security risk score at 0.2.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.7,
