  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Code snippet under review:**\n```python\nfrom .hnt_sap import *\n```\n\n---\n\n### General observations:\n- The code is a simple relative import of all contents from the module `.hnt_sap`.\n- No additional logic, data handling, or network activity is present.\n- The import uses a wildcard (`*`), which is generally discouraged but not inherently malicious.\n- The security implications depend entirely on the contents of `hnt_sap`, which are not provided.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly states it's a basic import; no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 0.6 (moderate)\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (low)\n- **Verdict:** Accurate; no issues. The report appropriately notes that further analysis of `hnt_sap` is needed.\n- **Score suggestion:** Keep as is.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Highlights the use of wildcard import and notes it's common but discouraged.\n- **Confidence:** 0.7 (higher confidence)\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n- **Verdict:** Correct; no malicious activity is evident. The use of `*` is noted as poor practice but not malicious.\n- **Score suggestion:** Keep as is.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to others, emphasizes minimal code and no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 (high confidence)\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low)\n- **Verdict:** Accurate; no issues based solely on this import statement.\n- **Score suggestion:** Keep as is.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Recognizes that the import could hide malicious code within `hnt_sap` but notes that the import itself is benign.\n- **Confidence:** 0.3 (low)\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate caution is advised, but no evidence of malicious activity in the snippet.\n- **Score suggestion:** Keep as is.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly points out that wildcard imports can obscure malicious code, but the import itself isn't malicious.\n- **Confidence:** 0.6\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable; further review of `hnt_sap` is recommended, but the snippet is not malicious.\n- **Score suggestion:** Keep as is.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious activity in this import statement.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly varied but generally low, reflecting the minimal code and the need for further analysis of the imported module.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- The key concern is the use of wildcard import, which can hide malicious code if the imported module is compromised, but this cannot be confirmed from the snippet alone.\n- Given the absence of any signs of malware or obfuscation, I agree with the current scores.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (low, mainly due to the wildcard import pattern and dependency trust)\n\n**Conclusion:** The import statement itself appears benign. The primary security concern is the trustworthiness of the `hnt_sap` module, which cannot be assessed here. No changes to scores are necessary based on the provided information.",
