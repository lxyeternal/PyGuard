  "purpose": "Import all functions, classes, and variables from the local module 'hnt_sap'.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing from a local module within the package.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network, file, or environment variable access observed.",
  "flows": "The import may allow access to potentially malicious or compromised code from 'hnt_sap', but no explicit data flow is shown here.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('*') can obscure what is being imported and may hide malicious code if present in 'hnt_sap'. The code snippet alone is minimal and does not reveal malicious behavior but the use of wildcard import can be considered suspicious as it reduces code clarity and may be used to hide malicious functions.",
  "analysis": "The code only performs a single import operation from a relative module. There are no apparent data inputs, network operations, or suspicious behavior directly visible in this snippet. The use of wildcard import ('*') is generally discouraged as it can import hidden or malicious code without explicit declaration. Without inspecting the 'hnt_sap' module itself, we cannot determine if it contains malicious code, but the pattern of import alone is not inherently malicious. Overall, this code snippet alone is benign but warrants caution if the imported module is unknown or untrusted.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard import with no immediate malicious indicators. However, the use of wildcard import can hide malicious code within the 'hnt_sap' module, so further review of that module is recommended. The current snippet does not show malicious behavior but should be considered with context.",
