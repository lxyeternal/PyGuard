  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the provided information, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: `from .hnt_sap import *`.\n- The code is minimal, only an import statement.\n- No direct signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or data flow are evident from this snippet alone.\n- The main concern is the use of wildcard import (`*`), which can hide imported functions or classes, potentially including malicious code if the module is compromised.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Import all from `.hnt_sap`.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious intent, no anomalies.\n- **Confidence:** 0.6\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The low confidence reflects uncertainty about the module's contents, but the import itself is benign.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** Highlights the use of wildcard import, which can be risky but is common.\n- **Confidence:** 0.7\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly higher confidence due to the concern about wildcard import. The risk score of 0 seems appropriate since the import alone isn't malicious.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Same.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity, only an import.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0.1, risk=0.1\n\n**Assessment:** The malware score remains 0, which is correct. Obfuscation is minimal, so 0.1 is acceptable. The risk score is low, which is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Same.\n- **Analysis:** Same reasoning, emphasizes that the module's content is unknown.\n- **Confidence:** 0.3\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n**Assessment:** The low confidence is justified given the limited context. The risk score is appropriately low.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Same.\n- **Analysis:** Recognizes that wildcard import can hide malicious code, recommends further review.\n- **Confidence:** 0.6\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The concern about potential malicious code in the imported module is valid, but without evidence, the malware score remains 0.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of scoring consistency:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated:** All assign 0 or very low, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly varies but remains low (0.1-0.2), reflecting the minimal risk based solely on this import statement.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The **risk scores** are reasonable given the limited context.\n- The **malware scores** are correctly set to 0; no evidence of malicious code is present.\n- The **obfuscated scores** are appropriate.\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (low, mainly due to wildcard import potential risk)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate based on the provided snippet. The primary concern is the use of wildcard import, which warrants further review of the `hnt_sap` module itself, but the import statement alone is not malicious or suspicious.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always review the contents of `hnt_sap` for malicious or unintended code, especially if the module is untrusted or from an external source.",
