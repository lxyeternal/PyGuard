{
  "purpose": "The code imports all functions and classes from the module 'hnt_sap' within the same package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local package (relative import). No external input or data sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this single line of code; no data processing, output, or external communication occurs here.",
  "flows": "No data flow can be determined from this single import statement alone.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a wildcard import which can obscure what is imported, potentially hiding malicious or unintended code. However, this is a common pattern in package initialization files.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a relative import from the module 'hnt_sap'. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or unusual code activity. Since it's only an import statement, there are no apparent security risks or malicious actions within this snippet. The use of 'from .hnt_sap import *' might be discouraged for clarity and maintainability but does not directly indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward relative import from a module named 'hnt_sap'. There is no indication of malicious behavior or security risk based on this line alone. The import pattern might be considered poor practice for clarity but is not inherently malicious.",
