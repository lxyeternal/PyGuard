  "purpose": "Import all contents from the local module '.hnt_sap' using a wildcard import.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no other data sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present in this snippet; potential concern is the imported module's contents.",
  "flows": "The import loads all symbols from '.hnt_sap' into the current namespace; no direct data flow or malicious activity observable here.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('*'), which can obscure imported symbols and potentially hide malicious functions or variables if the module is compromised.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple relative import of all symbols from the '.hnt_sap' module. No embedded code, network activity, or obfuscation is visible. The security implications depend on the contents of 'hnt_sap', which are not provided. The wildcard import is generally discouraged as it reduces code clarity and can hide malicious functions if the module is malicious. The malware score is set to 0, reflecting no evidence of malicious intent in this snippet. The risk score is low (around 0.2), primarily due to the potential risk if 'hnt_sap' contains malicious code, but this cannot be confirmed here. The obfuscation score is 0, as the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement itself appears benign; no signs of malware or obfuscation are present. The primary concern is the trustworthiness of the 'hnt_sap' module, which cannot be assessed from this snippet. The scores are appropriate given the limited context, with a low malware and obfuscation score and a minimal risk score. Further review of 'hnt_sap' is recommended to ensure it does not contain malicious code, but based solely on this import, the code is safe.",
