  "conclusion": "The import statement itself appears benign; no signs of malware or obfuscation are present. The primary concern is the trustworthiness of the 'hnt_sap' module, which cannot be assessed from this snippet. The scores are appropriate given the limited context, with a low malware and obfuscation score and a minimal risk score. Further review of 'hnt_sap' is recommended to ensure it does not contain malicious code, but based solely on this import, the code is safe."
