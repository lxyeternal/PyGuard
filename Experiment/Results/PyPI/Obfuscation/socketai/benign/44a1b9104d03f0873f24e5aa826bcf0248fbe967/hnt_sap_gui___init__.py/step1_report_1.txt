  "sinks": "No direct sinks; however, imported code could be executed or used elsewhere in the package.",
  "flows": "Not directly observable in this snippet; potential flow depends on how imported contents are used elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "The import statement alone is minimal and does not exhibit any anomalies or suspicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement importing everything from a module named '.hnt_sap'. There are no signs of malicious intent, no suspicious code patterns, and no embedded secrets or obfuscation present. Without additional context or code execution, this appears to be a standard import statement. It is important to review the contents of 'hnt_sap' separately for malicious behavior, but based solely on this line, there is no evidence of malware or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This is a basic import statement with no immediate signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply includes the module '.hnt_sap'. Further analysis should be conducted on the contents of 'hnt_sap' to ensure it is safe.",
