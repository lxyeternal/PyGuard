  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from the module '.hnt_sap', likely part of a larger package or project.",

  "sinks": "None directly visible; no data outputs, network connections, or sensitive operations shown",
  "flows": "No data flows are visible in this snippet; it only performs an import",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative import without context; no suspicious code or unusual constructs are present",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a single import statement using a relative import syntax. There are no other operations, no data handling, network activity, or embedded code that could indicate malicious behavior. Because this is only an import statement with no additional logic, there are no evident security issues, malware, or anomalies. The snippet is minimal and does not provide enough context to suggest malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger package, and without additional context, there are no concerns based on this snippet alone.",
