{
  "purpose": "Import all functions, classes, or variables from the local module 'hnt_sap'.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself is a source, but no runtime data input is evident in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this single import statement; it does not handle untrusted data or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow is observable from this minimal code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is extremely minimal; reliance on a local module could be normal, but it could also conceal malicious content if the module is malicious. No other anomalies are evident here.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports a module named 'hnt_sap' from the current package. Without further context or content of 'hnt_sap', no malicious behavior can be determined. The import itself is standard in Python, but it could potentially load malicious code if the 'hnt_sap' module is compromised. Since the snippet is very limited, analysis is constrained to the import statement alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no immediate signs of malicious behavior. Its security implications depend entirely on the contents of the 'hnt_sap' module, which cannot be assessed here. No malware or malicious activity can be confirmed based on this line alone.",
