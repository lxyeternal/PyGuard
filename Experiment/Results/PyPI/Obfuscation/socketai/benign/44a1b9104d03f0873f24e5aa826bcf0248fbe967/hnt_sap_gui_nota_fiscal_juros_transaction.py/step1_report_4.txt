  "purpose": "Automates SAP GUI interactions to process financial transactions involving 'juros' and document generation.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from 'nota_pedido' dictionary, 'miro' dictionary, and SAP GUI input fields.",
  "sinks": "Interacts with SAP GUI session to send keystrokes and set field values; extracts status messages from SAP GUI.",
  "flows": "Inputs from 'nota_pedido' and 'miro' -> SAP GUI transaction and data entry -> SAP system response -> log extraction and pattern matching.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names, dynamic pattern matching, and logging statements; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs SAP GUI automation for financial data entry, including setting transaction data, posting entries, and retrieving a confirmation message. It uses dynamic regex to extract document numbers and processes the result through functions that may analyze or store this data. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or malicious system manipulations are present. Variable names and logging are obfuscated but do not suggest malicious intent. The code appears to serve a legitimate automation purpose without malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a legitimate SAP automation routine with obfuscated variable names and pattern matching, but no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The overall security risk appears low.",
