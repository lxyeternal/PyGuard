  "conclusion": "The code shows no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. Obfuscation is moderate to high but appears intentional for code protection rather than malicious concealment. The overall security risk is low. Attention should be given to external dependencies and code maintainability, but current evidence does not warrant suspicion of malware."
