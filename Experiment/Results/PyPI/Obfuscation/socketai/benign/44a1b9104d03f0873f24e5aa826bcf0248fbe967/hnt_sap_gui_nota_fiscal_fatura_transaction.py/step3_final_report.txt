{
  "purpose": "Automates SAP GUI transaction for invoice processing, including data entry, validation, and error handling.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from fatura dictionary, session status messages, and GUI elements for validation.",
  "sinks": "Session interactions such as setting text fields, clicking buttons, and reading status bar messages.",
  "flows": "Data is read from input, entered into GUI fields, status messages are checked for errors, and exceptions are raised if needed.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable, class, and method names; regex patterns for message matching; no network or file activity; no hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code performs SAP GUI automation with obfuscated identifiers, using regex to interpret status messages and handle errors. It inputs invoice data, validates messages, and proceeds through transaction steps. No external communication, network activity, or malicious payloads are present. Obfuscation is notable but not evidence of malicious intent. Error handling is standard, raising exceptions on specific messages. The overall behavior aligns with legitimate automation scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate SAP GUI automation script with high obfuscation, likely for concealment but without malicious behavior. No signs of malware, backdoors, or sabotage are evident. The security risk is low, and the malware score is zero. Obfuscation is high but not necessarily malicious. The current scores are appropriate, with a slight adjustment to obfuscated score around 0.7-0.8 to reflect the obfuscation level, and the security risk remains at 0.2.",
