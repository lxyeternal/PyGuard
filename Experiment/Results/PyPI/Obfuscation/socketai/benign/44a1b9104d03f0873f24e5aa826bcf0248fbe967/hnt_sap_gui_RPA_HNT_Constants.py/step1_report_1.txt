  "purpose": "The code appears to define two variables with base64-encoded string values, potentially used as hardcoded credentials or tokens.",
  "sources": "The two variable assignments that assign static string values to variables.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling observed; no network or file operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; variables are assigned static values without further processing.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of base64-encoded strings assigned to variables; no decoding or usage shown, which could indicate obfuscation or hidden intent.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two variable assignments with seemingly arbitrary strings that resemble base64-encoded data. No decoding, network activity, or further logic is present. The strings could be placeholders or deliberately encoded secrets. The minimal code and lack of context prevent definitive conclusions, but the pattern raises suspicion of hidden or malicious intent if these are used as secrets or tokens. There are no signs of obfuscation beyond the encoded strings, nor any malicious behavior detected in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of variable assignments with encoded strings. While there are no active malicious actions or data flows, the presence of encoded strings could suggest obfuscation or hidden data, warranting further context to fully assess intent. Overall, the snippet alone does not indicate malicious behavior but raises minor concerns about hidden secrets.",
