{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define two variables with base64-encoded string values, potentially for later decoding or use.",
  "sources": "The variables are assigned static string literals, which are hardcoded in the source code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as network connections, file writes, or eval functions are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The source is the assignment of hardcoded strings; no flow to sinks is visible within this code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The strings appear to be base64-like encoded data, but there are no further operations shown. No decoding, data transmission, or other suspicious activity is evident. The variables are named with random strings, which could be obfuscation, but this alone is not conclusive.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet contains two variable assignments with seemingly encoded string values. Without additional context, such as decoding or usage, these appear to be static data placeholders. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscation techniques beyond the use of encoded strings. The code is minimal and does not execute any functions, network activity, or system modifications. Based solely on this fragment, it is not malicious or suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment appears benign. It assigns obfuscated-looking strings to variables without further actions. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks evident in this snippet.",
