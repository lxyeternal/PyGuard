  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for error handling with optional cause information.",
  "sources": "The class accepts input parameters 'message' and 'cause' during initialization.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any direct sinks that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow from instantiation to the string representation, but no external data flow or untrusted source handling is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior are present. The class is a straightforward custom exception.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class inheriting from Exception, with an initializer that accepts a message and an optional cause. The __str__ method provides a formatted string for the exception, including the cause if present. The __cause__ method returns the stored cause. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues. The class is typical for error handling in Python.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign custom exception class with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
