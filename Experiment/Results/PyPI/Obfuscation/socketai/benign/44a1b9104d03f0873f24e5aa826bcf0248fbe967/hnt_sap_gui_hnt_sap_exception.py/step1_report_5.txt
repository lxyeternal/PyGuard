  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class with optional cause information for error handling.",
  "sources": "None (no input or data reading present in the code).",
  "sinks": "None (no data leakage, system modification, or other side effects present).",
  "flows": "Not applicable (no data flows; class definition only).",
  "anomalies": "The class name and exception message are obfuscated or non-descriptive, which may hinder understanding but does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class 'uLbVQoiEJhSbGhAGQxNeQjeSQGuAtmYw' inheriting from Exception. It has an initializer that accepts a message and an optional cause, and a string representation method that formats the exception message, including cause if provided. The '__cause__' method returns the cause attribute. No external data sources, network calls, or suspicious behaviors are present. The obfuscated class name may be a form of code hiding but does not itself imply malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward custom exception class with obfuscated naming but no malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies. It does not perform any harmful operations or contain malicious payloads.",
