{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for error handling with optional cause information",
  "sources": "The class reads input through its constructor parameters 'message' and 'cause'",
  "sinks": "The class does not contain any sinks or data flows that lead to data leakage or security vulnerabilities",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows present",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class inheriting from Exception. It initializes with a message and optional cause, provides a string representation that includes cause details if present, and defines a method to return the cause. All methods perform standard exception handling operations with no external interactions or malicious constructs. The code structure and naming appear normal, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward custom exception class with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It solely manages exception data internally without any external security risks.",
