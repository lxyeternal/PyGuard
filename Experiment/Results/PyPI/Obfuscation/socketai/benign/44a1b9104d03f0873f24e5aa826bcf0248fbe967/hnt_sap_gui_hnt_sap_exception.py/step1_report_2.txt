  "purpose": "Custom exception class definition for error handling with optional cause information",
  "sources": "The class takes 'message' and optional 'cause' as input parameters during initialization",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed or outputted; the class only manages internal string representations",
  "flows": "Input parameters 'message' and 'cause' are stored as instance variables; __str__ method formats these for output",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class inheriting from Exception. It initializes with a message and optional cause, providing a string representation that includes both if available. The __cause__ method returns the cause, aligning with Python exception practices. There are no suspicious patterns, external data flows, or malicious constructs present. The class appears standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward custom exception class with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely for error handling purposes.",
