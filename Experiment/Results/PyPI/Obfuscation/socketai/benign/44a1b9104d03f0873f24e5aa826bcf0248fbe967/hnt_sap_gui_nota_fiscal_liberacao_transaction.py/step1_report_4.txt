{
  "purpose": "The code interacts with a SAP GUI session to execute a transaction, input data, and retrieve a specific label text, likely for automation purposes.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'codigo_pedido' used in 'findById' to set a value in the SAP GUI session.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; data is read from the SAP session and logged, no external data leaks or harmful actions detected.",
  "flows": "codigo_pedido (source) is used to set a value in the SAP session, which may influence subsequent SAP transaction behavior.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names makes code less readable and potentially suspicious. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. No dynamic code execution or network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a class method that automates SAP GUI interactions: opening a transaction, setting input fields, pressing buttons, and retrieving a label's text. Variable names are intentionally obscured, which is uncommon in clean code but not inherently malicious. The process appears to be straightforward automation with no malicious indicators such as network communication, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The logging of retrieved values is standard practice for debugging or tracking.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard SAP GUI automation with obfuscated variable names. No signs of malicious behavior or malware are detected. The obscurity may hinder maintainability but does not indicate malicious intent.",
