  "purpose": "Setup script for Python package, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Assignment of string 'nota_fiscal' to variable 'gNdxPsflMuAPEhuGmOuVUQSkWBfzOwMo=' which is not used elsewhere.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, no network connections, no code execution or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Variable assignment 'gNdxPsflMuAPEhuGmOuVUQSkWBfzOwMo=' to 'nota_fiscal' remains unused; no data flow leading to malicious sink.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable name and assignment of a string 'nota_fiscal' that is not utilized, suggesting obfuscation or misdirection.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with an obfuscated variable name and an unused string assignment. No dynamic code, network activity, or malicious behavior is present. The variable name and package name are suspicious but do not execute or leak data. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0.2-0.3, risk=0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The obfuscation appears superficial, possibly for misdirection, but does not constitute malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The package setup code is benign with signs of superficial obfuscation. No evidence of malicious activity, supply chain attack, or data exfiltration. The low malware and risk scores are appropriate. Further review should focus on the context of usage, but based solely on this code, it is safe.",
