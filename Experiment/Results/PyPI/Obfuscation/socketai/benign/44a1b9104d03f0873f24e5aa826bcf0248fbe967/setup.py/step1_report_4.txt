  "purpose": "Configure and set up a Python package with specific metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata, hardcoded string for license, package_data entries, and install_requires list.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or code execution; no external data input/output observed.",
  "flows": "The setup configuration reads static data; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a nonsensical string 'gNdxPsflMuAPEhuGmOuVUQSkWBfzOwMo=' assigned to 'nota_fiscal', which appears as a random or obfuscated string but is not used elsewhere; the package name 'i5808s8r026gnehc' is unconventional and possibly obfuscated or intentionally obscure. No other suspicious code or behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to define a package. The only unusual element is a string 'gNdxPsflMuAPEhuGmOuVUQSkWBfzOwMo=' assigned to 'nota_fiscal', which does not affect setup or dependencies and is likely benign. The package name and version are arbitrary and do not indicate malicious intent. No dynamic code execution, input handling, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a typical setup configuration with some unconventional naming and an extraneous string that does not influence package behavior. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks.",
