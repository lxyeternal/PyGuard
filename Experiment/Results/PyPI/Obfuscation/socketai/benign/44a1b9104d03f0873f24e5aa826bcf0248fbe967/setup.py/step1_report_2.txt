  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'i5808s8r026gnehc' including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "The 'setup.py' script reads static strings for package name, version, license, package data, and install requirements. The variable 'gNdxPsflMuAPEhuGmOuVUQSkWBfzOwMo=' appears to be a hardcoded string.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks such as network or file output. However, hardcoded strings and package metadata are present, with no indication of malicious data handling.",
  "flows": "The static data flows from variable declarations into the setup() function parameters. There are no dynamic or external input flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "The variable 'gNdxPsflMuAPEhuGmOuVUQSkWBfzOwMo=' is a non-descriptive, seemingly random string assigned to 'nota_fiscal', which could suggest obfuscation or hidden intent. The package name appears intentionally obscure, which can be suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration with typical fields such as name, version, license, package data, and dependencies. The only anomaly is the obfuscated variable name assigned to what seems to be a string identifier. No code execution, external data handling, or suspicious behaviors are present. The overall structure indicates a legitimate setup script, but the obscure variable name warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard 'setup.py' configuration with an unusual variable name that could be a red flag. No malicious behavior or malicious code is detected. The package metadata itself is not suspicious, but the obfuscated variable name should be scrutinized further if possible.",
