{
  "purpose": "Automated SAP transaction processing, including data entry, validation, and status checks for invoice and NFe processing.",
  "sources": "Input data from 'data', 'numero_pedido', and environment/session variables; reading status bar messages and UI element texts.",
  "sinks": "SAP GUI interface interactions such as setting text fields, clicking buttons, navigating tabs, and reading status messages; raising exceptions based on status messages.",
  "flows": "Input data -> UI element interactions (setting texts, clicking buttons) -> Status bar/message analysis -> Exception raising or final processing.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable and class names, dynamic UI interactions with multiple calls to 'findById', extensive use of string matching with regex patterns for status detection, raising exceptions based on status messages.",
  "analysis": "The code automates SAP GUI transactions, setting various fields with input data, navigating through tabs, and handling UI messages. It uses obfuscated names and regex patterns to parse status messages, raising exceptions on error conditions. The interactions are typical for automation scripts. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious network activity is detected. The use of dynamic UI element IDs and regex for message parsing is consistent with automation but could obscure malicious intent. However, no evidence of malicious actions such as data exfiltration, system damage, or unauthorized network communication is present.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a complex SAP GUI automation tool for invoice and NFe processing, with obfuscated variable names. It performs standard UI interactions, validation, and error handling. No malicious behavior or supply chain attacks are evident from the code. The obfuscation and extensive UI automation may hide malicious intent, but based on the available code, it appears to be a legitimate automation script.",
