  "purpose": "Automates SAP GUI transaction for processing invoices and related data validation and logging.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration and input data from the 'data' dictionary, including 'dados_basicos', 'pagamento', 'detalhe', 'sintese', and 'dados_nfe'. Uses hardcoded strings for SAP GUI element IDs and regex patterns for log parsing.",
  "sinks": "Interacts with SAP GUI via method calls such as 'run_transaction', 'send_vkey', and direct element manipulation. Reads status messages from the SAP session bar and raises exceptions based on certain message patterns. Logs information using a logger.",
  "flows": "Source: Input data (e.g., 'data' dict, regex matches). Sink: SAP GUI interactions and exception raising based on session messages and regex pattern matches. Data flows from input parameters into SAP GUI fields, then status messages are checked to detect errors.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names throughout; no clear documentation or comments. Regex patterns are hardcoded and generic, not suspicious on their own. Exception handling for read-only fields or message pattern matching may suppress errors without clear validation logic. No hardcoded credentials or network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a sequence of SAP GUI interactions: starting transactions, filling in data, handling pop-up messages, and checking status messages. Regex patterns are used for parsing messages indicating errors or specific statuses. It raises exceptions for known error patterns, logs messages, and processes invoice-related data. No obfuscated code techniques or malicious network behavior are evident. The code appears to be an automation script with specific purpose, with no signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system sabotage. The variable naming suggests obfuscation, but this is typical for internal code. No suspicious external calls or hidden data leaks are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as an automation script for SAP GUI invoice processing. It performs legitimate actions with input data, includes error handling based on session messages, and logs status. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks within this code segment.",
