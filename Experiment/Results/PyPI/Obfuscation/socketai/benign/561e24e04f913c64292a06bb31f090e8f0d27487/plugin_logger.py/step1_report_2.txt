  "purpose": "Custom logging class extending Python's Logger, with added methods for different log levels and optional data reporting to a REST API or via socket.io.",
  "sources": "Reading input from method parameters such as msg and args, especially in GOKkZGoukVVGsKFYfFJmUfQQCNshquGy, and data from object attributes like apiKey, plugin, session, org_id, plugin_id.",
  "sinks": "Sending data via socket.io emit or REST API request, potentially transmitting sensitive information such as apiKey, session, org_id, plugin_id, and log messages.",
  "flows": "Log message and context data (msg, args, attributes) are processed in GOKkZGoukVVGsKFYfFJmUfQQCNshquGy, then either emitted over socket.io or sent via REST API, possibly leaking sensitive info.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a class name with seemingly random characters, obfuscated style method names, concatenation of msg with args, conditional API communication based on 'connector'. The import from 'imerit_ango.sdk' suggests external SDK usage, possibly for data transmission.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom logger with methods for logging at different levels. The GOKkZGoukVVGsKFYfFJmUfQQCNshquGy method compiles a dictionary with log details, including sensitive data (apiKey, session, org_id, plugin_id). It then either emits this data via socket.io or sends it to a REST API endpoint. The function's structure and naming pattern, including randomized method names, suggest obfuscation. Data containing sensitive credentials can be transmitted externally, posing privacy/security risks. No explicit malicious commands like file access or system modification are present, but potential data leakage exists.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily functions as a custom logger that transmits log data, potentially sensitive, to external systems via socket.io or REST API. The obfuscated style and transmission of sensitive info could be exploited for data exfiltration, raising security concerns. No direct malware or backdoors are evident, but privacy risks are significant.",
