  "sinks": "Remote server via REST API call using apikey; socket.io emit ('log') with message data.",

  "anomalies": [
    "Use of hardcoded string 'WARNING', 'ERROR', 'DEBUG', 'INFO' as log levels (possibly intended but not suspicious).",
    "Concatenation of msg with args directly in message (potential data leakage if msg or args contain sensitive info).",
    "In GOKkZGoukVVGsKFYfFJmUfQQCNshquGy(), when connector == 'REST', an object is instantiated with an apikey, which could be sensitive if exposed.",

    "Potential for leakage of apikey in network call if the apikey is sensitive (hard to determine if secret)."
  ],
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom logger class inheriting from Python's logging.Logger. It initializes with parameters including apikey and plugin info. The class contains methods for logging at different levels that internally call a private method GOKkZGoukVVGsKFYfFJmUfQQCNshquGy(), which either sends data via REST API or socket.io emit. When the connector is REST, it creates an object with the apikey, which might expose sensitive data if logs are not sanitized. The code does not perform obfuscation or concealment. The use of potentially sensitive parameters (apikey, session, org_id) in network communications is notable. The code appears to be a flexible logging mechanism, with no direct signs of malicious behavior, but potential data leakage risks if sensitive info is logged or sent unencrypted.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a custom logging class capable of transmitting logs via network or socket.io. While it does not contain explicit malicious code, it handles sensitive parameters such as API keys and session info, which could lead to data leakage if misused. The structure and naming are unusual but do not inherently indicate malware. Overall, the code appears to be a standard logging utility with some potential security considerations regarding sensitive data transmission.",
