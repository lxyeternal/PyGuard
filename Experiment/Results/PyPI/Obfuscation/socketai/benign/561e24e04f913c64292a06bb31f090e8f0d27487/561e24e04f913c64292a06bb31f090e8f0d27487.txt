      "confidence": 0.3,
      "conclusion": "Given the absence of code, all reports should maintain low confidence levels (~0.2–0.3), with malware and obfuscated scores at 0. The security risk scores are appropriate but could be marginally reduced to reflect uncertainty. The current high confidence in some reports is unjustified and should be corrected to prevent overestimation of benignity. Overall, the supply chain risk remains minimal, but assessments must be cautious and evidence-based."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a complex, obfuscated plugin framework with extensive network communication capabilities. While suspicious in structure—particularly due to obfuscation and external SDKs—there is no definitive evidence of malicious activity such as data theft or system compromise from the provided snippets. The high obfuscation and network activity suggest potential for malicious use, but confirmation requires further dynamic analysis and SDK review."

      "conclusion": "The code is a sophisticated, possibly obfuscated SDK for project management APIs. It does not exhibit signs of active malware or malicious sabotage but contains structural irregularities, incomplete variables, and insecure practices that warrant cautious review before deployment. The malware score is low, obfuscation moderate, and overall security risk moderate."

Its design warrants caution, with moderate to high security risk and a high likelihood of obfuscation. The malware score is set to 0.6, reflecting suspicion of malicious intent, and the overall security risk is 0.7."

The obfuscation score is moderate (~0.2-0.3), justified by the naming conventions. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use in production environments, assuming source trustworthiness."

The reports lack detailed findings; thus, the overall security risk is moderate primarily due to potential credential leakage. Scores should reflect low malware and obfuscation but a higher risk score (~0.7) due to data exposure."

The obfuscation is likely due to code generation or protective measures rather than malicious intent. The malware score is 0, the obfuscated score is approximately 0.75, and the security risk score is low (~0.2)."
