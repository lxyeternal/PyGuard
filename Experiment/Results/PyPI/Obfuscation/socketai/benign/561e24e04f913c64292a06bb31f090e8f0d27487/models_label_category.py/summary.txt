  "conclusion": "The code is a complex but benign schema/configuration utility with heavy obfuscation but no malicious intent. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code injection. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2). The obfuscation score is moderate (~0.2-0.3), justified by the naming conventions. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use in production environments, assuming source trustworthiness."
