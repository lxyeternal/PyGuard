{
  "purpose": "Defines enums, classes, and utility functions for schema configuration and data management, primarily for form or data structure schemas.",
  "sources": "Class initializers, uuid.uuid4().hex for IDs, random.choice for color codes, input parameters for class constructors.",
  "sinks": "UUID generation, random color code generation, deep copies for data serialization.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through class attributes into nested data structures; no external data flows or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with nonsensical class and variable names; use of random functions for color and ID generation is standard but contributes to obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages nested data schemas with utility functions for serialization and unique ID generation. No network activity, file I/O, or command execution is present. The use of random UUIDs and color codes is typical for configuration data. The obfuscation appears to be stylistic or for code compression, not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns are detected. The code's purpose is benign schema management, and the logic is straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a complex but benign schema/configuration utility with heavy obfuscation but no malicious intent. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code injection. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2). The obfuscation score is moderate (~0.2-0.3), justified by the naming conventions. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use in production environments, assuming source trustworthiness.",
