  "conclusion": "Given the absence of code, all reports should maintain low confidence levels (~0.2–0.3), with malware and obfuscated scores at 0. The security risk scores are appropriate but could be marginally reduced to reflect uncertainty. The current high confidence in some reports is unjustified and should be corrected to prevent overestimation of benignity. Overall, the supply chain risk remains minimal, but assessments must be cautious and evidence-based."
