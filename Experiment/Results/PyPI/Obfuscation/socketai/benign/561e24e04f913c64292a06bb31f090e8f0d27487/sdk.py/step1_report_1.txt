  "raw_response": "{\n  \"purpose\": \"This code appears to be a Python client SDK for interacting with an API related to project management, asset handling, and storage operations, with methods for uploading files, managing tasks, projects, and organizational data.\",\n  \"sources\": \"The code reads data from method parameters, external API responses via HTTP requests, and local files (in 'import_labels' and 'owxliNkpWgOvMxmmWYSjxKiZSXqhlFzC' functions). It also reads files from disk during asset uploads.\",\n  \"sinks\": \"Untrusted data could reach sinks via HTTP requests to external API endpoints, particularly in request.request(), session.get(), session.post(), and session.put() calls. File downloads and URL retrievals also serve as sinks for external data.\",\n  \"flows\": \"Data flows from input parameters or local files (sources) into HTTP request payloads or URLs, and responses from the API (including URLs, JSON data, or file contents) are processed and possibly returned or stored locally.\",\n  \"anomalies\": \"The code contains inconsistent or placeholder variables such as 'project_id' which are undefined within the class, potentially indicating incomplete or obfuscated code. The method 'zmSUhgHXfdwpYjxuRiLYyXKbDlHUvRem' constructs a URL with double slashes and a variable 'project_id' that is not defined. Also, there are suspicious string patterns, e.g., raising exceptions with string literals, and some variable names that seem auto-generated or obfuscated, which might be an attempt to hide malicious intent. The code uses open() without context management in 'HhEVQoGQeVmCnuSTvfSxtczpvxPIVgTl', and there is an inconsistent raising of strings as exceptions (e.g., 'raise \"Storage ID is Invalid!\"'). The code includes file handling and requests with potential for file or data exfiltration if misused. Also, the presence of multiple import statements from 'imerit_ango' modules suggests reliance on external or proprietary libraries; if those contain malicious code, it would be outside this analysis scope, but their usage in this context does not appear inherently suspicious.\",\n  \"analysis\": \"The code is a Python client class designed for interacting with a RESTful API, with various methods for project, task, storage, and asset management. The code constructs API URLs, manages session requests, handles files and uploads, and processes JSON data. It contains some inconsistent and possibly incomplete parts, such as undefined variables ('project_id') used in URL constructions, and placeholder or obfuscated method names. The logic flow from sources (inputs, files, responses) to sinks (HTTP requests, file writes) is typical of an SDK. No explicit malicious network activity, such as data exfiltration or command execution, is directly visible. However, the code's structure, obfuscated naming, and handling of external data, especially in file upload/download, could be exploited if integrated into a malicious environment. The code also mishandles exceptions by raising strings, which is a Python anti-pattern, possibly indicating obfuscation or poor coding practices. Overall, no concrete evidence of malicious behavior is present, but the suspicious variable naming, incomplete URL building, and handling of files warrant caution.\",\n  \"conclusion\": \"This code appears to be a client SDK for an API with legitimate functionality related to project and asset management. While no explicit malicious behavior is evident, the code's structure, incomplete variable definitions, obfuscated names, and exception handling raise concerns. The presence of file handling and external network requests means it could potentially be exploited for malicious purposes if misused. Due to these factors, it warrants a security review, but no confirmed malicious intent or malware is identified from this code fragment alone.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.6,\n  \"obfuscated\": 0.4,\n  \"malware\": 0.2,\n  \"securityRisk\": 0.45\n}",
