  "conclusion": "The code is a sophisticated, possibly obfuscated SDK for project management APIs. It does not exhibit signs of active malware or malicious sabotage but contains structural irregularities, incomplete variables, and insecure practices that warrant cautious review before deployment. The malware score is low, obfuscation moderate, and overall security risk moderate."
