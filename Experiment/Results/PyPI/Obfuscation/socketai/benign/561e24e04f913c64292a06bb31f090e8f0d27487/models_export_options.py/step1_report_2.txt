{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes for managing date-based filters and export configurations, including serialization of filter criteria and export parameters.",
  "sources": "Data is read from class attributes such as from_date, to_date, and various configuration flags. The code also accesses imported enums and models.",
  "sinks": "The code serializes data into JSON strings and constructs dictionaries, which are returned for further use. No direct data leaks or system commands are executed.",
  "flows": "Input data from class attributes flows into JSON serialization and dictionary creation without external untrusted input influence or unsafe operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Usage of enums and date formatting appears standard. No obfuscated or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data encapsulation, formatting, and serialization for export settings and date filters. There are no indications of malicious behaviors such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. All operations are typical for configuration objects. The import statements and class methods suggest legitimate purposes. No unusual or suspicious code constructs, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate configuration and filtering utility without any malicious intent. It serializes data for use elsewhere, with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain risks.",
