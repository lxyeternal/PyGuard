{
  "purpose": "The code defines data structures and serialization methods for filtering and exporting data, likely related to reports or logs, with configurable options.",
  "sources": "Input data from class initializers, environment variables, or external modules (e.g., imported enums). No explicit input handling shown.",
  "sinks": "Data serialization via json.dumps, potential logging or network transmission if used externally, but no explicit sinks or network actions are present within this code.",
  "flows": "Input from class instantiation → processing in methods → JSON serialization, but no external flows or data leaks evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious strings, or unusual code patterns. Class and method names appear obfuscated but are consistent with typical obfuscation or auto-generated code. No dynamic code execution or suspicious side effects observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two classes: one for handling date range filtering and conversion to dictionary/JSON, and another for building a configuration dictionary for data export. Both classes perform data formatting and conditional inclusion of properties. No external data sources, network operations, or sensitive data handling detected. The code appears to be benign, mainly focused on data serialization and configuration setup. Names are obfuscated but do not indicate malicious intent. No suspicious logic, backdoors, or malicious patterns found.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard application logic for data configuration and serialization with no malicious behavior. It is likely part of a larger system responsible for data export or reporting. No signs of malware, backdoors, or security risks within this fragment.",
