{
  "purpose": "Defines multiple Enum classes with string constants, likely used for categorization or configuration within a larger application.",
  "sources": "Enum class definitions with string assignments; no external input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks such as data transmission, file writing, or environment variable usage.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; code is static declarations only.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious variable names, or obfuscated logic; code appears to be straightforward enum definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of enum class definitions with string values. There are no dynamic or external data sources, no data flows, no I/O operations, and no suspicious or malicious code constructs. Variable names appear obfuscated but are consistent with enumerated constants, likely auto-generated. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely static enum definitions serving as constants. There are no malicious behaviors, no suspicious data handling, and no security risks detected. It appears to be a benign configuration or categorization module.",
