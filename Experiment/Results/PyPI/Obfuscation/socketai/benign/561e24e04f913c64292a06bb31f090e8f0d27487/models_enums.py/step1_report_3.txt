{
  "purpose": "Define multiple Enum classes with seemingly descriptive constant names and string values, likely for configuration or categorization purposes.",
  "sources": "Static enum definitions, no external input reading or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks or data leaks; no untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code is solely static enum declarations.",
  "anomalies": "Enums are named with obfuscated-looking class names and variable names that do not clearly relate to their string values. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. No code execution or external data handling is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists exclusively of enum class definitions with nonsensical class and variable names. String values are straightforward labels, likely used as identifiers or constants. There are no functions, input/output operations, network calls, or suspicious constructs. The obfuscated class and variable names may be an attempt at hiding intent, but without further context, this appears as obfuscation rather than malicious activity. No malware signatures or malicious behaviors are evident. The code appears to be a set of static constant definitions, potentially auto-generated or deliberately obscured, but nothing indicates malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code only defines static enums with non-descriptive, obfuscated names and no active malicious or suspicious behavior. No indicators of malware or security risks are present. It is likely part of a larger codebase where these enums are used for configuration or categorization.",
