  "purpose": "Static enum definitions with obfuscated names and string constants; no external data, no I/O, no malicious code.",
  "sources": "Enum class definitions and string assignments within classes.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static constants only.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names, but no dynamic code or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static enum classes with string constants, obfuscated names, and no external interactions or dynamic behavior. No signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or suspicious activity are present. Obfuscation is high but does not imply malicious intent in this static context. The malware score is correctly set to 0, and the security risk score is low, reflecting the static and benign nature of the code. Obfuscation scores are high, consistent with naming patterns, but do not indicate malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static enum definitions with obfuscated names, and no malicious or security-threatening behavior. The scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
