  "purpose": "Define data models for managing project and organization roles, users, and project assignments.",
  "sources": "Input parameters in class constructors, such as strings for emails, project IDs, and role enums.",
  "sinks": "Methods that generate dictionaries potentially used for serialization or API responses; no evident direct data leakage.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into class attributes and then into return dictionaries via methods.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class and variable names; no hardcoded secrets or credentials; no external data fetching or network operations; no malicious code or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of data model classes with constructors initializing attributes and methods returning dictionaries. All input data appears to be from parameters, with role enums used for roles. No external data access, network operations, or suspicious behaviors are present. The obfuscation of class and variable names suggests code minimization or concealment, but does not indicate malicious intent. No code injection, backdoors, or malware signatures are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard data modeling code used for role and project management, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. The obfuscation does not imply malicious intent but could hinder clarity.",
