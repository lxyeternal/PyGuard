  "purpose": "A configuration class storing provider credentials and settings, including sensitive keys.",
  "sources": "Input data for class instantiation: name, provider, public_key, private_key, region, credentials.",
  "sinks": "The method yNzLHKVNDrWahNakVWNbPETWaRZdxojX returns all attributes, including sensitive data, which could be exposed if logged or transmitted insecurely.",
  "flows": "Input data assigned to attributes -> yNzLHKVNDrWahNakVWNbPETWaRZdxojX outputs attribute values, exposing sensitive data.",
  "anomalies": "The method returns sensitive keys and credentials directly; class and method names are obfuscated, which may hinder maintainability but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a credential container class with a method exposing sensitive data. Reports indicate 'Empty response' with no detailed findings, making it difficult to confirm vulnerabilities. The primary concern is the insecure exposure of secrets via the method, which could lead to credential leaks if misused. No malware or malicious behavior is evident; obfuscation is superficial. The risk score should be moderate due to potential mishandling, but malware score remains zero. The inconsistency in naming conventions and lack of validation are noted but not critical. Overall, the main issue is sensitive data exposure, not active malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code exposes sensitive keys through a method that returns all attributes, representing a security risk if mishandled. No evidence of malware or obfuscation is present. The reports lack detailed findings; thus, the overall security risk is moderate primarily due to potential credential leakage. Scores should reflect low malware and obfuscation but a higher risk score (~0.7) due to data exposure.",
