  "conclusion": "The code exposes sensitive keys through a method that returns all attributes, representing a security risk if mishandled. No evidence of malware or obfuscation is present. The reports lack detailed findings; thus, the overall security risk is moderate primarily due to potential credential leakage. Scores should reflect low malware and obfuscation but a higher risk score (~0.7) due to data exposure."
