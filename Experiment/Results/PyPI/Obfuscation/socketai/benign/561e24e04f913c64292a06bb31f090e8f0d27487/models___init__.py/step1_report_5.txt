  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated due to the absence of code content, making it difficult to determine its intent.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables, user input, or external files, but specific details are not provided as the code content is missing.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or subprocess calls, though no specific suspicious activity is observed due to lack of code details.",
  "flows": "Without actual code, no definitive source-to-sink data flows can be identified.",
  "anomalies": "The provided code snippet is empty, so there are no unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "There is no code present to analyze, thus no sources, sinks, or flows can be identified. The absence of code prevents detection of malicious patterns or anomalies. The lack of code also means no obfuscation or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided input, there is no code to analyze, and therefore no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The review cannot be completed without code content.",
