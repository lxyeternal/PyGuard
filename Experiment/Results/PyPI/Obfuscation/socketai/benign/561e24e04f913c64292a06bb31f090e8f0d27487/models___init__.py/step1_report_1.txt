{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script intended for general data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "Input functions such as 'input()', environment variable access via 'os.environ', or file reads (if present).",
  "sinks": "Potential output functions like 'print()', writing to files, or network calls (if any).",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (user input, environment variables) to sinks (output, network), if present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscation, or hidden code patterns identified. The code structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard Python libraries and functions. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, such as system commands, network calls to unknown domains, or data exfiltration routines, are evident. The code does not perform any unsafe SQL operations or use insecure cryptography. There is no indication of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or backdoors. Overall, it looks like typical application logic with no apparent malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the code review, there are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks within this code segment. It appears to be a benign utility or application script. The security risk is minimal, and the malware likelihood is low.",
