  "purpose": "To evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Code snippets, input handling, data processing functions, dynamic code execution points, environment variables, external data sources.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, dynamic code execution, data leaks, system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input sources to processing functions, then to potential sinks such as network or file system, possibly involving dynamic execution paths.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no hardcoded credentials, no malicious network activity detected, minimal security concerns.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate benign code with no malicious patterns or obfuscation. Scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0) are consistent with findings. Slightly higher security risk in Report 4 (0.3) due to potential input validation concerns is justified. Incomplete or absent code in Report 5 limits analysis but does not suggest malicious intent. Overall, the code appears safe, with minimal residual risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malware or obfuscation. Security risks are minimal, primarily due to cautious handling of dynamic code execution concerns. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
