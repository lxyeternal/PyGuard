  "purpose": "Load and utilize a profanity detection model and vectorizer for processing text input to predict profanity probability.",
  "sources": "Reading package resources or filenames for model and vectorizer based on Python version; transforming input data; loading models with joblib.",
  "sinks": "Transforming input data and calling predict_proba on the model; no direct data leakage or system modification observed.",
  "flows": "Input text -> transformation via vectorizer -> prediction via model -> probability extraction",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic resource loading based on Python version is standard; no suspicious hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code loads pre-trained models and vectorizers from package resources or files, depending on Python version, and performs predictions on input data. It employs typical data transformation and prediction workflows without any apparent data exfiltration, network activity, or system modifications. No hidden or malicious code segments are detected. The code appears to be a legitimate profanity detection component, with standard practices for resource handling and model usage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a profanity detection model loader and predictor with no evidence of malicious intent. It performs expected data transformations and predictions without any suspicious behavior or malicious code. Overall, it is a benign component used for content moderation.",
