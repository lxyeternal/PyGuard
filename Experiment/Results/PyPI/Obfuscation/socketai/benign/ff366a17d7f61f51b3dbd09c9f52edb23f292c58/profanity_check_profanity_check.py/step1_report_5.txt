{
  "purpose": "The code loads a machine learning model and a vectorizer, then provides functions to transform input data and compute probability scores, likely for detecting profanity.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from package resources or files related to the 'profanity_check' package, specifically 'vectorizer.joblib' and 'model.joblib'.",
  "sinks": "The functions process input data and generate probability scores; potential data leaks are not evident, but the code does load and transform data which could be misused if input is untrusted.",
  "flows": "Input data is received by the functions, transformed using the loaded vectorizer, and then passed to the model for prediction, resulting in probability scores.",
  "anomalies": "The variable names are intentionally obfuscated, but this alone is not malicious. The code dynamically loads models based on Python version, which is normal. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behaviors are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily loads pre-trained models and vectorizers from package resources or files, depending on Python version, then provides functions to process input data and extract probability scores. The obfuscation of variable names suggests an attempt to hide intent, but no malicious actions such as network communication, file modifications, or code injection are present. The code does not contain any suspicious loops, obfuscated logic, or external calls beyond loading resources. No indicators of malware or malicious behavior are detected, and the code's purpose appears to be for a profanity detection system.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical implementation for loading and using a machine learning model for profanity detection. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The obfuscation of variable names does not constitute malicious intent but slightly hampers readability. Overall, the code appears safe and aligned with its purpose.",
