  "purpose": "Load pre-trained profanity detection models and vectorizers, process input text, and predict profanity probabilities.",
  "sources": "Resource files for vectorizer and model; input text data for transformation and prediction.",
  "sinks": "Transforming input data and predicting probabilities; no untrusted data sinks or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Input text -> transformation via vectorizer -> model prediction -> output probability.",
  "anomalies": "Heavily obfuscated variable names; no malicious code, network activity, or data exfiltration detected.",
  "analysis": "The code loads models based on Python version, transforms input text, and predicts profanity probabilities. Variable names are obfuscated but do not indicate malicious intent. No suspicious network activity, data leaks, or code injection are present. The obfuscation appears superficial, serving to conceal variable names rather than malicious behavior. The model loading and prediction pipeline is standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of a profanity detection pipeline. No evidence of malicious activity, sabotage, or supply chain compromise is present. Obfuscation is superficial and does not imply malicious intent. The overall security risk is minimal, and the malware score should be 0. The obfuscation score can be set around 0.4 to reflect variable name concealment without malicious implication.",
