  "purpose": "Load and use a profanity detection model and vectorizer to transform input data and predict the probability of profanity.",
  "sources": "Reading Python version info from sys, loading model and vectorizer files from package resources or pkg_resources depending on Python version.",
  "sinks": "Transforming input data and computing prediction probabilities; no direct sinks that leak data or execute untrusted commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input (KnIYczToUiQRGdFzBOCBIpUHwxEgkZCb) -> transformed by vectorizer -> prediction probabilities -> extraction of second element (probability).",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic resource loading based on Python version; no evident hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscation. Variable names are obfuscated but do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code loads a pre-trained model and vectorizer from package data, depending on Python version. It defines functions to transform input data and obtain the probability of profanity. No external network communication, no data exfiltration, and no code injection observed. Variable names are obfuscated but do not suggest malicious intent. The model loading uses standard resource handling methods, and the functions are straightforward in transforming data and retrieving probabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to perform a profanity detection task using pre-trained models loaded securely from package resources. No malicious behavior or supply chain attacks are evident. Obfuscated variable names seem to be for code brevity or obfuscation but do not imply malicious activity.",
