  "purpose": "Load a machine learning model and vectorizer for profanity detection, and provide functions to process input data and obtain probabilities.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info for Python version; reading model and vectorizer files from package resources or package data; input parameter 'KnIYczToUiQRGdFzBOCBIpUHwxEgkZCb' for processing.",
  "sinks": "transform() method of the vectorizer; predict_proba() method of the loaded model; returning probability scores.",
  "flows": "Input data -> transform() -> predict_proba() -> process probabilities with bMCuFQUkKRgNdOnnqfSIBAHCLXHtTkes -> output.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names; loading resources based on Python version; no explicit handling of untrusted input validation or sanitization; no evident malicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code loads pre-trained machine learning components (vectorizer and model) from package data, conditioned on Python version, and provides functions to process input text data for profanity prediction. The use of obfuscated variable names appears to be an attempt at code concealment but does not necessarily indicate malicious intent. No network activity, system modification, or data exfiltration code is present. The code solely processes input data through ML models for classification purposes. There are no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a profanity detection pipeline using pre-trained models, with obfuscated variable names that could be a form of code concealment but do not indicate malicious intent. No malicious activities or security risks are evident from this fragment.",
