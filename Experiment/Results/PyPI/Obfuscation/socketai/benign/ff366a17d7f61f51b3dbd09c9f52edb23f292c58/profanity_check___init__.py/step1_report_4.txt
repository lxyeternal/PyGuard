{
  "purpose": "Import functions from a local module named 'profanity_check' and define a version string",
  "sources": "Import statement from the current package's 'profanity_check' module",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no data output or network communication",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; only imports and a string assignment",
  "anomalies": "Imported function names are obfuscated and appear as random strings, which is unusual and suspicious. The version string is straightforward but may be used for version checks or compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two functions with obfuscated names from a local module, which is uncommon and could be an attempt to hide malicious intent or functionality. The functions are not called, and there are no other operations. The version string is a standard assignment. The presence of obfuscated function names warrants suspicion, especially if the module 'profanity_check' is known or untrusted. No data flows or external communications are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself appears minimal but the obfuscated function names suggest potential obfuscation or malicious intent. Without additional context, the code could be benign, but the unusual naming warrants caution. No clear malicious behavior is detected, but the obfuscation is suspicious.",
