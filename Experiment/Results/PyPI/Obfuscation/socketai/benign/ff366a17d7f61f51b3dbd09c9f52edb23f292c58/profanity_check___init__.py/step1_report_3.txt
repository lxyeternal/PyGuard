{
  "purpose": "Import specific functions from a module named 'profanity_check' and assign a version string to a variable.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing functions 'pRgvbBXjUHHLfXrItOdAcddvsuZDDaWt' and 'SvAwdxXLceboLtCOgSrIoQxkmhvOEFXc' from the local module '.profanity_check'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks involving untrusted data or external communication are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only performs static imports and a variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "The imported function names appear obfuscated and nonsensical, indicating potential obfuscation or malicious intent. The version string is a standard string assignment with no apparent issues.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two functions with highly obfuscated names from a local module, which could suggest an attempt to hide functionality or malicious behavior. No actual use of these functions or external communication is shown, but the obfuscated names and the fact that only import statements are present are suspicious. The version string assignment is benign. Without further context, the obfuscated import names are the main concern, possibly indicating malicious intent or an attempt to hide malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal but contains suspicious obfuscated function names that could indicate malicious intent or obfuscation tactics. No malicious actions are explicitly visible, but the obfuscation warrants caution.",
