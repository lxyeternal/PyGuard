  "purpose": "Import obfuscated functions from a local module for profanity checking and define a version string.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a relative module '.profanity_check'. The string assignment is a hardcoded version identifier.",
  "sinks": "Potential sink could be the imported functions if they process untrusted data, but the code itself does not show data processing.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow; only import and variable assignment are present.",
  "anomalies": "The function names are highly obfuscated, likely generated or intentionally obscured, which could be suspicious. The version string is straightforward. No other unusual code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two functions with obscure, non-descriptive names from a local module, which might be an attempt to hide malicious behavior or evade detection. The version string is a simple assignment. There are no indications of malicious actions such as network activity, data exfiltration, or system modification within this snippet. The obfuscated function names could be a concern if these functions are malicious, but their implementation is not shown. Overall, the code appears minimal and benign but with obfuscation that warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal, with obfuscated import names suggesting possible concealment. There are no direct malicious actions observable here, but the obfuscation could be used to hide malicious behavior in the imported functions. No evidence of malware or security risk is confirmed within this fragment alone.",
