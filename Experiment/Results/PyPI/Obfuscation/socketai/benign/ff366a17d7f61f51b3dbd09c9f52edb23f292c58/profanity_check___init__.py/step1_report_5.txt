  "purpose": "Import specific functions from a module named 'profanity_check' and define a version string.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing functions from a relative module, and a string assignment.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks are present in this code fragment.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only imports and assigns a version string.",
  "anomalies": "The function names 'pRgvbBXjUHHLfXrItOdAcddvsuZDDaWt' and 'SvAwdxXLceboLtCOgSrIoQxkmhvOEFXc' appear obfuscated or nonsensical, which is unusual and could indicate malicious obfuscation or concealment.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two functions with seemingly random or obfuscated names from a relative module 'profanity_check'. It also assigns a version string '1.0.6' to a variable. The function names are suspicious due to their randomness, which may suggest obfuscation intended to hide malicious purposes. However, the code itself is minimal and does not contain any malicious actions or data leaks. No suspicious network activity or credential handling is present in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal and appears to import functions with obfuscated names, which could be a tactic to conceal malicious intent. However, based solely on this fragment, there is no concrete evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscated function names warrant further review of the imported module for full assessment.",
