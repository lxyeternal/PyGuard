  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'alt-profanity-check', including metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' via Path.read_text(), defines package metadata, dependencies, package data, classifiers, and entry points.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, network activity, or external data processing detected.",
  "flows": "Initialization of package setup parameters without dynamic or untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names (e.g., SbUfTGEHSCLMsQiPzdDipykHkgVZcwuR, MiwnNtTWjRcPYZtGofERXxBxNJsVVRzi, hgGUeeeWFqyepzDegfeNJhTNyEDvJpeX) which are unusual for standard setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical package setup tasks, including reading a README file and defining metadata, dependencies, and entry points. The use of obfuscated variable names is suspicious but not indicative of malicious behavior. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input is present. All reports agree on the benign nature of the script, with the primary concern being obfuscation. Malware scores are consistently zero, indicating no malicious intent. Obfuscation scores are high due to variable naming, but this does not impact security. Overall, the script is low risk, with obfuscation being the main anomaly.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with obfuscated variable names that are suspicious but not malicious. There is no evidence of supply chain attack, malware, or malicious intent. The obfuscation appears stylistic or accidental rather than malicious. The overall security risk is minimal, and the package can be considered safe.",
