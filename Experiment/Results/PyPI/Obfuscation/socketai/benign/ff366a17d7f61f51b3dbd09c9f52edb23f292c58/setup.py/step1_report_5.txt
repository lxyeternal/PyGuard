  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package 'alt-profanity-check' that includes package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads content from 'README.md' file and retrieves package data files. No input from untrusted sources observed.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks involving untrusted data processing or external communications.",
  "flows": "Reads 'README.md' content; loads package data files; registers package setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated-like variable names (e.g., SbUfTGEHSCLMsQiPzdDipykHkgVZcwuR, MiwnNtTWjRcPYZtGofERXxBxNJsVVRzi, hgGUeeeWFqyepzDegfeNJhTNyEDvJpeX) without clear purpose; no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs package setup using setuptools. It reads a README file, specifies package metadata, dependencies, package data, classifiers, and console entry points. The variable names appear intentionally obscure but do not perform any malicious actions. No input validation, no external untrusted data processing, and no code injection or network activities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup configuration for a Python package with intentionally obfuscated variable names. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The package setup process does not involve any suspicious activity.",
