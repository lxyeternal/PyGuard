  "purpose": "The code performs profanity detection on input strings, providing binary and probabilistic predictions for each input.",
  "sources": "Reads input strings from command-line arguments (sys.argv[1:]).",
  "sinks": "Prints output to standard output and error; no evidence of data leaks or external communications.",
  "flows": "Input strings (source) are processed by functions imported from a local module, then results are printed (sink).",
  "anomalies": "The code imports obfuscated-looking functions with non-descriptive names; no hardcoded credentials or secrets are evident. No dynamic code execution or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script accepts command-line arguments as input, then calls two functions from a local module (profanity_check) to analyze each string. The functions' internal implementations are not provided, but the usage appears straightforward. The code simply outputs predictions without any network communication or data exfiltration. The naming of imported functions is intentionally obscure, but that alone does not indicate malicious intent. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The code is procedural, with no complex control flows or obfuscation techniques beyond non-descriptive identifiers.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs input validation, processes strings through imported functions, and outputs predictions without any suspicious or malicious activities. There is no evidence of malware or security risks based on this snippet.",
