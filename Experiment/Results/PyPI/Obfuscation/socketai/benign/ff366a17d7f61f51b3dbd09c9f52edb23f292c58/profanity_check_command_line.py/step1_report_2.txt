  "purpose": "The script performs profanity detection on input strings, providing binary and probabilistic predictions for each input.",
  "sources": "Reads input strings from command line arguments via sys.argv",
  "sinks": "Prints predictions to stdout; no evident data leaks or external connections",
  "flows": "Input strings -> predictions functions -> print outputs",
  "anomalies": "Use of obscure variable names and imported functions with seemingly random identifiers; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code evident",
  "analysis": "The code takes command line arguments as input, then processes each string through two functions imported from a local module, likely performing profanity checks. It outputs predictions in a formatted manner. No external network activity, file access, or data exfiltration is present. The variable naming is unusual but not malicious. No code injection, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior detected. The imported functions are external but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious operations are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward profanity detection utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. Its unusual variable naming may suggest obfuscation, but no malicious behavior or malware is evident.",
