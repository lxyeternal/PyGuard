  "purpose": "Command-line profanity detection utility that processes input strings using external obfuscated functions and outputs predictions.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments (`sys.argv[1:]`), external imported functions for predictions.",
  "sinks": "Output to stdout, no evidence of data leaks or external communications.",
  "flows": "Input strings -> external prediction functions -> output predictions to console.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function and variable names, inconsistent variable usage in print statements (e.g., undefined `item_and_prediction`), potential concealment of malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code reads input strings, applies two external functions for binary and probabilistic predictions, and prints results. The obfuscated names suggest possible concealment but no malicious activity is evident. The code contains a bug where the variable `item_and_prediction` is used but not defined; it should reference the loop variable. The imported functions' implementation is unknown, which warrants caution. The scores from reports are consistent: malware score 0, high obfuscation (~0.8), low security risk (~0.2). Given the lack of evidence for malicious behavior, the overall risk remains low, but the obfuscation warrants further review of the imported functions.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign profanity checker with obfuscated internal functions. No malicious activity is observable in the provided code snippet. The high obfuscation suggests caution, but without evidence of malicious intent, the code is considered low risk. The scoring aligns with this assessment, though further inspection of the imported functions is recommended to confirm their benign nature.",
