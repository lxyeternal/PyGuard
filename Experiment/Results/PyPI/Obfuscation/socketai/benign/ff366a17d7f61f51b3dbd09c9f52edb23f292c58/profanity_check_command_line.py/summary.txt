  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign profanity checker with obfuscated internal functions. No malicious activity is observable in the provided code snippet. The high obfuscation suggests caution, but without evidence of malicious intent, the code is considered low risk. The scoring aligns with this assessment, though further inspection of the imported functions is recommended to confirm their benign nature."
