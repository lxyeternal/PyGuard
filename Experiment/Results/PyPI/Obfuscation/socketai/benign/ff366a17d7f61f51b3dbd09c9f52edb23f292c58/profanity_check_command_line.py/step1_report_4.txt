  "purpose": "The code appears to perform profanity checking on input strings provided via command line arguments, producing binary and probabilistic predictions.",
  "sources": "Reads input strings from command line arguments (sys.argv[1:])",
  "sinks": "Outputs predictions to standard output (print statements)",
  "flows": "Input strings -> profanity check functions -> output predictions to stdout",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated function names; no hardcoded credentials; no suspicious external connections; no malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two functions from a local module, likely performing profanity checks. It processes command line arguments, checks for at least one argument, and then performs binary and probabilistic predictions on each input string, printing results. The variable and function names are intentionally obfuscated, but there are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The functions imported are not shown but are assumed to be standard profanity checkers based on context. No insecure practices or suspicious logic are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a profanity filter utility. It does not contain malicious code or security risks based on the visible logic. The obfuscation appears to be an attempt to hide implementation details but does not suggest malicious intent.",
