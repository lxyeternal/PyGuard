      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with obfuscated variable names that are suspicious but not malicious. There is no evidence of supply chain attack, malware, or malicious intent. The obfuscation appears stylistic or accidental rather than malicious. The overall security risk is minimal, and the package can be considered safe."

      "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign profanity checker with obfuscated internal functions. No malicious activity is observable in the provided code snippet. The high obfuscation suggests caution, but without evidence of malicious intent, the code is considered low risk. The scoring aligns with this assessment, though further inspection of the imported functions is recommended to confirm their benign nature."

      "conclusion": "The code appears benign but suspicious due to highly obfuscated function names. No evidence of malicious activity is present in this fragment. The scores are appropriate, but further review of the 'profanity_check' module is recommended to confirm whether the imported functions contain malicious code."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of a profanity detection pipeline. No evidence of malicious activity, sabotage, or supply chain compromise is present. Obfuscation is superficial and does not imply malicious intent. The overall security risk is minimal, and the malware score should be 0. The obfuscation score can be set around 0.4 to reflect variable name concealment without malicious implication."
