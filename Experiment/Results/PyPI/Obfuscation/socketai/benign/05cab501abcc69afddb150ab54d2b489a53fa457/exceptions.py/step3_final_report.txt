  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes with obfuscated names inheriting from trytond.exceptions, likely for concealment or obfuscation purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statements from trytond.exceptions; class definitions with obfuscated names",
  "sinks": "No data input/output, network activity, or external interactions present",
  "flows": "Class inheritance from exception classes; no data flow or execution flow beyond class definitions",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class names that do not convey meaningful intent; no functional code or logic",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from known exception classes with nonsensical names. There is no runtime logic, data handling, or external interactions. The obfuscation of class names is suspicious but not inherently malicious. The absence of malicious payloads, network activity, or data exfiltration indicates a benign intent. The obfuscation may be an attempt to conceal purpose or simply code obfuscation. The malware score is appropriately zero; security risk is minimal but slightly elevated due to obfuscation. Confidence in benign assessment is high, but the obfuscation warrants cautious monitoring.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with obfuscated class names possibly serving to conceal or obfuscate intent. No evidence of malicious behavior or active security threats is present. The assigned scores are consistent with this assessment; malware is unlikely, and security risk remains low. Continuous monitoring is recommended if additional context or code is available.",
