  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error and warning handling, inheriting from trytond.exceptions.",
  "sources": "Import statement from trytond.exceptions module.",
  "sinks": "Exception class definitions; no untrusted data handling or output occurs.",
  "flows": "Import leads to class inheritance; no data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "Class names are obfuscated and contain random character sequences; class inheritance is straightforward, but naming is suspiciously opaque.",
  "analysis": "The code imports exception classes from an external library and defines new exception classes with obfuscated names that inherit from these exceptions. The class names appear to be intentionally nonsensical or randomized, which is uncommon in standard, clean code. No input handling, data processing, or malicious activity such as network calls or data exfiltration is present. The obfuscation could be a sign of attempting concealment but might also be an unusual naming style; there are no indicators of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code simply defines obfuscated class names inheriting from known exceptions, with no malicious behavior or security risks evident. The obfuscated naming is suspicious but does not constitute malicious activity in itself.",
