  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes inheriting from trytond.exceptions for use in an application.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; class definitions are static.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external communication points present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; classes are only defining exceptions without logic or data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Class names are obfuscated or nonsensical, which is unusual and may suggest concealment or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard exception classes and defines several new exception classes with seemingly random or obfuscated names. There is no logic, data handling, or external interactions present. The class names do not correspond to typical naming conventions, which may indicate an attempt to hide intent or just obfuscate. No malicious code, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior is evident. The code appears to be harmless in isolation, but the obfuscated class names warrant caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists of harmless class definitions for exceptions with obfuscated names. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident, though the obfuscated naming pattern is unusual and could be indicative of concealment or obfuscation tactics.",
