  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes inheriting from trytond.exceptions for use within a larger application or package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from trytond.exceptions module.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data or untrusted input handling or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the classes are simply defined as subclasses.",
  "anomalies": "Class names appear obfuscated or intentionally obscure, which could be suspicious; no other unusual code behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports exception classes from a known library and defines new subclasses with seemingly random or obfuscated class names. There are no functions, data handling, or logic. The class definitions do not include any malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious behavior. The obfuscated class names may suggest attempts at hiding intent but could also be an artifact of obfuscation or code generation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign set of class definitions for custom exceptions, with obfuscated class names. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risks within this code snippet.",
