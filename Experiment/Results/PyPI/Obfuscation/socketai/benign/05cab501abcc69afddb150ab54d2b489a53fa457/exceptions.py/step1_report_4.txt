  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes that inherit from trytond.exceptions, likely for use in a larger application.",
  "sources": "Import statement from trytond.exceptions; class definitions that inherit from imported exceptions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; classes are just definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Class names are obfuscated or nonsensical, with seemingly random string patterns; no additional functionality or code logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports exception classes and defines new subclasses with obfuscated class names. These classes do not contain methods or attributes, serving solely as custom exceptions. The naming pattern suggests an attempt at obscuration but is limited to class naming. There are no functions, no data input handling, no suspicious network or file operations, and no evident malicious code. The structure is minimal and straightforward, indicating a benign purpose related to exception handling. The obfuscated class names could be for hiding the intent or simply as code obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to serve as a set of custom exception definitions with obfuscated class names. There is no malicious behavior or malware present, and no security risks are evident from this snippet.",
