  "conclusion": "The script is primarily configuration and setup code with high obfuscation but no active malicious activity. The main risks stem from subprocess execution and environment variable manipulation, which could be exploited if inputs are malicious. The malware score is low, and the security risk is moderate. Obfuscation is notable but not necessarily malicious. Overall, the code is benign but should be reviewed in context, especially regarding subprocess calls and input validation."
