  "conclusion": "The code is complex and obfuscated, with dynamic SQL and schema modifications that could be exploited maliciously. However, no direct evidence of malware or active malicious payloads is detected. The suspicion level warrants caution, and further dynamic analysis or runtime review is recommended before deployment."
