  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its behavior, obfuscation, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The code extends account models, adds a 'statement' selection, and validates move lines linked to 'account.statement' before posting. It raises a `PostError` if a move linked to a statement isn't in 'posted' state.\n- **Obfuscation:** Class and method names are nonsensical and obfuscated, which could be an attempt to conceal functionality.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected; no network, file, or system command activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard validation logic with obfuscation. No malware or security risk evident.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0.7 — seems reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on extending models with obfuscated names, adding a 'statement' type, and validation to prevent posting unposted statement moves.\n- **Obfuscation:** Heavy, with nonsensical class/method names.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected; no external interactions.\n- **Conclusion:** Likely a legitimate but obfuscated customization. No malware.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0.8 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Extends account models, adds a validation button, checks move states, and raises exceptions if conditions aren't met.\n- **Obfuscation:** Names are highly obfuscated.\n- **Malicious activity:** None; no network or system commands.\n- **Conclusion:** Obfuscated but standard extension code, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0.7 — consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Adds selection options and validation for posting statements, with obfuscated class/method names.\n- **Obfuscation:** Present, but no malicious indicators.\n- **Malicious activity:** None.\n- **Conclusion:** Typical extension with obfuscation; no malware.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0.7 — reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar pattern: extending models, adding validation, obfuscated identifiers, no external calls.\n- **Obfuscation:** Heavy.\n- **Malicious activity:** None.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard validation logic, obfuscated names, no malware.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0.8 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports describe code that extends Tryton models, adds validation, and manipulates selection options.\n- **Obfuscation:** Consistently high across all reports, which is suspicious but not inherently malicious.\n- **Malware:** No evidence of malicious activity, network calls, data exfiltration, or system commands.\n- **Security risk:** Very low; mainly obfuscation and standard validation logic.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The obfuscation is the primary concern, as it hampers readability and security review. This warrants further investigation to confirm the intent.\n- The malware score should remain at **0** given the absence of malicious indicators.\n- The obfuscation score can be increased slightly, but not to the maximum, since obfuscation alone isn't malicious.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Security Risk |\n|---------|--------------|----------------|\n| **0**   | **0.75**     | **0.2**        |\n\nThe obfuscation score is around 0.75 due to consistent nonsensical naming, but the malware score remains at 0, as no malicious activity is detected.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code appears to be heavily obfuscated extensions of Tryton accounting models, performing standard validation and customization tasks. No evidence of malware or malicious intent is present. The primary concern is the obfuscation, which should be clarified or deobfuscated for a thorough security review.",
