  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script intended to perform a specific task, but the exact purpose cannot be determined due to lack of context and incomplete information.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from environment variables and user inputs; loads external data files; fetches data over network connections.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to console; writes data to files; sends data over network connections; executes system commands.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input sources (environment variables, user input, network data) flow into data processing functions and then into output or system execution points.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials or secrets; no use of obfuscated code; no suspicious network domains or IPs; no malicious system commands detected. The code structure appears straightforward, but incomplete code snippets prevent full analysis.",
  "analysis": "The code involves reading data from environment variables and user inputs, which are common sources of untrusted data. It writes or outputs data to files or console and makes network requests, potentially exposing data leaks if sensitive data is transmitted unencrypted. No malicious code patterns such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or cryptomining are evident. The code does not contain obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious logic based on the provided snippets. However, the absence of complete context limits full certainty.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippets, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. The code appears benign, with no hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or malicious logic. Confidence in this conclusion is moderate due to incomplete information.",
