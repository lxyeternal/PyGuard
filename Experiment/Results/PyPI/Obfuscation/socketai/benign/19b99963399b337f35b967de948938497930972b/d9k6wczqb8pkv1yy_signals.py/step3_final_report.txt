  "sinks": "Database queries (filter, order_by, first), external utility call.",
  "flows": "Pre_save reads existing records to assign sequence; post_migrate calls external setup function.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of variable and class names, no hardcoded secrets or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard Django model handling with obfuscated identifiers. No malicious actions are evident. Obfuscation may be for proprietary concealment but does not imply malicious intent. No secrets, network activity, or system modifications are present. The logic is straightforward, and external utility usage appears routine.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Django setup routine with obfuscation. No malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities are detected. The high obfuscation score reflects naming concealment but does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code is benign with a low security risk.",
