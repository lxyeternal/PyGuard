  "purpose": "This code is intended to set up and install a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; imports from setuptools but does not read external data or input.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code simply calls the setup() function with no arguments.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; calling setup() with default parameters is standard practice. No suspicious or unusual code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'setuptools' library and immediately calls setup() with default arguments. This is a typical minimal setup script for Python packaging. There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors. The code performs a basic package setup with no additional logic or data handling, indicating standard behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs minimal, expected packaging operations.",
