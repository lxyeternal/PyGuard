{
  "purpose": "To set up and install the Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The 'setup()' function call, which may process setup configuration data.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function itself, which could potentially handle untrusted input if configuration data is externally supplied.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only invokes setup() with default parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. The setup() function is used with default arguments, indicating no malicious modifications or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'setuptools' library and calls setup() with no arguments. This is a standard setup script used to package Python projects. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data leaks, or malicious configuration. The code is minimal and conventional for Python packaging.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical minimal setup script for packaging Python modules. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
