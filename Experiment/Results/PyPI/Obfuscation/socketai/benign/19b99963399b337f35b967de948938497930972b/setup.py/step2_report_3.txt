  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms that the code is a standard setup script with no malicious activity.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- This aligns with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior.\n- No issues here.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Also describes the code as a minimal, typical setup script.\n- Slightly assigns a securityRisk score of 0.1, citing the potential for configuration data to be processed.\n- However, the code only calls `setup()` with default parameters; no external input or configuration is provided.\n- The reasoning that calling `setup()` with no arguments could be risky is weak, as it doesn't process untrusted data.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 seem slightly high given the code's nature.\n- I would suggest lowering the securityRisk to 0, consistent with the other reports.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Similar to previous, confirming the benign nature.\n- Scores are all zero, which is appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Also confirms the code as a minimal, standard setup script.\n- Same reasoning applies; no malicious activity.\n- Scores are all zero, which is consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Notes the code's minimalism and that passing no arguments is unusual but not malicious.\n- Assigns a securityRisk of 0.1.\n- Given the code's simplicity and lack of data handling, this risk score seems overstated.\n- I would recommend lowering it to 0.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Adjustments:\n- All reports agree the code is benign.\n- The malware score should remain at 0.\n- The obfuscated score should be 0.\n- The securityRisk score should be 0 for all reports, as there's no evidence of vulnerability or malicious intent.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence: a minimal, standard setup script with no signs of malicious or risky behavior.",
