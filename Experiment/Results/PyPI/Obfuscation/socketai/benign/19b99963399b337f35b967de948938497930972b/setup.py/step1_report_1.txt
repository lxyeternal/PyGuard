  "purpose": "This code is used to set up and install a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'setup' function from the 'setuptools' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or source-to-sink paths in this minimal setup code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is extremely minimal, with no configuration parameters, no hardcoded secrets, and no dynamic behavior. No anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setup' from 'setuptools' and calls 'setup()' with default parameters. This is a common pattern in Python package setup scripts. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or suspicious behavior. It does not perform any network activity, data manipulation, or system modifications. The simplicity of the code indicates it is likely a legitimate setup script.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
