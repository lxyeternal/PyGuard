The dynamic import of signals is a common pattern but, combined with obfuscation, could be used to conceal malicious code. However, there is no evidence of malicious activity or security risks based solely on this snippet."

There is no direct evidence of malicious behavior such as network communication, data theft, or sabotage. The primary concern is the obfuscation, which could be used to hide malicious functionalities. Scores reflect low malware likelihood but high obfuscation suspicion."

Given the absence of suspicious patterns and the benign nature of the code, the dependency can be considered safe under the evaluated scope."

The obfuscation may be for concealment but does not constitute malicious intent. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscation is high (~0.75), and security risk is low (~0.2). The overall assessment indicates a benign configuration with suspicious obfuscation but no malicious activity."

The scores assigned—malware at 0, obfuscation at 0.8, and risk at 0.3—are consistent with the analysis. Further investigation into the origin of the obfuscated code is advised to ensure legitimacy."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django migration with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not justify classifying the code as malicious. The scores are consistent with the analysis, with a malware score of 0, high obfuscation, and low security risk."

The obfuscation raises suspicion but is not conclusive of malicious intent. The overall security risk is moderate due to obfuscation, but the code appears structurally sound and benign."
