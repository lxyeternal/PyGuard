  "purpose": "Define a Django migration for altering a field in a model to use a ForeignKey relationship.",
  "sources": "Imports from django.db.models.deletion and django.db.migrations; class definition; lists specifying migration dependencies; AlterField call altering 'order' model's 'coupon_code' field.",
  "sinks": "The ForeignKey field 'xxHDXyUsRabUHfNaGaxTKhAgVekpfSUP' that connects to 'artd_promotion.coupon'.",
  "flows": "Migration dependencies lead to the AlterField operation which modifies 'coupon_code' to be a ForeignKey to 'artd_promotion.coupon', establishing data relationships.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable naming (e.g., 'waOsiyamuNNwmOCnPdsAxbZtCGhATjfs'), random-looking attribute names (e.g., 'qElOWtwugdDQnvvEbAlAvXNEBwwMgxYJ'), and inconsistent boolean assignments (e.g., 'pLNZPyPIhVACZPbQKQdGQORJBADLAsnU=True'). These may suggest obfuscation or generated code, but not necessarily malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django migration class with obfuscated and nonsensical attribute names, which could be a sign of obfuscation or automated code generation. The main operation is an AlterField that sets the 'coupon_code' field of the 'order' model as a ForeignKey to 'artd_promotion.coupon', which is typical for relational data. No suspicious network activity, data leakage, or malicious payloads are present. The unusual variable names and inconsistent attribute assignments are suspicious but do not indicate malware or malicious behavior by themselves; they might be an attempt to hide or confuse. No external data sources, user input, or system calls are evident. The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose—defining a migration—albeit with obfuscated style.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily performs a standard Django migration with obfuscated variable and attribute names. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks beyond obfuscation. The unusual naming is suspicious but not inherently harmful.",
