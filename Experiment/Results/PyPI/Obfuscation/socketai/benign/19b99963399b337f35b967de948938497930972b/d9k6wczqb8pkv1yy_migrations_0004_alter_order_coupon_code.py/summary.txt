  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated Django migration altering a ForeignKey relationship. No direct malicious activity is evident, but the obfuscation warrants caution. The scores assigned—malware at 0, obfuscation at 0.8, and risk at 0.3—are consistent with the analysis. Further investigation into the origin of the obfuscated code is advised to ensure legitimacy."
