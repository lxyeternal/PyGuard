{
  "purpose": "This code is a Django migration script intended to alter the 'coupon_code' field of the 'order' model to be a ForeignKey referencing 'artd_promotion.coupon'.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the migration class attributes defining dependencies and the AlterField operation, as well as the model and field names involved.",
  "sinks": "Potential untrusted data flows are not explicitly present; the code modifies schema definitions without handling external input or network activity.",
  "flows": "The migration alters the 'coupon_code' field to point to a foreign key, affecting data integrity but not involving untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of class names, variable names, and attribute identifiers; inconsistent syntax and nonsensical attribute assignments suggest obfuscation or corruption.",
  "analysis": "The code is a Django migration with heavily obfuscated identifiers, making comprehension difficult. The core operation is a standard schema change, but the obfuscation raises suspicion. No evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or embedded backdoors is present. The irregular syntax and nonsensical attribute assignments could indicate auto-generated or intentionally concealed code. The obfuscation level is high, justified by the nonsensical names, but the functional intent appears legitimate. Scores reflect this: malware likelihood is low, obfuscation is high, and security risk is moderate due to potential concealment. Further source verification is recommended.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated Django migration altering a ForeignKey relationship. No direct malicious activity is evident, but the obfuscation warrants caution. The scores assigned—malware at 0, obfuscation at 0.8, and risk at 0.3—are consistent with the analysis. Further investigation into the origin of the obfuscated code is advised to ensure legitimacy.",
