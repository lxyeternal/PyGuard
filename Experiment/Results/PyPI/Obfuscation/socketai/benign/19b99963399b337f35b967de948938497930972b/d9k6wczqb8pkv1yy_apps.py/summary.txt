  "conclusion": "The code appears to be an obfuscated but benign Django application configuration snippet. The dynamic import of signals is a common pattern but, combined with obfuscation, could be used to conceal malicious code. However, there is no evidence of malicious activity or security risks based solely on this snippet."
