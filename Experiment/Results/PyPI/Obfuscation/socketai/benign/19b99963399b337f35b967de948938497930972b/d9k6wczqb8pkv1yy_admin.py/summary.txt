  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated Django admin configuration with no evidence of malicious behavior or active vulnerabilities. The obfuscation may be for concealment but does not constitute malicious intent. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscation is high (~0.75), and security risk is low (~0.2). The overall assessment indicates a benign configuration with suspicious obfuscation but no malicious activity."
