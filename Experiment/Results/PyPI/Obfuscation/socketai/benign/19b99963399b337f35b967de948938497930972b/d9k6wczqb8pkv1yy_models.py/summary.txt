  "conclusion": "The code is a Django-based order management module with heavy obfuscation. There is no direct evidence of malicious behavior such as network communication, data theft, or sabotage. The primary concern is the obfuscation, which could be used to hide malicious functionalities. Scores reflect low malware likelihood but high obfuscation suspicion."
