  "purpose": "The code appears to initialize and use third-party libraries, possibly for data processing or network communication, but the exact purpose cannot be determined from the provided snippet.",
  "sources": "Data is read from environment variables, user input, or external files (not explicitly shown). Potential sources include environment variables or imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Data could be sent over network connections, written to files, or used in system commands. Specific sinks are not explicitly shown but implied by typical module behavior.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input or data from sources could flow into network communication functions, file I/O, or system commands, but explicit flow paths are not visible.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious function calls are detected. The code structure appears standard; however, the lack of context makes it difficult to rule out hidden malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The snippet includes standard imports and possibly function definitions, but without more code, it’s challenging to trace data flow or identify malicious patterns. No suspicious functions or behaviors like network exfiltration, backdoors, or data theft are visible. The code appears benign based on the visible portions but lacks context to conclusively rule out malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code fragment, there are no clear signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to perform routine tasks, with no evident anomalies or malicious actions. However, due to limited visibility, a low-confidence assessment is appropriate.",
  "confidence": 0.4,
