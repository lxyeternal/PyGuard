{
  "purpose": "To evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks, focusing on code signals such as suspicious patterns, obfuscation, and malicious actions.",
  "sources": "Input data reading points, environment variables, network connections, file operations, user inputs, and dynamic code execution points.",
  "sinks": "Data leaks, network transmissions, system modifications, command executions, or any untrusted data flows leading to potential harm.",
  "flows": "Sources feeding into sinks directly or via intermediate processing, especially involving untrusted data or dynamic code evaluation.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded secrets, obscure variable names, unnecessary dynamic code execution, obfuscation, suspicious imports, or unusual control flow.",
  "analysis": "The code lacks explicit content; assessments rely on descriptions. For reports with no code, the conclusion of no malicious activity and low risk is justified. For ambiguous code, suspicion is noted but no concrete malicious indicators are present. Scores are consistent with the evidence or lack thereof. Slightly increased risk scores could be justified in ambiguous cases, but current low scores are appropriate given the absence of direct malicious signals.",
  "conclusion": "All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious code or provide justified caution based on ambiguity. Malware scores remain at 0, obfuscation scores at 0, and security risks are low, reflecting limited evidence of threats. The assessments are consistent and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
