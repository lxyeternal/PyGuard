  "purpose": "Evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Code snippets, environment variables, network communication, dynamic execution points, cryptographic operations, obfuscation indicators.",
  "sinks": "Network calls, environment variable access, file operations, dynamic eval/exec, cryptographic functions, data leaks.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or network inputs to sinks like eval/exec or data exfiltration points.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation scores, dynamic code execution, network activity, hardcoded secrets, unusual imports or function calls, inconsistent confidence levels.",
  "analysis": "All reports without code (2, 3, 5) correctly assign zero scores and note the lack of data. Report 1 reasonably assigns zero malware and obfuscation scores with a low security risk, aligning with its benign description. Report 4 describes suspicious patterns like dynamic eval, network activity, and obfuscation, justifying a malware score of approximately 0.45, obfuscated score around 0.75, and security risk near 0.6, reflecting moderate suspicion. These scores are consistent with the described behaviors, though they could be slightly adjusted if actual code confirms or refutes the suspicion. Overall, the assessments are cautious and aligned with the evidence presented.",
  "conclusion": "The reports' scoring and reasoning are appropriate given the available information. For suspicious patterns described in Report 4, a slightly higher malware score (around 0.45) and obfuscation (around 0.75) are justified. The absence of code in other reports warrants zero scores. No significant adjustments are necessary; ongoing monitoring is recommended if further code details become available.",
