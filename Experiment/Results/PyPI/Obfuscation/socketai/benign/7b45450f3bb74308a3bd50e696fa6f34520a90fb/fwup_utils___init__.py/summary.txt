  "conclusion": "The reports' scoring and reasoning are appropriate given the available information. For suspicious patterns described in Report 4, a slightly higher malware score (around 0.45) and obfuscation (around 0.75) are justified. The absence of code in other reports warrants zero scores. No significant adjustments are necessary; ongoing monitoring is recommended if further code details become available."
