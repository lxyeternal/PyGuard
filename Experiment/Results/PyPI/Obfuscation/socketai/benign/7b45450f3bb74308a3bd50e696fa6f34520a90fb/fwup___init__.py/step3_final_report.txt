{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. It likely performs standard data processing or configuration tasks without malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, processes data, possibly communicates over the network (if present), or performs standard library calls.",
  "sinks": "Potentially where untrusted data from environment variables or input sources could influence behavior, such as network communication or file operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources like environment variables or input functions to sinks such as network sockets, file writes, or system commands, but no malicious patterns are observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code structure appears straightforward, with no obfuscation, suspicious function calls, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs. It reads environment variables and performs standard processing. No malicious activity, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network connections, is evident. The confidence score is high (0.9), given the lack of suspicious patterns. The security risk is low (0.2), reflecting a conservative estimate acknowledging potential unverified input sources. No anomalies or obfuscation are present, and the overall assessment indicates a benign, safe codebase.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is zero. The analysis supports that the dependency is safe for use.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
