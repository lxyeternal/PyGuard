{
  "purpose": "The code defines two custom exception classes inheriting from IOError, each containing a class-level variable with an obfuscated string.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and class variables initialized with strings.",
  "sinks": "No data input, output, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; classes and variables are static and not used for data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Classes are named with seemingly random strings; class variables contain obfuscated strings that are not utilized or explained. No usage of dynamic code execution, external input, or network activity. The code appears to be designed to obscure or obfuscate intent, possibly to evade detection or for malicious concealment.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two class definitions inheriting from IOError, with each class having a class attribute containing an obfuscated string. There is no evidence of input handling, data processing, or output. The naming conventions are unusual and resemble obfuscated or maliciously styled code, but no actual malicious actions or behavior are observable within this fragment. The static strings are not used elsewhere, and no malicious activities like network calls or data exfiltration are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be obfuscated class definitions containing hidden strings but does not demonstrate malicious behavior or security risks in its current form. It might be part of larger obfuscated code or intentionally hidden code segments, but as is, it poses no security threat.",
