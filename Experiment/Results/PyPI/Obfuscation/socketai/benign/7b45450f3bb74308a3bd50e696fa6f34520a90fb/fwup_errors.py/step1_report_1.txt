{
  "purpose": "The code defines two custom exception classes that inherit from IOError, with class attributes containing seemingly random strings.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and their class attribute assignments.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks, such as data output, network calls, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is apparent; the code only declares classes with static attributes.",
  "anomalies": "Class names and attribute values appear obfuscated or meaningless, containing random strings. No functional or meaningful code is present. The classes inherit from IOError but do not override or implement additional behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code introduces two custom exception classes inheriting from IOError, each containing a class attribute with a seemingly random string. There are no functions, data handling, or interactions that suggest malicious behavior. The obfuscated names and random strings could be an attempt at hiding intent or simply obfuscation, but with no further code, there is no evidence of malicious activity. The code's purpose appears benign or placeholder in nature.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is minimal, defining custom exception classes with random string attributes. No malicious behavior, backdoors, data exfiltration, or security risks are evident. The obfuscation appears superficial, with no clear malicious intent.",
