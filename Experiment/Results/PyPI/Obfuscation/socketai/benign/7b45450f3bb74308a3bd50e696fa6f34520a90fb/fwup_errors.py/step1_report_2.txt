{
  "purpose": "The code defines two custom exception classes inheriting from IOError, each with a class attribute containing a seemingly random string.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and class attribute assignments.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that process untrusted data or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only declares classes and attributes.",
  "anomalies": "Class names and attribute values appear obfuscated or randomly generated, with no apparent functional purpose. No input handling, data processing, or external interactions are present.",
  "analysis": "The code creates two subclasses of IOError with obscure class names and assigns string attributes that appear to be random sequences. There is no logic, data processing, input/output, or network activity. These classes could be placeholders or intentionally obfuscated, but as written, they do not perform any harmful actions. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The code lacks any flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks, and no suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be benign, consisting solely of class declarations with obscure names and attributes. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks in this fragment.",
