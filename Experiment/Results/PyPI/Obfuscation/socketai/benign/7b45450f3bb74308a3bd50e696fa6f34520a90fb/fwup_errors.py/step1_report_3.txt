{
  "purpose": "The code defines two custom exception classes inheriting from IOError, with obfuscated class and variable names and assigned string attributes.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources; only class definitions and string assignments.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leak points; no external data handling or untrusted data flows.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only contains class definitions and attribute assignments.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and attribute names, which can be suspicious if used to conceal malicious intent. No other code behavior is present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two custom exception classes inheriting from IOError, with names and attribute values that appear intentionally obfuscated. There are no data inputs, external communications, or operations performed within these classes. The obfuscation could be benign or malicious; however, given only this code snippet, it is typical of obfuscation strategies used to hide malicious intent or evade detection. The absence of active logic, external calls, or data handling reduces immediate concern, but the obfuscation warrants caution.\n\nNo malware behaviors such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident in this snippet. The class definitions do not perform any malicious actions on their own.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple class definitions with obfuscated naming, which could be an attempt to conceal malicious intent, but on its own, it shows no active malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation is suspicious but not definitively malicious based solely on this code.",
