{
  "purpose": "The code defines two custom exception classes inheriting from IOError, with static string attributes. It appears to serve as placeholder or obfuscated code with no active malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and static attribute assignments within the classes.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks, external calls, or untrusted data flows present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists; the code is inert with static attributes only.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class names and attribute values, which could be superficial obfuscation or placeholder code; no active logic or external interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two class definitions inheriting from IOError, with class attributes assigned to seemingly random strings. There are no functions, data flows, or external interactions. The obfuscation may be superficial, serving as placeholders or to hinder readability, but does not exhibit malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The malware score remains at 0, and the security risk is minimal. Confidence in benign assessment is high, but the obfuscation warrants cautious monitoring if part of a larger codebase.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting of obfuscated class definitions with static strings and no active malicious or security-threatening behavior. The obfuscation alone does not imply malicious intent but should be noted for further context. Scores are consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.8,
