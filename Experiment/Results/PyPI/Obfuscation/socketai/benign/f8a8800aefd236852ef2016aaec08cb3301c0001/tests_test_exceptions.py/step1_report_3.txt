{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite using pytest to verify exception subclasses and instantiation behavior.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from the parameterized exception references within the code and pytest's runtime environment.",
  "sinks": "The code raises exceptions and uses type assertions, but does not write to external systems or handle untrusted external input.",
  "flows": "The test function raises exceptions based on parameterized input, verifying their class hierarchy and instance behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious logic observed. Exception classes are imported from a local module, no external input or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a pytest test that parameterizes exception class references and expected class names. It checks that exception classes are subclasses of a base class, can be instantiated correctly, and that raising them triggers the expected exceptions. All operations are within testing context and do not involve external data, network, or system modification. No anomalies, malicious behavior, or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard test suite for exception classes, with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
