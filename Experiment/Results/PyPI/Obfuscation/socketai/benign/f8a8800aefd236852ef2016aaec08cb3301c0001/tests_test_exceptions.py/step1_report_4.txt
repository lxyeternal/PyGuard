  "purpose": "The code is a test suite that verifies the behavior of exception classes in the 'dissect.ffs.exceptions' module using pytest.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, pytest, and dissect.ffs.exceptions; parameterized test data.",
  "sinks": "Assertions raising and checking exceptions.",
  "flows": "Test data is used to instantiate exceptions, which are then checked for correct inheritance and behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. The code appears to be standard test code with no malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a parameterized pytest function to test exception classes, and performs assertions on their inheritance and instantiation. It utilizes typical testing patterns without any suspicious logic, external network calls, or obfuscated constructs. No hidden code or malicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward test suite for exception classes with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
