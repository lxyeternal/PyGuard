{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a test suite using pytest to validate exception classes from the dissect.ffs.exceptions module.",
  "sources": "The code reads exception class references from the exceptions module and data from pytest parameterization.",
  "sinks": "The code raises exceptions which are expected to be subclasses of Exception, and checks their types.",
  "flows": "Input data (parameterized exceptions) flows into exception class references, which are then used to instantiate and raise exceptions; assertions verify class inheritance and instance type.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. Usage of exception classes is standard. The parameterization includes seemingly random variable names but nothing malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pytest and a module containing exceptions. It uses parameterization to run tests on multiple exception classes. The test function checks whether each exception class is a subclass of Exception and whether instantiating it results in an instance of the expected type. It then verifies that raising these exceptions behaves as expected. All operations are typical for testing exception hierarchies. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activities are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard test suite validating exception classes. There are no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. The code is benign and purely for testing purposes.",
