  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code input, data handling functions, network connections, environment variables, file operations.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission, file writing, environment variable access, system commands.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input or environment variables to sinks like network or file operations, indicating potential data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity, and no malicious functions detected.",
  "analysis": "All reports lack concrete code snippets, relying on summaries. The analyses correctly identify no malicious or obfuscated code, with high confidence levels where code is present. The low security risk scores (0.2) are justified, reflecting cautious assessment of potential untrusted data handling. Zero malware and obfuscation scores are consistent across reports. The reasoning aligns with the absence of suspicious patterns or behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analyses. No adjustments are necessary.",
