{
  "purpose": "The code defines several custom exception classes, potentially for use in a larger application or library.",
  "sources": "Class definitions are the primary data sources; no external input or data reading is evident.",
  "targets": "No clear sinks or data flows to sensitive operations, external data, or system commands are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only declares class hierarchies without operational logic.",
  "anomalies": "Class names are obfuscated with random strings, which can be suspicious; no functionality or behavior is implemented. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code solely contains class definitions inheriting from exception classes with obfuscated names. There are no functions, input handling, or external interactions. The obfuscated class names could be an attempt to hide intent, but without additional code, there's no evidence of malicious activity. The structure is minimal and doesn't perform any operations, making malicious behavior unlikely based solely on this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a set of obfuscated custom exception classes without any malicious logic. The obfuscation might be for code hiding or simply for naming, but there is no active malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity detected in this snippet.",
