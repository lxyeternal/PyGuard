{
  "purpose": "The code defines several custom exception classes, potentially for use in error handling within a larger application.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are read in this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks such as data output, network communication, or file operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists in this code; it solely defines classes.",
  "anomalies": "All class names are obfuscated, consisting of random or nonsensical strings. No meaningful or descriptive names are used. The classes only inherit from a common base exception class, with no additional logic or attributes.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple custom exception class definitions with obfuscated class names. There are no functions, data processing, or external interactions. The use of random class names and lack of functionality suggests obfuscation or an attempt to hide intent. However, there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity, data theft, or system compromise. The code appears to be a minimal, obfuscated set of class definitions, possibly intended to be part of a larger, obscured package.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks on its own. Its obfuscated naming might suggest an attempt to conceal purpose, but it lacks any active malicious features or suspicious operations. It appears to be benign, possibly obfuscated error class definitions.",
