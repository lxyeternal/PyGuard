{
  "purpose": "The code defines multiple obfuscated exception classes inheriting from a base exception class, likely serving as placeholders or part of a larger obfuscated codebase.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from Exception, with obfuscated class names",
  "sinks": "None present; no data input, output, or external interactions",
  "flows": "No data or control flow; class inheritance without operational logic",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class names with nonsensical strings, no functional code or data processing",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions with obfuscated names inheriting from Exception, with no functions or external interactions. No malicious code, data leaks, or system modifications are evident. The obfuscation appears to be purely in naming, which could be suspicious but is not inherently malicious. The scores assigned in the reports—malware=0, obfuscated=0.8-0.9, security risk=0.2—are consistent with the code's content. Given the absence of active malicious behavior, the code appears benign, with obfuscation being the primary concern but not indicative of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of obfuscated exception class definitions with no malicious activity detected. The high obfuscation score is justified, but the malware score remains zero. The low security risk score reflects the lack of active threats. Overall, the code appears benign, and the scores are appropriate.",
