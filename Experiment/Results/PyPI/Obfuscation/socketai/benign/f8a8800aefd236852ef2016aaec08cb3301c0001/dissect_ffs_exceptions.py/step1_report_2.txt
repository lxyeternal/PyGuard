{
  "purpose": "The code defines several custom exception classes, potentially used for error handling within a larger application.",
  "sources": "Class definitions; no input reading, external data access, or environment variable usage.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling, no network, file, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; only class inheritance is defined.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual class names with random characters; no functional code, no logic, no data processing. No signs of obfuscation or malicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class declarations inheriting from a base exception class, with highly obfuscated class names. There are no functions, no data processing, no input/output operations. The absence of operational code suggests no malicious behavior. The obfuscated naming could be to hide intent, but on its own, it does not indicate malicious activity. Lack of any network, file, or environment interaction further reduces concern.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be purely a set of custom exception class declarations with obfuscated names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks in this fragment. The design does not perform any harmful operations.",
