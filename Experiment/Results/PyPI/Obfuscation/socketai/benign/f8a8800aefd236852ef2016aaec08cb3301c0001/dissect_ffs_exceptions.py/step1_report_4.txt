  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for use in Python code, with some classes inheriting from others.",
  "sources": "Class definitions, inheriting from a common base exception class.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as data output, network communication, or command execution are present.",
  "flows": "Inheritance hierarchy; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Class names appear as random strings, no meaningful or descriptive naming, no code execution, or logic present. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code solely contains class declarations inheriting from a base exception class. The class names are obfuscated, but they do not perform any actions, data processing, or external interactions. There are no sources, sinks, or data flows that could indicate malicious behavior. The code does not contain any potentially dangerous constructs, such as dynamic execution, network calls, or file operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, obfuscated set of exception class definitions with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. The obfuscated class names do not suggest malicious intent; they seem to serve as placeholders or part of a larger, perhaps intentionally obfuscated codebase.",
