  "purpose": "Static definitions of filesystem data structures for analysis or parsing purposes.",
  "sources": "The large string containing C typedefs and struct definitions, loaded via cstruct().load().",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or data at runtime.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the code only loads static schema definitions into a data structure.",
  "anomalies": "The large static string may seem unusual but is simply schema data, not malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely static, defining filesystem metadata structures with no runtime behavior, network activity, or data handling. It contains no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads. Loading the schema into a cstruct object is a standard setup step for filesystem analysis tools. No signs of malware, sabotage, or suspicious activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static setup for filesystem structure definitions, with no indicators of malware or security risk.",
