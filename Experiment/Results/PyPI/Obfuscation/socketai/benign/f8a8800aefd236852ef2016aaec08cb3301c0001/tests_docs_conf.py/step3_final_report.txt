  "purpose": "Configuration parameters for Sphinx documentation build, including extensions, paths, and options.",
  "sources": "Static variable assignments, no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "None; static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, but no malicious code or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments configuring Sphinx extensions and options. Variable names are obfuscated, which could be stylistic or an attempt to conceal, but no dynamic code execution, network activity, or sensitive data are present. No functions, input/output operations, or external data handling are observed. The obfuscation does not correlate with malicious intent, and the code does not perform any harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign static configuration script for Sphinx documentation with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The high obfuscation score is justified by variable naming but does not imply malicious intent. The overall security risk is negligible.",
