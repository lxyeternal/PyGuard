  "purpose": "Utility functions for constructing file paths relative to the script and opening gzipped binary files for testing or data processing.",
  "sources": "Filename input parameters used in path construction and gzip file opening functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data leading to data leaks or system effects; code only reads files.",
  "flows": "Filename parameters are used to generate paths and open files; no further data flow or processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated function and variable names, which reduces readability but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard libraries for file handling, with straightforward logic. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code patterns are present. Obfuscated naming is the main anomaly, potentially aimed at hiding purpose but not malicious. The functions serve as utilities for reading gzipped files, likely in testing contexts. No hardcoded secrets or vulnerabilities are evident. The low malware and security risk scores are justified; obfuscation is noted but does not imply malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as utility functions for reading gzipped files. Obfuscation is the only concern but does not translate into security risks or malicious intent. Scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
