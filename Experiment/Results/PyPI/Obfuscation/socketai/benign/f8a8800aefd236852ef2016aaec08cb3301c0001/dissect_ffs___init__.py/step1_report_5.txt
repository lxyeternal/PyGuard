  "purpose": "The code imports specific classes or functions from the dissect.ffs.exceptions and dissect.ffs.ffs modules and defines an export list.",
  "sources": "Import statements from dissect.ffs.exceptions and dissect.ffs.ffs modules.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data are present; only import statements and an __all__ list.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths are evident in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The imported identifiers are nonsensical and appear to be obfuscated or auto-generated names; no meaningful names or credentials are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with seemingly random, obfuscated class/function names, and an __all__ list defining exported symbols. There are no data inputs, no processing, no network interactions, or suspicious logic. The naming pattern suggests either obfuscation or autogenerated code, but nothing inherently malicious or suspicious is present. No side effects or malicious behaviors are detectable in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import and export definition with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The obscured names do not indicate malicious intent but could suggest obfuscation or code generation. Overall, the snippet appears benign.",
