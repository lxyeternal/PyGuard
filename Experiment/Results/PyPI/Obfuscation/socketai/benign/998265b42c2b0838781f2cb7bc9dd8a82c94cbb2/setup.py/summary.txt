  "conclusion": "The majority of reports correctly identify benign code with low security risks, while Report 3's high obfuscation and dynamic execution signals justify elevated malware and risk scores. The scoring aligns with the evidence, and no adjustments are necessary. The overall assessment suggests that the dependency is likely safe, except for the suspicious patterns in Report 3, which should be investigated further before deployment."
