  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a Python script that performs some form of data processing or network interaction, but the specific intent cannot be determined without additional context.",
  "sources": "Data is read from environment variables, input functions, or possibly network sources; however, the code snippet provided does not specify explicit data sources.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, file writes, or system commands, but no specific suspicious sinks are identified in the provided code.",
  "flows": "No explicit source-to-sink data flow is observable from the code snippet provided; further code context is needed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs are evident. The code uses standard Python features without obfuscation or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed for malicious patterns, including data leakage, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. It contains no signs of malware such as data exfiltration, hidden network connections, or cryptomining activities. Usage of third-party libraries is not inherently suspicious. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated sections, or malicious logic were observed. The structure appears typical for a data processing or utility script.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with no indications of malware, sabotage, or supply chain attacks.",
