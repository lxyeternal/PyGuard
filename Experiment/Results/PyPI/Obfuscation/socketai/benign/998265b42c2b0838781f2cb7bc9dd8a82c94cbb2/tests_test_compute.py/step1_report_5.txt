  "purpose": "The code appears to be a Python script that performs some operations, but the specific purpose is unclear due to lack of context and minimal code provided.",
  "sources": "Any input functions, environment variable reads, file reads, or network requests present in the code.",
  "sinks": "Any data being sent over network connections, written to files, or used in system commands, especially if data originates from untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Paths from input sources to sensitive sinks, such as network or file operations, through variable usage.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual import statements. In the provided snippet, no such anomalies are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code was examined for typical security concerns such as input handling, data leaks, suspicious network activity, and obfuscated patterns. The code snippet appears minimal or empty, with no evident malicious functions, network connections, or obfuscated elements. Without additional context or code, there are no apparent anomalies or malicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems benign, but the lack of substantive content limits confidence in this assessment.",
