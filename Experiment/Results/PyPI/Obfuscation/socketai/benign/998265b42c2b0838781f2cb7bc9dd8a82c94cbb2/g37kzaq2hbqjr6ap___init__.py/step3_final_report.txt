  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, network requests, subprocess calls, user input, environment data, imported libraries.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, subprocess execution, environment variables, logging outputs, data flows into system or network functions.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or user input to sinks like network requests or subprocess calls, potentially leading to data exfiltration or command execution.",
  "anomalies": "Potential obfuscation (e.g., eval(), exec()), use of subprocess and network functions without validation, but no concrete evidence of malicious code or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code summaries indicate mostly benign behavior with standard data handling. Reports agree on low malware and obfuscation scores, with some moderate security risk due to subprocess and network usage. No explicit malicious patterns or suspicious activity are confirmed. The scores are consistent with the descriptions, and no significant issues are detected. The highest suspicion is in Report 3, which mentions potential obfuscation and dynamic code execution, but without concrete code snippets, suspicion remains moderate. Overall, the assessments are cautious and appropriate, with no adjustments necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with minimal security risks. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified. The moderate risk scores reflect potential misuse but lack concrete malicious activity. The evaluations are consistent and appropriate given the available information.",
