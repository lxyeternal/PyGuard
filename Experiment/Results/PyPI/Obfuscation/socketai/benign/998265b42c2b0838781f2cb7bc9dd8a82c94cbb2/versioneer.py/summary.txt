  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate version management utility, possibly generated or obfuscated for concealment. No active malicious activity or sabotage is evident. The high obfuscation warrants caution, but the overall behavior is consistent with standard version control and release tooling. Therefore, the malware score should remain low (~0.1), obfuscation high (~0.75), and overall security risk moderate (~0.3)."
