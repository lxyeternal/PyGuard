  "purpose": "Static import statements from Huawei SDK with obfuscated class names, no executable logic or network activity.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing classes from the Huawei SDK modules.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows are present; code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow or source-to-sink paths; only static imports.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation in class names, which is unusual for standard SDK code and may indicate code generation or concealment.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with obfuscated class names, with no executable logic, network activity, or data manipulation. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not demonstrate malicious intent. Malware scores are appropriately zero; obfuscation scores are high (~0.75), reflecting suspicion. Risk scores are low (~0.2), consistent with static, benign import statements. The confidence in these assessments is moderate to high, given the absence of active malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static set of import statements from an SDK with obfuscated identifiers. No malicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident from this fragment. The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the supply chain appears safe based on this snippet, with low malware and risk scores.",
