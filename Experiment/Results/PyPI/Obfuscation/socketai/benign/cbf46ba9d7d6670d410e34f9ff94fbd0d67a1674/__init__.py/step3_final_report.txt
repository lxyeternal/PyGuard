  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Standard modules (`pip`, `setuptools`, `distutils`, `pkg_resources`, `importlib`) for environment setup; data input/output operations; no external or untrusted sources indicated.",
  "sinks": "Potential subprocess calls, environment modifications, data output, or network connections (not explicitly present).",
  "flows": "Input data from environment or files to processing functions; no suspicious data flows or external communications identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. Code appears standard and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is either absent or consists of standard environment management and benign data processing routines. No suspicious patterns, malicious code, or obfuscation are present. The code's benign nature is supported by the lack of external network activity, secrets, or unusual constructs. The confidence in benign assessment is high where code exists; low where code is missing or only described.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency code shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly assign low malware and obfuscation scores. Risk scores are appropriately low, reflecting benign or incomplete code. No adjustments are necessary; the overall security posture is considered safe based on the provided information.",
