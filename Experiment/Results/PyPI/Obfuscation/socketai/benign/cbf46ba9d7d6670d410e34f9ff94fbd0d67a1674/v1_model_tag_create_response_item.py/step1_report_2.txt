{
  "purpose": "Define a data model class for Huawei Cloud SDK to represent resource error details.",
  "sources": "The class constructor (__init__) reads data from parameters; properties assign data to internal variables.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data are present; no network, file, or external system interactions are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor parameters into class attributes through setters; no external data flows observed.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual code structure, such as inconsistent indentation, misaligned return statements within setters, and possibly malformed property methods. Presence of code comments in Chinese indicating resource identifiers and error info, but no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with class variables and properties for managing resource error info. The constructor initializes attributes based on input parameters, which are documented as resource IDs, types, and error messages. Setters and getters are defined, although some appear malformed with misplaced return statements, indicating poor coding practice rather than malicious intent. No network activity, dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected. The class appears to be a standard data container, likely auto-generated or boilerplate for SDK use.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign data model class with some code quality issues but no malicious intent. No indicators of malware or security risks are present.",
