{
  "purpose": "This code defines a data model class representing resource error information, likely used within an SDK or API client.",
  "sources": "The __init__ method parameters, class variables, and property setters/readers.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; no network calls, file writes, or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor parameters to class attributes via property setters; no external untrusted data sources or sinks detected.",
  "anomalies": "Invalid 'return' statements outside methods, inconsistent property method definitions, obfuscated variable names, and structural anomalies suggest obfuscation or auto-generation artifacts.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits obfuscation and structural anomalies such as misplaced 'return' statements and inconsistent property definitions. These issues prevent proper execution and indicate superficial obfuscation or code generation artifacts. No evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection is present. The anomalies are likely benign but could be used to hide malicious intent if part of a larger malicious payload.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be an obfuscated or auto-generated data container class with structural anomalies. There is no evidence of malicious activity, but the obfuscation and poor structure warrant cautious review if integrated into larger systems. The malware score is set to 0, the obfuscation score to approximately 0.75, and the security risk score to around 0.2, reflecting low active threat but notable obfuscation.",
