{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Python class used to model error information related to resources, likely for API responses in Huawei Cloud SDK.",
  "sources": "The class initializes with parameters for resource ID, resource type, error code, and error message.",
  "sinks": "The code does not include any external data sinks or network operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor parameters into class attributes; no external or untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The class has inconsistent method definitions: getter methods return attribute names but are improperly annotated with 'return self._attribute', which is syntactically incorrect. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code are present. No obfuscation or malicious code patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward class definition with properties for resource error info. It contains unusual method structures—getter methods with 'return self._attribute' statements placed after the setter definitions, which is syntactically incorrect and indicates poor coding practice but not malicious intent. No network calls, file operations, or suspicious behaviors are present. No hardcoded credentials or malicious logic are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a poorly implemented data model class with no malicious intent or security risks. The unusual method structure may indicate incomplete or incorrectly generated code but does not suggest malicious activity.",
