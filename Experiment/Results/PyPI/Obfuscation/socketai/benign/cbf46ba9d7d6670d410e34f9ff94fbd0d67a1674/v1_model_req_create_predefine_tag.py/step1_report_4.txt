  "purpose": "Definition of a Python class representing a model for Huawei Cloud SDK, including attributes and property setters/getters.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class attributes, __init__ method, property setter methods.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data sinks or external interactions observed.",
  "flows": "Initialization of class attributes, setting properties via setters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code. The code is a straightforward class definition with standard property methods.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a data model class with class attributes, a constructor, and property setters and getters. The import of 'six' and 'sanitize_for_serialization' suggests compatibility and serialization utilities but do not indicate malicious intent. No external data input, network calls, or execution of untrusted code is present. The class structure appears to be typical for SDK models, with no anomalies, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard SDK model class with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be designed for data encapsulation and serialization within the Huawei Cloud SDK, with no suspicious or harmful logic.",
