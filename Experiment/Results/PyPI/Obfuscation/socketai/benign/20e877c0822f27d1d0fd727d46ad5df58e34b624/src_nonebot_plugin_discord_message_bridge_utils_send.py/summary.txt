  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated and interacts with external URLs without validation, indicating potential misuse or malicious intent. While no direct malware or payloads are detected, the suspicious patterns justify a moderate to high security concern. The overall malware score is low to moderate, and obfuscation is high. Further full-code review and runtime analysis are recommended before deployment or trust."
