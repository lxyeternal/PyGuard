  "obfuscated": 0.4,
  "confidence": 0.75,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits behaviors that could be exploited maliciously, such as data exfiltration during message recall, credential mishandling via environment variables, and persistent bot management through threading. While no active payloads are detected, the suspicious practices and network interactions warrant cautious review. The overall security risk is moderate, with a malware likelihood around 0.3–0.4, obfuscation at about 0.4, and a security risk score near 0.6."
