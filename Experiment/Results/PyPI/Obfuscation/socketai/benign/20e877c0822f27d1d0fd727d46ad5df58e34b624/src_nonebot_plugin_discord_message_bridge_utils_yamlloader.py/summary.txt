  "conclusion": "The code appears primarily as a configuration handler with some obfuscation. There is no concrete evidence of malicious activity, but the obfuscated identifiers and local module warrant cautious review. The supply chain risk is low but not negligible. Further investigation into the local module and URL legitimacy is recommended."
