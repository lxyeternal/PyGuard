  "purpose": "Static variable declarations with obfuscated names imported from a local config module, likely for internal configuration or state management.",
  "sources": "Import from .config; variable initializations",
  "sinks": "None in this fragment; no data flows or external outputs",
  "flows": "No active data or control flows; only static assignments",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; import with wildcard from a local module",
  "analysis": "The code imports everything from a local module, then declares multiple variables with non-descriptive, obfuscated names, initialized to default values. No functions, data processing, network activity, or other logic are present. The obfuscation may be suspicious but is not inherently malicious. The absence of active code or external communication suggests low risk. The import from '.config' could be benign or malicious depending on its content, but this cannot be assessed statically. Overall, the code appears benign, with obfuscation being the main red flag, which warrants further review of the imported module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is static, with obfuscated variable names and no active behavior. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities in this fragment. The high obfuscation score reflects the variable naming, but the malware and risk scores are low, consistent with the static nature. Further review of the imported '.config' module is recommended to confirm overall safety.",
