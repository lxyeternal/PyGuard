  "conclusion": "The code is static, with obfuscated variable names and no active behavior. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities in this fragment. The high obfuscation score reflects the variable naming, but the malware and risk scores are low, consistent with the static nature. Further review of the imported '.config' module is recommended to confirm overall safety."
