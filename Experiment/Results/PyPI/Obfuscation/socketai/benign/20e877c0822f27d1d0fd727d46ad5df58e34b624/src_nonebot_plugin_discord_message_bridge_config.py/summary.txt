  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration setup with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious payloads. The risk is minimal, primarily related to default values which are common in configuration files. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1)."
