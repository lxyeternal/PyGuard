  "purpose": "Define a configuration model for a plugin, loading settings from a public plugin configuration.",
  "sources": "get_plugin_config function call, reading data from configuration object properties",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data flows leading to untrusted operations observed",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from plugin config to local variables, no untrusted data flow to system or network",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious patterns detected; the code simply loads and assigns configuration values.",
  "analysis": "The code imports configuration, defines a data model with default values, and loads configuration from a plugin. All data appears to be static, configuration-based, with no dynamic input handling, code injection, or network activity. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or anomalies observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward configuration loader for a plugin, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
