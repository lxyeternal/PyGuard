      "obfuscated": 0.4,
      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits behaviors that could be exploited maliciously, such as data exfiltration during message recall, credential mishandling via environment variables, and persistent bot management through threading. While no active payloads are detected, the suspicious practices and network interactions warrant cautious review. The overall security risk is moderate, with a malware likelihood around 0.3–0.4, obfuscation at about 0.4, and a security risk score near 0.6."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is static, with obfuscated variable names and no active behavior. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities in this fragment. The high obfuscation score reflects the variable naming, but the malware and risk scores are low, consistent with the static nature. Further review of the imported '.config' module is recommended to confirm overall safety."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration setup with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious payloads. The risk is minimal, primarily related to default values which are common in configuration files. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1)."

      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated and interacts with external URLs without validation, indicating potential misuse or malicious intent. While no direct malware or payloads are detected, the suspicious patterns justify a moderate to high security concern. The overall malware score is low to moderate, and obfuscation is high. Further full-code review and runtime analysis are recommended before deployment or trust."

The malware score is 0, and the security risk is low (~0.2). The obfuscation is moderate but not malicious. The assessments in the reports are consistent and justified."

      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code appears primarily as a configuration handler with some obfuscation. There is no concrete evidence of malicious activity, but the obfuscated identifiers and local module warrant cautious review. The supply chain risk is low but not negligible. Further investigation into the local module and URL legitimacy is recommended."

      "obfuscated": 0.7,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is a typical message processing routine with heavy obfuscation but no malicious behavior. The malware score is correctly set to 0. The obfuscation score is justified at approximately 0.7 due to variable naming. The security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate given the lack of validation and potential for misuse, but no active threats are present."

The scores from the reports are consistent with this assessment. Vigilance is recommended when deploying, especially regarding input sanitization and configuration integrity."
