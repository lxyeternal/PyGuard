      "conclusion": "The code is a benign package configuration script with obfuscation but no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The high obfuscation score reflects variable name obscurity, but malware and security risk scores are low, consistent with the static, non-malicious nature of the code."

      "conclusion": "The script is a network report automation tool with significant security risks due to unsafe command execution and credential handling. There is no evidence of malware or sabotage. The low malware score is justified, but the security risk is moderate to high because of potential exploitation avenues."

The scores are appropriate given the suspicion, but definitive conclusions require inspecting the imported module's content. Caution is advised, and further investigation is recommended."
