{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package using setuptools, configuring package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Static variable definitions for package configuration, including dependencies and entry points.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, network activity, or dynamic code execution present.",
  "flows": "Variables are assigned static data and passed directly to setup(), with no external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Heavily obfuscated variable names; 'long_description' appears incomplete or malformed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names, no malicious logic, and no dynamic or network activity. The obfuscation may be for concealment but does not indicate malicious intent. The malformed 'long_description' is likely an oversight. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious dependencies are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package configuration script with obfuscation but no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The high obfuscation score reflects variable name obscurity, but malware and security risk scores are low, consistent with the static, non-malicious nature of the code.",
