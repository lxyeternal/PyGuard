  "purpose": "The code appears to assign a version string to a variable, possibly indicating a package version.",
  "sources": "Assignment of a static string value to a variable",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to external systems or untrusted sources are present",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths exist",
  "anomalies": "The variable name and value seem arbitrary; no meaningful code logic or external data handling is present; no indication of obfuscation or malicious code",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple assignment of a version string to a variable with an obfuscated or nonsensical variable name. There are no input sources, data processing, or external communication. No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or data leakage. The pattern resembles minimal obfuscation but lacks any functional or malicious intent. It appears benign and may serve as a placeholder or obfuscated version info.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, representing a version assignment with no malicious or security concerns. No suspicious activity detected.",
