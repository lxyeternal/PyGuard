{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for a Python package named 'legacy' for distribution and installation.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded package metadata, including name, version, author info, description, license, keywords, URL, classifiers, and package data.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external inputs processed.",
  "flows": "The setup function uses static metadata; no dynamic data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated or unusual variable names such as 'oGeTPacvvEpjJZCwkytxsWjVUWCUUyFv' and 'FGwikehVuPzBArsaJbAUCUgMYnIXijAX' which appear as random strings, but are assigned to package data or configurations; no malicious code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools for Python package configuration. It includes typical package metadata with an extensive list of supported Python versions. Unusual variable names are present but seem to be obfuscated or intentionally obscure, yet they do not influence the setup process or contain malicious logic. No external data inputs, network calls, or executable code beyond the standard setup process are present. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup configuration script with obfuscated variable names. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. The code appears safe and intended solely for package distribution.",
