{
  "purpose": "Unit testing for the 'legacy' module functions, verifying behavior with specific inputs.",
  "sources": "Import statements ('import unittest', 'import legacy', 'import sys') and input parameters within function calls.",
  "sinks": "Function calls to 'legacy' module functions, type checks, and assertions; no external data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters passed to 'legacy' functions; no untrusted data flow to external systems or network.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import of 'sys', creation of variables with obfuscated or non-descriptive names, no clear secrets or credentials, no use of environment variables or network operations. No suspicious code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard unittest structure testing functions from a 'legacy' module. It performs equality checks and type assertions without involving external data sources, network operations, or sensitive data. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior observed. The code appears to be legitimate unit tests with obfuscated variable names but no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical unit test suite with obfuscated variable names but no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. No suspicious or harmful code detected.",
