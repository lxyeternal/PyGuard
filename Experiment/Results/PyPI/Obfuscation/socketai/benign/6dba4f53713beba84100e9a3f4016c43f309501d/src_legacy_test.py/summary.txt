  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign unit tests with obfuscated identifiers. No malicious behavior or active security threats are evident. The primary concern is the obfuscation and reliance on an unverified external module, which should be reviewed separately. The malware score should remain at 0 or very close to it, the obfuscation score around 0.6-0.7, and the security risk score at approximately 0.2."
