      "conclusion": "The code is a complex, obfuscated DNS resolver that does not show direct signs of malicious payloads but employs techniques (heavy obfuscation, dynamic socket handling, suspicious imports) that could be used to hide malicious activities. The overall suspicion is moderate, warranting cautious handling and further dynamic analysis."
