  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated API client for NotifyMyAndroid with no detected malicious behavior. The obfuscation is a concern but not sufficient to classify the code as malicious. Malware score is 0, obfuscation score around 0.5, and low security risk (~0.2). Static analysis supports a safe assessment, though further runtime monitoring is recommended if deployed in sensitive environments."
