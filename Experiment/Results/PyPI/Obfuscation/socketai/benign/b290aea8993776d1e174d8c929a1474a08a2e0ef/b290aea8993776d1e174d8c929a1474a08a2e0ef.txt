      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal setup script with an obfuscated package name. No malicious behavior is detected, but the obfuscation warrants a higher suspicion score. Overall, the supply chain risk is low, with the primary concern being concealment rather than active malicious activity."

      "conclusion": "The import statement's obfuscated nature warrants caution, but without evidence of malicious activity, the code appears benign. The scores assigned are appropriate, reflecting suspicion due to obfuscation but no confirmed malicious behavior. Further analysis of the 'pynma' module is advised to clarify intent."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated API client for NotifyMyAndroid with no detected malicious behavior. The obfuscation is a concern but not sufficient to classify the code as malicious. Malware score is 0, obfuscation score around 0.5, and low security risk (~0.2). Static analysis supports a safe assessment, though further runtime monitoring is recommended if deployed in sensitive environments."
