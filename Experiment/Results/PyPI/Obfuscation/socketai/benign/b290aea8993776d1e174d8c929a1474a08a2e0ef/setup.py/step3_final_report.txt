  "purpose": "Minimal setup script defining package metadata with a potentially obfuscated package name.",
  "sources": "Static package name and version in setup() call; no external input or dynamic data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external data flows present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static data used in setup() without any data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated package name 'q8hqlvafjl2c755q'; unused import 'find_packages' which suggests possible obfuscation or incomplete code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with no malicious code, network activity, or dynamic behavior. The only suspicious aspect is the obfuscated package name, which could be used to conceal malicious intent but is not evidence of malicious activity on its own. The import of 'find_packages' is unused, indicating potential obfuscation or incomplete code, but not malicious. Scores reflect the benign nature: malware=0, obfuscated=0.7, securityRisk=0.2, consistent with the suspicion raised by the package name.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal setup script with an obfuscated package name. No malicious behavior is detected, but the obfuscation warrants a higher suspicion score. Overall, the supply chain risk is low, with the primary concern being concealment rather than active malicious activity.",
