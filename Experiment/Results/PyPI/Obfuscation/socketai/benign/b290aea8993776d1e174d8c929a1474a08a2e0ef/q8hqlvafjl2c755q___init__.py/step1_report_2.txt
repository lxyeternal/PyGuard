  "flows": "No data flows beyond the import statement",
  "anomalies": "Importing a module with an obfuscated name (ZTViEcdNtQxeVyFqpvmIjPENvtotUwpc), which could be used to conceal malicious intent",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple relative import from a module named 'pynma' and assigns it an obscure name. The module name appears randomly generated or obfuscated, which can be a tactic to hide malicious code. There are no other code actions, network operations, or data handling shown. The import alone is suspicious because it may load malicious code hidden within the module, but no further context is provided to determine behavior. The absence of any other code or comments limits the assessment, but the obfuscated import suggests potential malicious intent or concealment.",
  "conclusion": "The code imports an obscurely named module, which could be used to conceal malicious behavior. Without additional code or context, the risk is indeterminate, but the obfuscation raises suspicion of concealment.",
