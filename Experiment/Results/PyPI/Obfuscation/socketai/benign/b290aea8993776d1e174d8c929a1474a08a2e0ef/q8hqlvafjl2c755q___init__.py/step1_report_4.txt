  "purpose": "Import a potentially obfuscated or dynamically named module or object from a local package",
  "sources": "The import statement, which loads '.pynma' module and its attribute 'ZTViEcdNtQxeVyFqpvmIjPENvtotUwpc'",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network or file operations are present",
  "flows": "Import statement reads the module and attribute, but no further data flow is visible",
  "anomalies": "The attribute name 'ZTViEcdNtQxeVyFqpvmIjPENvtotUwpc' appears obfuscated or randomly generated; no code execution or logic present",
  "analysis": "The code imports a single attribute from a local module, with the attribute name being a long, seemingly random string. There are no functions, classes, data processing, or network operations. The module path indicates a relative import, which could be legitimate but combined with the obfuscated attribute name, suggests potential concealment or obfuscation. No suspicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code execution, or malicious actions is observable.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal and appears to be part of an obfuscated or intentionally obscured import. There is no evidence of malicious activity or malicious code in this snippet. However, the obfuscated naming warrants caution, but based solely on this fragment, no malicious intent is identifiable.",
