  "purpose": "Minimal import statement from a local module with obfuscated attribute name, potentially hiding malicious code.",
  "sources": "Import statement reading from '.pynma' module and attribute 'ZTViEcdNtQxeVyFqpvmIjPENvtotUwpc'. No other data inputs or external sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions affecting system security.",
  "flows": "Import source from module to local namespace; no further data flow or execution paths shown.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated module and attribute names suggest concealment; minimal code with no context or logic; reliance on obfuscated identifiers.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet performs a simple import from a relative module, with an obfuscated attribute name, which raises suspicion of concealment or malicious intent. The minimal nature of the code prevents any definitive conclusion about malicious behavior. The high obfuscation score (around 0.8) is justified, but the malware score remains low (~0.2-0.3) due to lack of evidence of malicious activity. The overall security risk is moderate (~0.3), primarily due to obfuscation, but no direct threats are demonstrated. The suspicion is solely based on naming obfuscation; further investigation of the 'pynma' module's contents is recommended before any action.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement's obfuscated nature warrants caution, but without evidence of malicious activity, the code appears benign. The scores assigned are appropriate, reflecting suspicion due to obfuscation but no confirmed malicious behavior. Further analysis of the 'pynma' module is advised to clarify intent.",
