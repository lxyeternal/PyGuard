{
  "purpose": "Importing a possibly obfuscated or malicious module named 'pynma' and a specific class or function with a non-descriptive name.",
  "sources": "The import statement importing 'ZTViEcdNtQxeVyFqpvmIjPENvtotUwpc' from the module '.pynma'.",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of the imported object if used later, but not shown here.",
  "flows": "Import statement may load code from the module, but no further flow is provided.",
  "anomalies": "The module name 'pynma' and object name 'ZTViEcdNtQxeVyFqpvmIjPENvtotUwpc' appear obfuscated or intentionally obscure, which is suspicious. No other code provided to analyze behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement from a relative module. The module and attribute names are non-descriptive and appear intentionally obfuscated, which is often a sign of malicious intent or attempts to hide functionality. There is no additional logic, data handling, or network activity shown. The absence of context makes it difficult to determine the actual behavior, but the pattern of obfuscated naming and minimal code suggests potential malicious intent or at least suspicious obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears suspicious due to obfuscated naming and minimal implementation. While no direct malicious activity is evident from this snippet alone, the obfuscation raises concern about potential malicious behavior or hidden functionality in the imported module.",
