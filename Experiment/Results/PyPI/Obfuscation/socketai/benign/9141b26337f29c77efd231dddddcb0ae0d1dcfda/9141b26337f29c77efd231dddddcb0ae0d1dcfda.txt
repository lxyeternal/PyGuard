      "obfuscated": 0.6,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code in reports 1 and 3 shows suspicious features like obfuscation, dynamic execution, and hardcoded secrets, indicating potential malicious behavior with moderate to high security risk. Reports 2, 4, and 5 are benign. The current scoring is consistent with the analysis; minor adjustments could slightly increase malware and risk scores for the suspicious reports, but overall, the assessments are appropriate."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard MkDocs plugin for Swagger UI generation. It does not contain malicious or obfuscated code. The primary security consideration is the external URL fetch, which introduces a potential risk if misused, but this is inherent to the functionality and not indicative of malicious intent. The scores assigned are consistent with the analysis."
