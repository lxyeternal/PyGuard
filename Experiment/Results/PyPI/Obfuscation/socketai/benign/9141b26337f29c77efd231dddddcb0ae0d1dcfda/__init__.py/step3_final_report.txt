  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code patterns, obfuscation, data flows, and suspicious activities.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user inputs, hardcoded secrets, network domains, dynamic imports, file reads.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file writes, dynamic code execution, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources to sinks via data processing, eval/exec calls, network requests, or file operations, often involving obfuscated or hardcoded data.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variables, eval/exec usage, hardcoded credentials/secrets, suspicious domain names, complex control flows, dynamic imports, obfuscated strings.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits patterns such as dynamic execution, obfuscation, and hardcoded secrets, indicating potential malicious intent. Suspicious features are present in reports 1 and 3, with code patterns consistent with backdoors, data exfiltration, or remote code execution. Reports 2, 4, and 5 lack such patterns, indicating benign code. The scores assigned in the reports align with these observations, with higher malware and obfuscation scores justified for suspicious code. Slightly increasing malware scores for reports 1 and 3 to 0.5 and 0.7 respectively could better reflect the suspicion level, but current scores are acceptable. Overall, the assessment suggests a moderate to high security risk primarily associated with reports 1 and 3, with the rest being low risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code in reports 1 and 3 shows suspicious features like obfuscation, dynamic execution, and hardcoded secrets, indicating potential malicious behavior with moderate to high security risk. Reports 2, 4, and 5 are benign. The current scoring is consistent with the analysis; minor adjustments could slightly increase malware and risk scores for the suspicious reports, but overall, the assessments are appropriate.",
