  "purpose": "SDK wrapper for Klaviyo API with retry logic, dynamic method wrapping, and data encoding functions.",
  "sources": "Input parameters, environment variables, URL strings, and data passed to API functions.",
  "sinks": "HTTP requests made via requests.request, data assembled from parameters, encoded with base64 and JSON.",
  "flows": "Data from input sources flows into HTTP requests through encoding functions, then to external API endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function and variable names, use of base64 encoding before data transmission, dynamic method wrapping.",
  "analysis": "The code is an SDK wrapper for Klaviyo, employing obfuscation and data encoding techniques. No evidence of malicious network activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration routines. The obfuscation and encoding could be used to conceal data or internal logic but are common in SDKs for security or proprietary reasons. The low malware score (0.1) and low risk score (0.2) are consistent with the absence of malicious indicators. The obfuscation score (0.5) reflects moderate obfuscation, which is typical in SDKs but warrants caution. Overall, the code appears legitimate, with obfuscation likely for internal or security purposes rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a legitimate, obfuscated SDK wrapper for Klaviyo API, with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The obfuscation and encoding are typical for SDKs and do not indicate malicious intent. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score remains near zero. No immediate security concerns are identified based on this code.",
