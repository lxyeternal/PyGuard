  "purpose": "Import future features for compatibility and import a specific object from an external SDK module.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing a class or object from klaviyo_sdk.wrapper",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; no data processing, output, or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; only import statement present",
  "anomalies": "Imported object has a seemingly random or obfuscated name (bJbBPqHEfIeCuyKkpupbPQhTrXeCArcN), which could indicate obfuscation or malicious intent",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a future import statement and a single import of an object with an unusual name from a third-party SDK. The object name appears obfuscated or auto-generated, which could be a sign of either benign obfuscation or malicious hiding. There is no other code, no function definitions, no data processing, or network activity. The absence of logic limits the ability to detect malicious behavior, but the suspicious naming warrants further review of the imported object or module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal and primarily involves an import statement. The unusual naming of the imported object could indicate obfuscation or malicious intent, but with no further code or context, the risk is indeterminate. The code alone does not exhibit malicious behavior but warrants cautious review of the imported module.",
