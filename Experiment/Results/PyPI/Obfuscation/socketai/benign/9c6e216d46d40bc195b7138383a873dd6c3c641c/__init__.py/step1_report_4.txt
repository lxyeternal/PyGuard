  "purpose": "Importing absolute_import for compatibility and importing a specific class or function from a third-party SDK (klaviyo_sdk.wrapper).",
  "sources": "The import statement from __future__ and the import from klaviyo_sdk.wrapper",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident; the code only imports modules and classes.",
  "anomalies": "The imported identifier 'bJbBPqHEfIeCuyKkpupbPQhTrXeCArcN' appears to be a nonsensical or obfuscated name, which could suggest intentional obfuscation or hidden malicious intent. No other code or context is provided.",
  "analysis": "The code only consists of a __future__ import statement and a single import from an SDK module with an obfuscated name. There are no functions, data handling, or execution logic present. The unusual import name raises suspicion about obfuscation, which is sometimes used to conceal malicious code. However, without further context, it is impossible to definitively determine malicious intent or behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet is minimal and primarily consists of imports, with one suspiciously obfuscated identifier. The lack of further code prevents definitive conclusions, but the obfuscated import suggests potential concealment. No explicit malicious behavior or malware is observable at this stage.",
