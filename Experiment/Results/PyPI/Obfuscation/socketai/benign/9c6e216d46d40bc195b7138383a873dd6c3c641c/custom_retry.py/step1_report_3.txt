{
  "purpose": "Custom retry predicate class based on exception status, used for controlling retries in a system that handles exceptions.",
  "sources": "The class constructor receives 'statuses' as input; the exception object during retries.",
  "sinks": "The code does not have any direct sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to security effects.",
  "flows": "The predicate function checks exception attributes during exception handling, influencing retry logic.",
  "anomalies": "The class name appears obfuscated or randomly generated; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class inheriting from 'tenacity.retry_if_exception', setting up a predicate to check if an exception's 'status' attribute is within a given list of 'statuses'. The exception object is inspected dynamically, which is normal for exception handling logic. No input/output, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are evident. The naming suggests obfuscation but does not imply malicious intent. No suspicious network activity or data manipulation is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to implement a standard retry predicate based on exception statuses. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected. The obfuscated class name might suggest code hiding, but functionally, it is benign.",
