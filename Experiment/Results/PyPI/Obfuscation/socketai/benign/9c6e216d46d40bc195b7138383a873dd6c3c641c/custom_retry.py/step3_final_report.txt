  "purpose": "Defines a custom retry predicate class based on exception 'status' attribute, with obfuscated naming.",
  "sources": "Exception objects during retries, specifically their 'status' attribute.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; internal exception handling logic only.",
  "flows": "Exception raised -> predicate checks 'status' attribute -> decision to retry based on 'statuses' list.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names; no malicious code or external interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a subclass of 'tenacity.retry_if_exception' with an obfuscated name, implementing a predicate that checks if an exception has a 'status' attribute within a specified list. The logic is straightforward, with no data leaks, network activity, or malicious payloads. The obfuscation may be suspicious but does not indicate malicious intent. All reports agree on benign behavior, assigning a malware score of 0, a high obfuscation score (~0.7), and a low security risk (~0.2). The code's purpose is legitimate, focusing on exception attribute inspection for retry logic. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not justify higher risk scores. Overall, the code is benign, with obfuscation being the primary concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign implementation of a retry predicate based on exception 'status'. The obfuscated naming is suspicious but not malicious. No malicious activity or vulnerabilities are detected. The scores are appropriate and should remain as-is unless further context suggests otherwise.",
