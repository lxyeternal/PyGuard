  "purpose": "Custom retry condition class based on exception status",
  "sources": "The class accesses the exception object to check for a 'status' attribute",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks; no data is being written or transmitted outside the scope",
  "flows": "Exception object is checked for 'status' attribute, and the result is returned as a boolean",
  "anomalies": "Use of non-descriptive class and variable names; no obvious malicious behavior, but obfuscation of intent by non-standard naming",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of tenacity.retry_if_exception with a custom predicate that checks if the exception has a 'status' attribute and whether it is in a provided list of statuses. Variable and class names are non-descriptive, possibly obfuscating intent. No data leaks, network activity, or suspicious functions are present. The logic appears to be a straightforward conditional check, with no malicious actions detected. The code may be part of a larger system handling retries with custom conditions.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a custom retry predicate based on exception statuses, with no evident malicious intent. The unusual naming might suggest obfuscation, but functionally, it performs a benign check. No malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
