{
  "purpose": "Custom exception handling class extending tenacity.retry_if_exception to determine whether to retry based on exception status.",
  "sources": "Input data could come from exceptions raised during retry attempts.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks; the class modifies retry behavior based on exception properties.",
  "flows": "Exceptions raised during operations trigger the predicate, which inspects exception attributes to decide on retries.",
  "anomalies": "The class name appears obfuscated or nonsensical; no clear purpose or documentation. The inner function name is also obscure.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of tenacity.retry_if_exception, implementing a predicate that checks if an exception's 'status' attribute exists and whether it is in a provided list. The class name and inner function names are obfuscated, which may be suspicious but could also be obfuscation or placeholder. No malicious behavior such as network activity, data leakage, or backdoors is evident. The code appears to be a legitimate customization of retry logic, although the obfuscated naming raises slight suspicion. Overall, no malicious intent or malware indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a custom retry condition based on exception attributes, with no evident malicious behavior. The obfuscated naming is unusual but not malicious. Overall security risk is low.",
