      "conclusion": "The snippet is minimal and suspicious primarily because of the obfuscated object name. There is no evidence of malicious activity or data leakage, but the obfuscation warrants caution. Further investigation into the actual content of 'klaviyo_sdk.wrapper' and the purpose of 'bJbBPqHEfIeCuyKkpupbPQhTrXeCArcN' is recommended. The current scores are appropriate given the evidence."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign implementation of a retry predicate based on exception 'status'. The obfuscated naming is suspicious but not malicious. No malicious activity or vulnerabilities are detected. The scores are appropriate and should remain as-is unless further context suggests otherwise."

      "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a legitimate, obfuscated SDK wrapper for Klaviyo API, with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The obfuscation and encoding are typical for SDKs and do not indicate malicious intent. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score remains near zero. No immediate security concerns are identified based on this code."
