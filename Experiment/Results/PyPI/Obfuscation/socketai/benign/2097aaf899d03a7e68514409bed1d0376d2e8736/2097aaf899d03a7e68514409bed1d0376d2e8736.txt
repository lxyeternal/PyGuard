While obfuscation raises suspicion, there is no evidence of malicious activity such as data theft, network exfiltration, or backdoors. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score is zero. Vigilance should be maintained if external inputs influence resource URLs or HTML content without proper sanitization, but based on current analysis, the code is safe."

Scores are justified: malware = 0, obfuscation = 0.8, security risk = 0.2. No modifications are necessary; continued monitoring is advised if obfuscation is used elsewhere in the supply chain."
