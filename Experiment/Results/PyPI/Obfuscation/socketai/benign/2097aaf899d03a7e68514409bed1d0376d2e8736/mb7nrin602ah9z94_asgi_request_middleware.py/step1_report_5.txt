{
  "purpose": "This code manages request context in an ASGI application by storing Request objects in a context variable.",
  "sources": "The code reads the scope parameter in the __call__ method to create a Request object, which is then stored in a context variable.",
  "sinks": "The context variable _request_ctx_var is set with the Request object, and the get() method retrieves it. There are no other sinks or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "The scope is used to instantiate a Request object; this object is stored in the context variable, which can then be retrieved by vISCXJNJHDSaxbspzFfWYmznkYAfWITR().",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and does not contain any obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior. No external network connections or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a context variable to store the current HTTP request. The __call__ method sets this variable when an HTTP scope is encountered. The retrieval function returns the stored Request object. No malicious or suspicious code patterns are detected; the logic is consistent with standard request context management.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard implementation of request context storage for a Starlette or FastAPI application. It does not contain any malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code is clean and follows expected patterns.",
