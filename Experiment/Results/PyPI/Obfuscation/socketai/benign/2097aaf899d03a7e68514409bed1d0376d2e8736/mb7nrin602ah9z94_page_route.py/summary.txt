  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, obfuscated web UI rendering module with no malicious behavior detected. While obfuscation raises suspicion, there is no evidence of malicious activity such as data theft, network exfiltration, or backdoors. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score is zero. Vigilance should be maintained if external inputs influence resource URLs or HTML content without proper sanitization, but based on current analysis, the code is safe."
