  "purpose": "Setup of a FastAPI-based web UI framework with static resource serving, middleware, and error handling, primarily for UI overlay and static content delivery.",
  "sources": "Static resource dictionary, request body, environment variables, URL parameters.",
  "sinks": "File reads from resources, JSON encoding, HTTP responses, static file responses.",
  "flows": "Resource existence check -> file read -> response with MIME type; validation errors -> UI toast notifications -> HTML/JSON responses.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation in class and variable names, complex nested context managers, dynamic resource path handling, obfuscated import names.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily serves static files, handles validation errors with UI overlays, and sets up routing and middleware. No network activity, data exfiltration, command execution, or system modifications are observed. Obfuscation appears to be stylistic or for IP protection rather than malicious intent. The resource access is controlled with existence checks, reducing risk. The complex structure and obfuscation could be used to hide malicious behavior, but no evidence supports this.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a complex, obfuscated web UI component with no signs of malicious activity. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not currently indicate malicious intent. The overall security risk is low.",
