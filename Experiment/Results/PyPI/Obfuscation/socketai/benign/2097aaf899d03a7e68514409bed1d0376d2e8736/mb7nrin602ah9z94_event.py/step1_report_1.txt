{
  "purpose": "This code defines type hints and data structures for handling UI events and associated actions.",
  "sources": "Type annotations and imported modules; no data input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or data output points are present; the code mainly sets up types and classes.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows are explicitly described or implemented; the code defines static type structures.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are detected. The use of obfuscated variable names appears to be an attempt at obscurity but does not constitute malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of type alias definitions, optional union types, and a TypedDict class. All constructs are used for type safety and code clarity in a UI event handling context. There are no dynamic code execution, network calls, or data manipulation that could indicate malicious behavior. The obfuscated variable names do not inherently suggest malicious intent; they could be for code obfuscation or simply stylistic choices. No suspicious logic, backdoors, or malware indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup for event handling with type hints and data structures. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The use of obfuscated variable names alone is insufficient to conclude malicious intent, especially without any runtime or network activity.",
