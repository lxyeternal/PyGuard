  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structures for UI event handling, facilitating event-driven interactions in a UI framework.",
  "sources": "Conditional import for type checking, type aliases, and class attribute definitions referencing external elements and event types.",
  "sinks": "None; the code contains only static type definitions with no runtime data processing or external data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution paths; purely type annotations without dynamic data or function calls.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names and lengthy, non-descriptive identifiers; no runtime logic or data manipulation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is solely composed of type aliases, optional union types, and a TypedDict class defining UI event configurations. There are no data inputs, outputs, or runtime behaviors. Obfuscated variable names suggest minification or stylistic obfuscation but do not indicate malicious intent. No external data flows or security-sensitive operations are present. The code's static nature and lack of dynamic or network activity imply minimal security risk. The obfuscation does not elevate the security concern beyond superficial difficulty in understanding.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of type definitions for UI event handling, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. Obfuscation appears superficial and does not imply malicious intent. The malware score is zero, and the security risk is negligible.",
