{
  "purpose": "Define type aliases and a TypedDict for event handling configurations in a Python module, possibly related to UI or web event management.",
  "sources": "Type annotations and imported modules, specifically the TYPE_CHECKING import and the string literals used in type definitions.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no code executes or processes data, no input/output handling, no network or system calls.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines types and data structures.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated-like variable names (e.g., MlfYICVCRpDrNdQoOtXjetlBTaGKQNkh), and the conditional import pattern suggest an attempt to obscure code intent, but no malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of type definitions, string literal unions, and a TypedDict describing configuration options for event handling. The variables and class are used to enforce type safety. The conditional import guarded by TYPE_CHECKING is a common pattern to avoid runtime import issues. No execution, data handling, or network activity present. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are identified. The obfuscated variable names could be a red flag but may also be intentional obfuscation or naming conventions for clarity elsewhere. No malicious or malicious-sounding behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of type definitions intended for configuring event handling in a UI context. It does not contain any malicious behavior, suspicious data handling, or security risks based on the provided code. The only concern is the use of obscure variable names, but that alone does not imply malicious intent.",
