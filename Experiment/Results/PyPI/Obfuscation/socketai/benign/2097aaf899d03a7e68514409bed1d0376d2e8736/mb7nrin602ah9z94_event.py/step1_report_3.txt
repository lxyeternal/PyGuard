  "purpose": "Define type annotations and data structures for event handling and DOM manipulation in a UI framework.",
  "sources": "Import statements for TYPE_CHECKING; string literals for event types; class attributes with potentially untrusted input for functions and data.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data used in event triggers, target elements, or include/vals strings; function callbacks that may be invoked.",
  "flows": "User or external input could influence event type strings, target elements, or callback functions, which may lead to code execution or data leaks if misused.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names (e.g., MlfYICVCRpDrNdQoOtXjetlBTaGKQNkh), which may hinder understanding; extensive optional parameters that could be exploited; no explicit security checks or sanitization shown.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines types and data structures with obfuscated variable names, likely for internal use in event handling. There is no evidence of code injection, data leakage, or malicious activity. The import is conditional and for type hinting only, which is standard practice. The union and optional types allow flexible but potentially untrusted inputs. No suspicious code execution, network activity, or backdoors are apparent. The obfuscation and extensive optional parameters could be used to hide malicious logic, but in this fragment, none is explicitly present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard type annotation setup for a UI event handling framework. There is no clear malicious behavior or security risks within this snippet. The obfuscated variable names could complicate code review, but no malicious intent is evident from the provided code.",
