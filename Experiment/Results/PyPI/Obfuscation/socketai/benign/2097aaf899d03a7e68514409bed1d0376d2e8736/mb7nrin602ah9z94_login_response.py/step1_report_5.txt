  "purpose": "Define a custom FastAPI Response subclass for setting a redirect header and cookie management.",
  "sources": "The class accepts URL, headers, session_id, session_token, and expiration data as input.",
  "sinks": "The set_cookie method potentially writes session data to cookies; the header manipulation sets redirect info.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (url, headers, session_id, session_token, expires) flow into HTTP response headers and cookies.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class and method names; no clear validation or sanitization of input parameters; no apparent external data fetching.",
  "analysis": "The class is a custom Response for redirecting and setting session cookies. It assigns a redirect URL via a custom header and manages session cookies with secure attributes. No external data fetching, no code injection, or malicious network activity is evident. The code appears standard for a web response customization, with obfuscated naming, but nothing malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard FastAPI response subclass used for redirects and session management. No malicious or maliciously intended behavior is observed. The obfuscated class and method names may indicate code obfuscation but do not necessarily imply malicious intent.",
