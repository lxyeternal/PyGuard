  "purpose": "Defines a custom FastAPI Response subclass that sets a redirect header and manages session cookies.",
  "sources": "Reads 'url' parameter for redirect URL, 'KGWwQprhKcYMAUrprzgfQDlKlnUvyryb' for headers, 'session_id', 'session_token', and 'expires' parameters in method.",
  "sinks": "Sets HTTP headers and cookies with session information.",
  "flows": "Constructor sets 'Hx-Redirect' header; method 'LpqBNrxibFbInTfhxVdDMaAqVDKBkLGD' sets cookies based on session data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class and method names; no clear security issues or malicious intent observed; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of Response with obfuscated naming, which sets an HTTP redirect header and manages session cookies securely. No external data sources or untrusted input flows are evident beyond standard parameters. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or malicious data handling observed. The design appears to implement session management and redirect functionality with appropriate security flags.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to implement standard redirect and session cookie management with obfuscated identifiers. No malicious activity or supply chain security issues are detected. The code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks.",
