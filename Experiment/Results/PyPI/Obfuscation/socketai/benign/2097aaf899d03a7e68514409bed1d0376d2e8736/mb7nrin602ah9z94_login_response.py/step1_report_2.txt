  "purpose": "Define a custom FastAPI Response class that sets an HTTP header and manages cookies.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'url', 'KGWwQprhKcYMAUrprzgfQDlKlnUvyryb', 'session_id', 'session_token', 'expires'.",
  "targets": "HTTP response headers ('Hx-Redirect') and cookies via 'set_cookie' method.",
  "flows": "Initialization with 'url' and headers -> setting 'Hx-Redirect' header -> calling 'LpqBNrxibFbInTfhxVdDMaAqVDKBkLGD' to set cookies.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class and method names; no direct hardcoded secrets or credentials; no obvious malicious code or backdoors. Cookie setting appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The class extends FastAPI's Response, adding a custom header and a method to set secure cookies. The naming of the class and methods appears obfuscated but they perform standard HTTP response tasks. No data is leaked, no malicious network activity, and no suspicious behavior observed. The code appears to be a legitimate component for managing responses with cookies and headers in a web application.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard custom response class with obfuscated naming but no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It manages headers and cookies securely. No malicious behavior detected.",
