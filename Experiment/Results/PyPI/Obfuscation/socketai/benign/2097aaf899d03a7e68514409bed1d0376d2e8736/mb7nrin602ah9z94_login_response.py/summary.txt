  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, implementing standard redirect and session cookie handling with obfuscation that does not imply malicious intent. Scores are justified: malware = 0, obfuscation = 0.8, security risk = 0.2. No modifications are necessary; continued monitoring is advised if obfuscation is used elsewhere in the supply chain."
