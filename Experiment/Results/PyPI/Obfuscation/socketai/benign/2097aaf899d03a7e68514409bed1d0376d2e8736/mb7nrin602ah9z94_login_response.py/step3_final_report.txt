  "purpose": "Custom FastAPI Response subclass for redirect and secure cookie management",
  "sources": "Input parameters: url, session_id, session_token, expires; headers: 'Hx-Redirect'; cookies: session info",
  "sinks": "Setting headers and cookies with security flags; no external data or untrusted sinks observed",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into headers ('Hx-Redirect') and cookies (session_id, session_token, expires)",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names; no hardcoded secrets; no validation of input parameters",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of Response that manages redirection via a custom header and sets secure, HttpOnly cookies for session management. The obfuscation of class and method names is superficial and does not imply malicious intent. No suspicious data flows, external calls, or malicious payloads are present. The security flags on cookies are appropriate, and no vulnerabilities are evident. The obfuscation score is high due to naming, but this does not indicate malicious behavior. The malware score remains at zero, consistent with the benign analysis. The overall security risk is low (~0.2), reflecting standard practices and the absence of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, implementing standard redirect and session cookie handling with obfuscation that does not imply malicious intent. Scores are justified: malware = 0, obfuscation = 0.8, security risk = 0.2. No modifications are necessary; continued monitoring is advised if obfuscation is used elsewhere in the supply chain.",
