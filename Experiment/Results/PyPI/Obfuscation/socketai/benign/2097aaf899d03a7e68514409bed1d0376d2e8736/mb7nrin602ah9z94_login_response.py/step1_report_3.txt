  "sources": "Input parameters: url, session_id, session_token, expires.",
  "sinks": "Setting cookie with session information, modifying response headers.",
  "flows": "Constructor sets redirect URL in header; method sets secure session cookie with session ID and token.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code patterns, no obfuscated code, straightforward use of FastAPI Response.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of FastAPI's Response to manage HTTP redirect headers and set secure cookies. The constructor initializes response headers with a redirect URL. The method 'LpqBNrxibFbInTfhxVdDMaAqVDKBkLGD' sets a secure, HttpOnly cookie with session data, which is standard for session management. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The code adheres to typical web response patterns, with no suspicious data flows or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate custom response class used for redirecting and managing session cookies. No malicious behavior or security issues are evident.",
