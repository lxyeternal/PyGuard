{
  "purpose": "Importing modules and functions from the 'uiwiz' package, defining an exported API including version information.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules and specific functions or classes from the 'uiwiz' package.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no untrusted data handling, network communication, or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only performs static imports and an __all__ declaration.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual aspect is the obfuscated-looking import names such as 'vtOptAuFtDklmdpNPGgdqUbNQkPBIhkU' and 'zeTctIfzfwQYZJhFVYcjCgPjHTUwEKgZ', which resemble obfuscated identifiers rather than meaningful names.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of import statements that import modules and functions with intentionally obfuscated names from the 'uiwiz' package, followed by an __all__ declaration exposing certain identifiers. The obfuscated identifiers could be an attempt to hide the true purpose or contents of these imports, which is suspicious. However, the code itself does not perform any runtime behavior such as network activity, file access, or data processing. The purpose appears to be to expose certain components under a controlled API, but the obfuscation raises suspicion of possible concealment or malicious intent.\n\nThere are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or system manipulation within this snippet. The only concern is the use of obfuscated identifiers, which could be for concealment or evasion of static analysis, not necessarily malicious in themselves but warranting caution.\n\nOverall, this code does not contain malware or security risks outright but uses obfuscation that could hide malicious behavior elsewhere.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs static imports with obfuscated names, which could be a sign of concealment. There is no direct malicious activity visible in this snippet, but the obfuscation raises suspicion about the intent. Overall, the risk appears low based on this limited fragment, but the obfuscation warrants further review of the full package.",
