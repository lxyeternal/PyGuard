{
  "purpose": "This code imports modules and classes from the 'uiwiz' package, defining the public API with __all__.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'uiwiz' modules, notably with obfuscated or nonsensical class and module names.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows are present; the code only imports components without executing or transmitting data.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows; static import statements do not establish source-to-sink data paths.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated, nonsensical identifiers for modules and classes, which could be an attempt to conceal malicious code or functionality.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with obfuscated names, which is suspicious but not inherently malicious. No active malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code execution, is evident. The obfuscation raises concern about potential concealment of malicious code elsewhere in the package. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.2, obfuscation ~0.7, security risk ~0.2-0.3) are consistent with this assessment. Further review of the full package source is recommended to verify the nature of these components.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign in isolation but employs obfuscated identifiers that warrant further investigation. No direct evidence of malicious activity is present, but the obfuscation justifies cautious monitoring. The scores are appropriate given the context.",
