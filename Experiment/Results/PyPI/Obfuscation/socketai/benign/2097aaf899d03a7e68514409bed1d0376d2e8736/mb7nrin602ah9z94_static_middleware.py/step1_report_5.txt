  "purpose": "Middleware for caching static resources by setting Cache-Control headers based on URL path.",
  "sources": "Request URL path within the scope, specifically checking for 'static/' in the URL.",
  "sinks": "MutableHeaders object where Cache-Control header is set; send function to forward messages.",
  "flows": "Request URL -> condition check for 'static/' -> mutable headers modification -> message sent downstream.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated class and function names, but no malicious code observed. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an ASGI middleware that intercepts HTTP responses. It inspects the request URL, and if it contains 'static/', it sets the Cache-Control header with a max-age value provided during initialization. The code uses obfuscated class and variable names but performs straightforward header modification without executing any dynamic code, network connections, or data exfiltration. No signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior are evident. The code appears to be benign middleware for cache control.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a non-malicious middleware component intended to add caching headers for static assets. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
