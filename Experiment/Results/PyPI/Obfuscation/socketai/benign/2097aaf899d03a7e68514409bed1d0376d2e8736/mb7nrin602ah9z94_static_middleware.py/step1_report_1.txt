{
  "purpose": "This code defines an ASGI middleware for a Starlette application that modifies response headers based on request URL patterns.",
  "sources": "The request object (Request(scope)) is created from the scope to read URL information; the message parameter in the inner function receives response start messages.",
  "sinks": "Modification of response headers via MutableHeaders to set Cache-Control; potential for untrusted input affecting headers if URL info is manipulated.",
  "flows": "Request URL is read from the scope via Request object; if URL contains 'static/', headers are modified in the response start message before sending.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class and function names; no hardcoded secrets or obvious malicious code; no external network or file access; no suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is an asynchronous middleware class that intercepts HTTP responses. It checks if the request URL contains 'static/' and, if so, sets a Cache-Control header with a max-age value. The code does not process untrusted input directly but depends on the request URL, which could be manipulated by an attacker to influence cache headers. No code injection, data leaks, or external communications are present. The obfuscated naming is suspicious but not malicious per se. Overall, the logic is benign and typical for performance optimization or cache control.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward middleware implementation to control caching headers for static assets. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. The obfuscated names could be a concern but do not imply malicious behavior. Overall, the code is benign.",
