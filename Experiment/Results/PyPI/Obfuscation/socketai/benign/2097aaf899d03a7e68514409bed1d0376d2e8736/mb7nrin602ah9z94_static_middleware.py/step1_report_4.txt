  "purpose": "Middleware for setting cache control headers on HTTP responses for static files.",
  "sources": "Request URL parsing from starlette.requests.Request, scope data in async call, message data in the response start event.",
  "sinks": "MutableHeaders scope in the response to modify 'Cache-Control' header.",
  "flows": "Request URL is checked; if it contains 'static/', headers are modified before response is sent.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class and function names, but no malicious or suspicious logic is present; no hardcoded secrets or unusual code behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an ASGI middleware class that intercepts HTTP responses. It inspects the request URL; if it contains 'static/', it adds a Cache-Control header with a configurable max-age. The variable naming is obfuscated, but the logic is straightforward and typical for cache control middleware. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code performs expected header modifications based on request URL content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard middleware component intended for cache control optimization. It does not contain malicious code or security risks. The obfuscated class and function names are unusual but not harmful. Overall, this appears to be a benign implementation with no malicious intent.",
