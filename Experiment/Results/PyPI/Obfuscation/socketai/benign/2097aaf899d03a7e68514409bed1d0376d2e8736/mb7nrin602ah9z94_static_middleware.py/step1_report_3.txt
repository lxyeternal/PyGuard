{
  "purpose": "A middleware component for a Starlette-based web application that modifies HTTP response headers to include cache control directives for static content.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the incoming request via 'Request(scope)', and inspects the URL to determine if static content is being requested.",
  "sinks": "Modifies the response headers via 'MutableHeaders' to set cache control; sends the response back to the client.",
  "flows": "Request is received -> URL checked for 'static/' -> If matched, response headers are modified to include cache control -> Response is sent back to client.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class and variable names; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no unusual or malicious code constructs; no network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a middleware that intercepts HTTP responses in a Starlette application. It examines the request URL for the substring 'static/' and, if present, adds a 'Cache-Control' header with a max-age value specified at initialization. The obfuscated class and variable names may suggest attempts at hiding intent but do not in themselves indicate malicious activity. No external network activity, data leakage, or malicious payloads are present. The code performs a straightforward header modification based on request URL patterns, which is a common and benign operation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign middleware component designed to optimize caching for static content. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within this code snippet.",
