  "purpose": "Middleware to modify response headers for static assets by setting Cache-Control based on URL pattern.",
  "sources": "Request URL string from scope, specifically checking for 'static/' substring.",
  "sinks": "Response headers where 'Cache-Control' is set, affecting client caching behavior.",
  "flows": "Request URL is inspected; if it contains 'static/', response headers are modified before sending.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names; no malicious code or external network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a straightforward cache-control middleware that inspects the request URL for 'static/' and sets the 'Cache-Control' header accordingly. No external calls, data leaks, or code injections are present. Obfuscated naming raises suspicion but does not indicate malicious intent. The logic is standard and benign, with low security risk. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0 and low risk scores (~0.2). Obfuscation scores vary but are justified given the naming. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign cache-control middleware with obfuscated naming. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or vulnerabilities. The obfuscation is suspicious but not malicious. Overall, the code is low risk and safe to use.",
