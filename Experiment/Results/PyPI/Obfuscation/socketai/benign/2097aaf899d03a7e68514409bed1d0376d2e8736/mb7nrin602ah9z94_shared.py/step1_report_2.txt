{
  "purpose": "This code manages resources and page mappings using hashing of function source code, presumably for resource tracking or dynamic page handling.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include function objects and resource paths added via functions; no external data input like user input or network data is explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "Stored in dictionaries (resources and page_map); no direct data leaks or external data outputs are evident.",
  "flows": "Functions hash source code to generate keys, store resource paths or page identifiers, and retrieve page identifiers based on hashed function source code.",
  "anomalies": "The use of obfuscated variable names and dynamic hashing of function source code for mapping purposes is unusual. No hardcoded credentials or obvious malicious code present. No code injection, data leakage, or unsafe operations identified.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a caching function that hashes the source code of provided functions, storing the hash. Functions allow mapping resource paths and page identifiers to these hashes, and retrieval based on the hash. Clearing functions reset stored mappings. The obfuscated variable names obscure intent but do not indicate malicious behavior. No network activity, system modification, or malicious data handling detected. The code appears to implement a resource-page tracking mechanism without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is designed for resource and page mapping using function source hashing. No evidence of malicious activity or security risks found. The obfuscation appears to be for code hiding or compression, not malicious purposes.",
