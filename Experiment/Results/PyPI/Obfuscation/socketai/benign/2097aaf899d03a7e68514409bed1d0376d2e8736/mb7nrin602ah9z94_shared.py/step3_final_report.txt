{
  "purpose": "The code manages resources and page mappings by generating hashes from function source code and function names, storing associated data in global dictionaries for resource paths and page identifiers.",
  "sources": "The code reads function source code via inspect.getsource() and function names for hashing; it also accesses resource paths and function objects.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data leaks are present; the code does not perform network communication, file writing beyond resource paths, or credential handling.",
  "flows": "Function source code and names are used as sources; their hashes serve as keys to store and retrieve resource paths and page identifiers in global dictionaries; no external data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "Use of opaque variable names, reliance on source code hashing for mapping, and absence of input validation are unusual but not inherently malicious; potential hash collision or manipulation risk exists but is not evidenced.",
  "analysis": "The code employs source code hashing to uniquely identify functions for resource and page mapping, which is unconventional but not malicious. No signs of code injection, network activity, or data exfiltration are present. The obfuscation through variable names and hashing is superficial and likely for internal identification. The lack of input validation is a concern but does not constitute malicious behavior. The consistent absence of malicious activity across reports supports the benign interpretation. The primary risk is the obfuscation and reliance on source code hashing, which could be manipulated if source code is altered, but no such activity is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a resource and page mapping utility using source hashing, with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious intent or activity. The security risk is low, and malware likelihood is negligible. The obfuscation is moderate but not malicious.",
