{
  "purpose": "Define literal types for HTML element names and attributes, likely used for type safety or validation in HTML generation or processing.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; code is defining constants and type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; static definitions only.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic. The code appears to be a straightforward set of constant lists and type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static data definitions: lists of HTML tags and attributes, annotated with Python Literal types. There are no functions, data processing, user input handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution. No indicators of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are present. The code’s structure and content are typical for type hinting or validation schemas related to HTML content handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and serves as static type annotations for HTML tags and attributes. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
