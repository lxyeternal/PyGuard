  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as static definitions of HTML tags and attributes, primarily for type annotations or validation.\n- No external input, data processing, or dynamic behavior is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious constructs are detected.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the static, benign nature of the code.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which seems appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and potential issues:\n- The code does **not** process any untrusted data, nor does it perform any I/O or network operations.\n- The string literals are standard HTML tags and attributes, with no indication of malicious content.\n- The code is purely static and serves as type hints or constants.\n\n### Error or flaw in the report's logic:\n- **No significant errors** detected in the reasoning of the reports.\n- The reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code and do not overstate risks.\n\n### Scores and their reasonableness:\n- **Malware score:** consistently 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk:** 0, which aligns with the static, benign nature.\n- **Confidence:** 1 or close, which is justified.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- Since all reports assign a malware score of 0 and describe the code as static, there is no basis for higher risk scores.\n- The code does not perform any suspicious or malicious activity.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- No issues with the claims; all are accurate.\n- The code appears to be used for validation, documentation, or tooling, which is safe.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\nGiven the analysis, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is benign, static, and safe.\n\n**Final scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code poses no security threat.",
