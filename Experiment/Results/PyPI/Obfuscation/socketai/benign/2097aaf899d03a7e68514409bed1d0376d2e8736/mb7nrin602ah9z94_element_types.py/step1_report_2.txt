  "purpose": "Define Python type literals for HTML element tags and attributes.",
  "sources": "Static string lists assigned to variables.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The code appears to be static definitions of string literals.",
  "analysis": "The code contains static lists of HTML tag names and attributes assigned to variables with type hints. There are no functions, data processing, user input handling, network operations, or any dynamic execution. All elements are predefined string literals used perhaps for validation or auto-completion. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious patterns are evident. No evidence of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The code is purely static type annotation definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This code consists solely of static data definitions for HTML tags and attributes with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be used for validation, tooling, or documentation purposes. No threats or malicious behavior detected.",
