  "purpose": "Static definitions of HTML tags and attributes for validation, tooling, or documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "String literals assigned to variables, used in type annotations for HTML elements and attributes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static data used solely for type hints or constants.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static data remains unchanged and unused in runtime logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists solely of static string lists and type annotations, with no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely static, defining lists of HTML tags and attributes, and creating Literal type aliases. There are no functions, data processing, external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. All reports correctly identify the static, benign nature of the code, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is appropriately 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0 across all assessments. The confidence levels are justified given the straightforward, static content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static set of HTML tag and attribute definitions, serving as type annotations or constants. There is no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security concern. All reports are accurate and consistent; no revisions are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
