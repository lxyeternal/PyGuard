  "purpose": "Define string literal types for HTML tags and attributes, possibly for use in type checking or validation.",
  "sources": "String assignments and type alias definitions using Python's Literal from the typing module.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or executed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only declares data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns detected. The code appears to be a static set of type aliases and string lists.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Literal from typing and defines two lists of strings representing HTML tags and attributes. It also creates type aliases for specific subsets of these strings. No input handling, data processing, or external interactions are present. The code appears to serve as a type or validation schema for HTML elements. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or obfuscation. The code is purely declarative with no executable logic or data flows that could be exploited.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a static declaration of HTML tag and attribute names using Python's typing system. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It is likely intended for type validation or auto-completion purposes.",
