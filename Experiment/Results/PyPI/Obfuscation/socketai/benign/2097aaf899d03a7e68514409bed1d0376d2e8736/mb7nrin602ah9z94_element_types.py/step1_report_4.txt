{
  "purpose": "Define string literal types related to HTML tags and attributes for use in type annotations or validation.",
  "sources": "None; all data are static string lists and type literals.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; code only declares constants and type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward type annotation definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'Literal' from 'typing' and defines several lists of HTML tag and attribute names, assigning them to variables. These are static data structures with no data processing, input/output handling, or runtime behavior. No user input, external data, or dynamic code execution is present. The code appears solely as type definitions for code validation or documentation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of type annotations and static data definitions related to HTML tags and attributes. There is no malicious behavior, no data flow, and no suspicious activity. It serves as a utility for type checking or documentation.",
