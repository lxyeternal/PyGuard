  "purpose": "Define string literals for HTML tag names and size options, likely for use in HTML rendering or validation.",
  "sources": "The code reads string literals from predefined lists, no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data processing or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only defines constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. The code consists solely of static variable assignments with string literals.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple lists and Literal types containing HTML tag names and size options. There is no user input handling, data processing, or external interactions. The content appears to serve as static configuration or constants, with no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of constant definitions for HTML tags and size options. No malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks detected.",
