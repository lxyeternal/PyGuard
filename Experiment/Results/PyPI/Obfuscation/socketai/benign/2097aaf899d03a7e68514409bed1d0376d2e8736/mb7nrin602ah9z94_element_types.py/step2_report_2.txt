  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code content with the claims, and evaluating the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code is purely static, defining lists of HTML tags and attributes, and creating Literal type aliases for them.\n- No functions, no data processing, no user input, no external data sources, no network activity.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or dynamic behavior.\n- The code's purpose appears to be for validation, type hinting, or documentation.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Summary:** The code defines string literals for HTML tags and size options, with no external input or data flow. It concludes benign with no security risks.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The code is static, safe, and non-malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. **No change needed.**\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing static definitions for HTML tags and attributes, with no data flow or malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is static and benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. **No change needed.**\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Summary:** Again, static data definitions for HTML tags and attributes, with no suspicious patterns or malicious intent.\n- **Assessment:** Valid. No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. **No change needed.**\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Summary:** Same as above, static type annotations and string lists, no data flow or malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. **No change needed.**\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Summary:** Static declarations for HTML tags and attributes, intended for validation or type checking, with no malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. **No change needed.**\n\n---\n\n### Final thoughts:\n- All reports consistently identify the code as static, benign, with no malicious or obfuscated content.\n- The malware score is correctly assigned as 0 across all reports.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, which is appropriate.\n- The security risk is correctly identified as 0, given the nature of the code.\n\n**However, considering the purpose of the code:**\n\n- It’s a set of static type annotations and constant definitions, which are harmless.\n- No evidence of malicious intent, data leakage, or obfuscation.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nAll reports are accurate in their assessments. The code is benign, static, and serves as a type annotation utility for HTML tags and attributes. No changes to scores or conclusions are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nGiven the static nature and purpose, the code poses no security threat. The scores and analysis are consistent and justified.",
