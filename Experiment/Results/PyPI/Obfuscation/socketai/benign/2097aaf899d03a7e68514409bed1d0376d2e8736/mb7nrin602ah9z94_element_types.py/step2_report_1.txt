  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is static, consisting solely of string literals and type annotations for HTML tags and attributes.\n- No user input, external data, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or backdoors.\n- The purpose appears to be for validation, tooling, or documentation.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n---\n\n### Report 1:\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is benign, static definitions.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — justified.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2:\n- **Assessment:** Correct. Static string lists with no dynamic behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — justified.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3:\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious behavior, purely static data.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — justified.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4:\n- **Assessment:** Correct. Static type annotations and data.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — justified.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5:\n- **Assessment:** Correct. Static declarations with no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — justified.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — still reasonable given the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- **Code content:** Pure static definitions of HTML tags and attributes, no dynamic or external behavior.\n- **Malware risk:** None detected; scores of 0 are appropriate.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected; scores of 0 are justified.\n- **Security risk:** None; scores of 0 are justified.\n- **Confidence levels:** All are appropriate, with minor variation.\n\n### Final assessment:\nBased on the detailed review, **the scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature**. There is no evidence to suggest any malicious intent or security vulnerability.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign, static set of type annotations and string literals for HTML tags and attributes, with no security concerns.",
