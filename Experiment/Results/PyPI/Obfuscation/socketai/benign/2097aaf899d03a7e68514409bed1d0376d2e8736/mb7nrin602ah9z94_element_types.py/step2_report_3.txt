  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the accuracy of their conclusions, the correctness of the code, and the appropriateness of the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code consists solely of static lists of HTML tags and attributes, assigned to variables and used in Python Literal type annotations.\n- There are no functions, no data processing, no external input/output, no network activity, and no dynamic code.\n- All reports agree that the code is static, benign, and intended for validation, documentation, or tooling purposes.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are evident.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose:** Defines string literals for HTML tags and sizes.\n- **Findings:** Static lists, no external data, no sinks, no anomalies.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe conclusion is correct. The code is straightforward, static, and safe. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose:** Define Python type literals for HTML elements and attributes.\n- **Findings:** Static data, no data flow, no anomalies.\n- **Conclusion:** Static definitions for validation or tooling, benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, accurate. No malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar to above, for type safety or validation.\n- **Findings:** Static data, no data flow, no anomalies.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, static type annotations.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nCorrect. The code is purely static. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose:** Define string literal types for HTML tags and attributes.\n- **Findings:** Static data, no data processing, no input/output.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, for validation or documentation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAccurate. No malicious intent or obfuscation. Scores are suitable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, for type checking or validation.\n- **Findings:** String assignments, no data flow, no anomalies.\n- **Conclusion:** Static declaration, benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with the other reports. Slightly less than perfect confidence, but still reasonable given the static nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Analysis:**\n\n- **Presence of issues in code:**  \n  The code is purely static, defining constants and type annotations. No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious code are present.\n\n- **Errors or flaws in reports:**  \n  All reports correctly identify the static, benign nature of the code. No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  The malware scores are all zero, which is appropriate. Risk scores are zero, as there's no security concern. Obfuscated is zero, as the code isn't obfuscated.\n\n- **Justification for higher risk scores:**  \n  Since no malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are detected, higher scores would be unjustified.\n\n- **Consistency:**  \n  All reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**Estimated scores based on analysis:**  \n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is benign static data definitions with no security implications. No changes to scores or conclusions are necessary.",
