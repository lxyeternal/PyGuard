  "purpose": "Retrieve the version of the 'feco3' package using importlib.metadata if available, or fallback to importlib_metadata.",
  "sources": "Import statements and the 'version' function from importlib.metadata or importlib_metadata",
  "sinks": "Return statement providing package version information; no direct data leak or untrusted sink present",
  "flows": "Importing 'version' function, then returning version of 'feco3' package",
  "anomalies": "Function name appears obfuscated or intentionally nonsensical; no clear purpose from the name, but no malicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import the 'version' function from 'importlib.metadata', or fallback to 'importlib_metadata'. It then returns the version of the 'feco3' package. There are no external inputs, no network connections, and no suspicious data handling. The obfuscated function name does not imply malicious intent, but could suggest concealment. The core logic is straightforward and limited to version retrieval. No signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code simply retrieves and returns the version of a specific package. There are no malicious behaviors or security issues identified. The unusual function name might be intended to obfuscate, but the code itself is benign.",
