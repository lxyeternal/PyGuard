  "purpose": "Retrieve the version of the 'feco3' package using standard Python import mechanisms for compatibility.",
  "sources": "The import statements for 'version' from 'importlib.metadata' or 'importlib_metadata'.",
  "sinks": "Return statement calling 'version(\"feco3\")', which outputs package version info.",
  "flows": "Import 'version' -> call 'version(\"feco3\")' -> output version string.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function name; no external inputs, network activity, or data manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility to obtain package version info, using standard import fallback for compatibility. The function name appears obfuscated, which could be suspicious but does not imply malicious intent. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or network activity are present. The obfuscation is the only red flag, but it is a common tactic and not inherently malicious. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: around 0.6-0.7, risk: very low) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The code performs a simple, safe operation with no signs of sabotage or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely to retrieve a package version. The obfuscated function name is suspicious but not evidence of malicious intent. The overall security risk is minimal, and the malware score should remain at 0. The obfuscation score can be justified at around 0.6-0.7 due to the function name. No further action is necessary beyond noting the obfuscation as a cautionary point.",
