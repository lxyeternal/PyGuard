{
  "purpose": "Retrieve the version number of the package named 'feco3'.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'version' from 'importlib.metadata' or 'importlib_metadata', and calls 'version' with the package name 'feco3'.",
  "sinks": "The 'version' function call is a benign operation that retrieves package metadata; no untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The code imports 'version' and then calls 'version(\"feco3\")' to obtain the package version; no data flows from external sources into the code.",
  "anomalies": "The function name appears obfuscated or randomly generated, which can be suspicious. No other unusual code behavior or hardcoded secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The function is a simple utility to obtain the version number of a specific package 'feco3'. It includes a fallback import for compatibility. The code does not accept external input, modify data, or perform network operations. The obfuscated function name may suggest an attempt to conceal purpose but does not itself imply malicious intent. No suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration or malicious actions are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility function for retrieving package version info. The obfuscated function name could be a red flag, but there is no evidence of malicious behavior. It appears safe.",
