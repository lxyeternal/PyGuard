  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely to retrieve a package version. The obfuscated function name is suspicious but not evidence of malicious intent. The overall security risk is minimal, and the malware score should remain at 0. The obfuscation score can be justified at around 0.6-0.7 due to the function name. No further action is necessary beyond noting the obfuscation as a cautionary point."
