  "anomalies": "Unusual variable name with a seemingly random string; no other code present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a variable assignment with a seemingly random variable name and a version string. There are no inputs, outputs, or additional logic. No external calls, data handling, or obfuscated code observed. The variable name does not suggest malicious intent or obfuscation, just an arbitrary string.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, merely assigning a version string to a variable with an unusual name. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
