  "purpose": "Assignment of a version string to a variable, likely indicating package version.",
  "sources": "No data input or external sources read by this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flows; simple variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable name: 'UhmmjcSWAuEesipDFfcMWKlXfxFAxMlL' is non-descriptive and complex; no apparent purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a variable assignment with a hardcoded string value representing a version number. There are no functions, data input/output, or executable logic. The variable name appears obfuscated or randomly generated, which could be suspicious but may also be harmless. No malicious activity, data leaks, or security issues are evident in this single line.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign variable assignment indicating a version number. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
