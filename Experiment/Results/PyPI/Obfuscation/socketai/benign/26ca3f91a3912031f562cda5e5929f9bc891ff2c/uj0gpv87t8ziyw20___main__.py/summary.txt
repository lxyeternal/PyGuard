  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate CLI setup with heavy obfuscation. There is no direct evidence of malicious activity or supply chain sabotage. The suspicion due to obfuscation is justified but not confirmed. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score should remain at 0.0. The obfuscation score is high (~0.7), reflecting suspicion, and the risk score is moderate (~0.3). Further review of imported modules and build_cli implementation is recommended for comprehensive assurance."
