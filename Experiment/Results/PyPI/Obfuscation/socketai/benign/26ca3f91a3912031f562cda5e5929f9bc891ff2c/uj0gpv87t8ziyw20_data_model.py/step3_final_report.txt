{
  "purpose": "Static configuration data for Gillespy2 solvers, defining solver types, parameters, and mappings without dynamic input or external communication.",
  "sources": "No external input; all data is hardcoded within class definitions, enums, and dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows to external systems, files, or networks.",
  "flows": "Static data assignment within the code; no runtime data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of class and variable names, which appear auto-generated or intentionally obscured.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static configuration objects, enums, and mappings for solver parameters. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or system modifications are present. The obfuscation is suspicious but not indicative of malicious intent. The high obfuscation score reflects the obscured identifiers, but the lack of active malicious logic or data exfiltration suggests benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static, obfuscated configuration module for Gillespy2 solvers with no evidence of malicious behavior. The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not constitute malicious activity. The malware score remains at 0, and the security risk is low (~0.2).",
