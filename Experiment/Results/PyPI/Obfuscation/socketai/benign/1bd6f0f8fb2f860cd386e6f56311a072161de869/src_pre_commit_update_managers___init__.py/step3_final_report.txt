  "purpose": "Import obfuscated variables/functions from local modules and expose class names for public API.",
  "sources": "Local modules (.env, .message, .option, .repo, .yaml) from which variables are imported.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static import statements only.",
  "flows": "Import statements load variables into the namespace; no data flow or external interaction occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated variable names for imported entities; no other suspicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static imports from local modules with obfuscated variable names, which could be auto-generated or for concealment. There is no network activity, data handling, or dynamic code execution. The obfuscation alone does not imply malicious intent. The malware score is appropriately set to 0, indicating no malicious behavior. The obfuscation score is moderate to high, reflecting the variable naming, but this is not inherently malicious. The security risk score is low, consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious actions. The code is syntactically correct and straightforward, with no signs of sabotage or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign, involving static imports with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are justified and consistent with the analysis. No modifications are necessary.",
