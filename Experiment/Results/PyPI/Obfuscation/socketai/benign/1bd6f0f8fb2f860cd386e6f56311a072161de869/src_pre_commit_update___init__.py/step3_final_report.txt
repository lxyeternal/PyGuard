  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Use of 'exec', 'eval', network activity, obfuscated data, hardcoded secrets, suspicious strings, dynamic code execution, external communications.",
  "sinks": "Potential data exfiltration points, network connections, file modifications, environment variable access, dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input or obfuscated data flow into dynamic execution or network transmission sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'exec'/'eval' on untrusted data, high obfuscation, suspicious network activity, hardcoded credentials, unusual code constructs, lack of code in some reports.",
  "analysis": "The reports indicate that suspicious behaviors like dynamic code execution, obfuscation, and network activity are strong indicators of malicious intent. Benign reports lack such patterns. Scores assigned are consistent with these observations. High malware and obfuscation scores are justified where such patterns are present. The absence of code or benign code justifies low scores. Confidence levels are high where indicators are clear, moderate where patterns are suspicious but not confirmed. Overall, the scoring aligns well with the described behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The reports' scores are generally accurate and consistent with their analyses. High suspicion reports (2 and 5) appropriately have elevated malware and obfuscation scores. Benign or no-code reports (1, 3, 4) have minimal or zero scores. No adjustments are necessary; further dynamic analysis could confirm suspicions where patterns are ambiguous.",
