  "conclusion": "The reports' scores are generally accurate and consistent with their analyses. High suspicion reports (2 and 5) appropriately have elevated malware and obfuscation scores. Benign or no-code reports (1, 3, 4) have minimal or zero scores. No adjustments are necessary; further dynamic analysis could confirm suspicions where patterns are ambiguous."
