  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be a generic Python script possibly intended for data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from local variables, possibly from external input such as files or environment variables (if present), but no explicit input sources are evident in the visible code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, network requests, or file operations if present elsewhere, but none are explicitly shown in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "No clear source-to-sink data flow is observable due to the lack of input and output operations in the provided code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are evident. The code uses standard Python features without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code appears straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent. It does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration. There are no indications of code injection, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The structure and content seem benign and typical for utility or processing scripts.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a standard, benign Python script with no hidden malicious intent.",
