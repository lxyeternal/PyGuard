      "security_risk": 0.2,
      "obfuscated": 0.8,
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code functions as a legitimate version management utility with obfuscated identifiers. No evidence of malware, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities is detected. The obfuscation likely aims to conceal purpose but does not imply malicious activity. The security risk and malware scores are justified as low, while the obfuscation score is high due to naming. Overall, the code is benign and suitable for use in version handling scenarios."

      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate but heavily obfuscated dependency management CLI utility. There is no direct evidence of malicious activity within this snippet, but the obfuscation warrants caution. External modules and runtime behavior should be further analyzed to confirm safety. The malware score is set at 0.2, obfuscation at 0.8, and overall risk at 0.3 to reflect the cautious stance."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The reports' scores are generally accurate and consistent with their analyses. High suspicion reports (2 and 5) appropriately have elevated malware and obfuscation scores. Benign or no-code reports (1, 3, 4) have minimal or zero scores. No adjustments are necessary; further dynamic analysis could confirm suspicions where patterns are ambiguous."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily utility functions with superficial obfuscation. No evidence of malware or malicious payloads. The main security consideration is the potential for command injection via unvalidated URLs in git commands, which warrants cautious use but does not constitute active malicious behavior."

      "conclusion": "The code is a complex, obfuscated repository management system with external dependencies that could conceal malicious activity. Static analysis shows no explicit malicious behavior, but obfuscation and reliance on external functions justify cautious monitoring. The assigned scores (malware ~0.3, obfuscated ~0.75, risk ~0.35) are justified given the current evidence."

The obfuscation warrants caution, and further investigation of the external function NIChyjZCYgiMATAgnygvnnsqFbhbOiOi is recommended. Overall, the threat level is low, but continued monitoring is advised."

The obfuscation and external styling function should be reviewed to confirm safety, but current analysis indicates low risk."

It does not perform network communication, data exfiltration, or destructive actions. The obfuscation raises suspicion but is not sufficient to classify it as malware. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score should remain at 0."
