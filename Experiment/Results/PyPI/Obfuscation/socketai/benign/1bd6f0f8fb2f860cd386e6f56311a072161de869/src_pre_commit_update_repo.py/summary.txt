  "conclusion": "The code functions as a legitimate version management utility with obfuscated identifiers. No evidence of malware, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities is detected. The obfuscation likely aims to conceal purpose but does not imply malicious activity. The security risk and malware scores are justified as low, while the obfuscation score is high due to naming. Overall, the code is benign and suitable for use in version handling scenarios."
