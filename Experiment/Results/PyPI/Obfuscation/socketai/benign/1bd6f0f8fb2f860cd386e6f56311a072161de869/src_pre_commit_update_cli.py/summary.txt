  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate but heavily obfuscated dependency management CLI utility. There is no direct evidence of malicious activity within this snippet, but the obfuscation warrants caution. External modules and runtime behavior should be further analyzed to confirm safety. The malware score is set at 0.2, obfuscation at 0.8, and overall risk at 0.3 to reflect the cautious stance."
