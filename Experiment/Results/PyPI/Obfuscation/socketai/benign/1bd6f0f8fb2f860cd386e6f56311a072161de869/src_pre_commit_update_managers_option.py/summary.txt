  "conclusion": "The code is a configuration management utility with obfuscated naming but no evidence of malicious behavior. It does not perform network communication, data exfiltration, or destructive actions. The obfuscation raises suspicion but is not sufficient to classify it as malware. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score should remain at 0."
