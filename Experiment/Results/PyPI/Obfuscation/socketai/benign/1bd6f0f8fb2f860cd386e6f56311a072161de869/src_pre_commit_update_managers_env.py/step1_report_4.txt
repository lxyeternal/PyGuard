  "purpose": "Manage environment variables related to Git prompt and Python encoding settings, allowing for temporary modification and restoration.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT, PYTHONIOENCODING, PYTHONUTF8 during initialization.",
  "sinks": "Modifying environment variables GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT, PYTHONIOENCODING, PYTHONUTF8 in static and instance methods.",
  "flows": "Initialization reads environment variables -> zpupbstngnkUwFUEIuiyPZQifGQgQxLB() modifies environment variables -> pAEPVRXNxFHLuwsUeAjCrfoMmxFIFfPE() restores original environment variables.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no malicious or suspicious code patterns, no obfuscated code, and no external network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code reads environment variables during object initialization to store their values. It provides a static method to set environment variables to specific values, likely for controlling behavior during execution. It also provides a method to restore the environment variables to their original states. The code operates solely on environment variables, with no network activity, file manipulation, or data exfiltration. There are no indicators of malicious intent or sabotage, such as data theft, backdoors, or stealthy behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for managing environment variables, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any harmful actions, and its purpose is likely related to controlling or resetting environment configurations during runtime.",
