  "purpose": "Manage environment variables related to Git terminal prompt and Python encoding settings",
  "sources": "os.getenv calls retrieving GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT, PYTHONIOENCODING, PYTHONUTF8 environment variables",
  "sinks": "os.environ modifications in static method and instance method",
  "flows": "Constructor reads environment variables, static method sets environment variables to fixed values, instance method restores original environment variables",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; environment variables are being read and restored",
  "analysis": "The code initializes class attributes by reading specific environment variables. It provides a static method to set these environment variables to fixed values and an instance method to restore their original values. There are no signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated behavior. The environment variable handling appears to be related to configuration management rather than malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code manages environment variables for process configuration, with no malicious behavior detected. It simply reads and restores certain environment variables, which is typical for configuration purposes. No security threats or malware are present.",
