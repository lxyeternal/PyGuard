  "purpose": "Manage environment variables related to Git terminal prompt and Python encoding settings, allowing temporary modification and restoration.",
  "sources": "Environment variables read via os.getenv at initialization; environment variables set directly via os.environ in static and instance methods.",
  "sinks": "os.environ modifications, which influence runtime environment variables affecting other processes or subprocesses.",
  "flows": "Read environment variables during object initialization -> potentially modify environment variables via static method -> restore environment variables to previous values via instance method.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The code simply manages environment variables without external input validation or dynamic code execution. Variable names are obfuscated but do not appear malicious.",
  "analysis": "The class captures environment variables at instantiation, allowing restoration of previous values. The static method sets specific environment variables to fixed values, and the instance method restores previous values. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or system damage. The obfuscated class and method names are unusual but not malicious. The code appears to be designed for controlled environment management rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code manages environment variables in a standard manner without any malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation is likely for concealment but does not indicate malicious activity.",
