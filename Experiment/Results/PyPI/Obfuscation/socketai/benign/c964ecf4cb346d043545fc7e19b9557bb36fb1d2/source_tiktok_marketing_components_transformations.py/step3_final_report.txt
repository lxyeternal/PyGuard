  "purpose": "A data transformation class that iterates over 'metrics' in a record and sets entries to None if their value equals '-'.",

  "flows": "source: record['metrics'][metric_name], sink: setting value to None",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names; comparison to hardcoded string '-'",
  "analysis": "The code performs a benign data normalization by replacing metric values of '-' with None. No external network, file, or cryptographic operations are present. The obfuscation may be intended or malicious, but the logic itself is straightforward and harmless.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign data cleaning operation with obfuscated identifiers. No malicious activity or security risks are evident. The high obfuscation score is justified but does not indicate malicious intent.",
