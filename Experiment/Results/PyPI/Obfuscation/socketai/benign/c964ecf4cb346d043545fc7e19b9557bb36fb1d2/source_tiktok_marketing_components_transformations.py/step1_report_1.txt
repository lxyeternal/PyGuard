{
  "purpose": "A data transformation class intended to modify 'metrics' in a record by nullifying certain values based on a comparison.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'record', specifically 'record.get(\"metrics\", {})'.",
  "sinks": "Modification of 'record[\"metrics\"][...]' in place; no external sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'record' input to modification within the 'metrics' dictionary based on condition.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable and class names; no apparent secrets or hardcoded credentials. No network or external calls observed. The code is straightforward and does not perform any suspicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a dataclass that extends 'RecordTransformation'. The transformation method iterates over 'metrics' within the input record, nullifying values that match a specific sentinel value ('-'). Variable names are intentionally obfuscated, but the logic is simple and harmless: it's a data cleanup step. There are no external data sources, network calls, file I/O, or cryptographic operations. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The code is self-contained and performs a benign transformation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign data transformation with no malicious intent. It simply nullifies certain metric values based on a condition, with no indication of malicious behavior or security risks.",
