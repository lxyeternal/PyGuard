{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a module that imports a specific object or function from a relative source file and exposes a class or variable named 'SourceTiktokMarketing'.",
  "sources": "The code reads from a relative module '.source' and imports 'bSkWPLvpYBhvUWBPrZLVcQncSeslONbR'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or direct data leaks, injections, or untrusted data handling in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the only source is an import, which is standard for Python modules.",
  "anomalies": "The imported name 'bSkWPLvpYBhvUWBPrZLVcQncSeslONbR' is a non-descriptive, seemingly random string, which could be obfuscated or maliciously named, but without further context, this is not conclusive.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a single identifier with a non-descriptive, obfuscated name from a relative module. The __all__ list explicitly exposes 'SourceTiktokMarketing'. There are no other operations, data handling, or network activity. The import suggests modular code organization. The random-looking import name could be suspicious if it is part of obfuscation, but it is not inherently malicious without additional context. No data is processed or transmitted here.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet is a minimal module setup that imports an obfuscated symbol and exposes a class or variable. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks based solely on this code fragment. The only potential concern is the obfuscated import name, which might warrant further investigation in the full codebase.",
