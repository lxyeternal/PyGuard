{
  "purpose": "The code imports a specific symbol from a local module and defines an export list for the module.",
  "sources": "The code reads from a local module '.source' and the imported symbol 'bSkWPLvpYBhvUWBPrZLVcQncSeslONbR'.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks such as network, file writes, or execution points in the code provided.",
  "flows": "The flow is from importing 'bSkWPLvpYBhvUWBPrZLVcQncSeslONbR' from '.source' to the module namespace, then exposing 'SourceTiktokMarketing' in __all__.",
  "anomalies": "The imported symbol has a non-descriptive, obfuscated name which could be suspicious; no other anomalies are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, performing a straightforward import from a local module and setting an __all__ list. The symbol name 'bSkWPLvpYBhvUWBPrZLVcQncSeslONbR' is non-descriptive and looks obfuscated, which can sometimes be a tactic to hide malicious code. However, with only this fragment, there's no evidence of malicious behavior or malicious code execution. The purpose appears to be to expose 'SourceTiktokMarketing' as part of the module's public API. No input or output data flows or suspicious activities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module import and export statement with an obfuscated symbol name. There are no explicit malicious actions or security risks evident in this fragment. The obfuscated import name warrants caution, but on its own, it does not indicate malicious intent.",
