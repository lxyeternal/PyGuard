{
  "purpose": "Import a potentially obfuscated object from a local module and expose 'SourceTiktokMarketing' publicly.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .source module, specifically the object 'bSkWPLvpYBhvUWBPrZLVcQncSeslONbR'.",
  "sinks": "None in this fragment; no data leaks, network activity, or code execution observed.",
  "flows": "Import source -> module namespace; no data flow to external sinks or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a highly obfuscated, non-descriptive object name 'bSkWPLvpYBhvUWBPrZLVcQncSeslONbR', which is suspicious but not necessarily malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal import statement from a local module, with an obfuscated object name. No malicious activity, data leaks, or network operations are present. The obfuscated name suggests possible code obfuscation, which warrants further review of the 'source' module. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0-0.1, obfuscation: ~0.7, security risk: 0.2) are consistent with the minimal evidence of malicious intent. No active vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are demonstrated in this fragment. The primary concern is obfuscation, which is justified but does not confirm maliciousness.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign in isolation, with obfuscation being the main suspicious aspect. The low malware and security risk scores are appropriate. Further review of the 'source' module is recommended to ensure it does not contain malicious code hidden behind obfuscation.",
