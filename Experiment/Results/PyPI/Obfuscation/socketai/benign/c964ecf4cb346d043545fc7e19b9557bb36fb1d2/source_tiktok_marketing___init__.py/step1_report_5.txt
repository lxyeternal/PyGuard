{
  "purpose": "The code appears to import a specific object or function from a local module named 'source' and defines an export list containing 'SourceTiktokMarketing'.",
  "sources": "The code reads from a local module file 'source' when importing 'bSkWPLvpYBhvUWBPrZLVcQncSeslONbR'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks such as network calls, file writes, or execution of untrusted data present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Input is from the local module 'source' via import; there are no flows to external sinks or data leaks in this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The imported symbol 'bSkWPLvpYBhvUWBPrZLVcQncSeslONbR' has an obfuscated or non-meaningful name, which could be a sign of obfuscation or malicious intent, but it is not definitive on its own.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, performing a local import and defining an export list. The import name appears intentionally obfuscated, which could suggest an attempt to hide functionality. There are no network operations, data leaks, or suspicious code behaviors visible in this snippet. Without additional context, the code's purpose and potential malicious intent are unclear, but the obfuscated import name warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet alone does not demonstrate malicious behavior but contains obfuscated naming that could hide malicious intent in a larger context. The code is otherwise simple and does not include harmful operations.",
