{
  "purpose": "The code imports a specific object from a local module named 'source' and defines an exported list containing 'SourceTiktokMarketing'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the local module 'source' to import 'bSkWPLvpYBhvUWBPrZLVcQncSeslONbR'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any untrusted data handling or output operations.",
  "flows": "The imported object 'bSkWPLvpYBhvUWBPrZLVcQncSeslONbR' could potentially be used elsewhere; within this snippet, no flow occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The imported object name 'bSkWPLvpYBhvUWBPrZLVcQncSeslONbR' appears to be a randomly generated string, which may suggest obfuscation or an attempt to hide its purpose. The rest of the code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple import from a local module, using a name that appears obfuscated or auto-generated. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data leaks, or code execution. The use of an unusual variable name may suggest obfuscation, but without additional context, it cannot be conclusively malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet is a minimal import statement with a potentially obfuscated object name. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security risks in this fragment. The code appears benign but could be part of an obfuscated larger codebase.",
