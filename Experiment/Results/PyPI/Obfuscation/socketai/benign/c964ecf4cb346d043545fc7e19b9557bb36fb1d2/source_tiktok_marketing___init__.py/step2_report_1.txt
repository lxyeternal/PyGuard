  "review": "Let's analyze these reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code presence and functionality**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code performs a straightforward import from a local module `.source` and defines an `__all__` list exposing `SourceTiktokMarketing`. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks within this fragment.\n\n2. **Obfuscation and naming**:  \n   The imported symbol `bSkWPLvpYBhvUWBPrZLVcQncSeslONbR` appears to be a randomly generated string, which is suspicious. Obfuscated names can be used to hide malicious code or simply as part of automated code generation. The reports acknowledge this, with obfuscation scores around 0.7, which is reasonable.\n\n3. **Malicious activity**:  \n   None of the reports find evidence of malicious behavior in this fragment. The malware score is consistently low (0 or 0.1), indicating no direct signs of malware in this code snippet.\n\n4. **Security risks and data flows**:  \n   The code is minimal, with no data flows or sinks. The only potential concern is the obfuscated import name, which could be part of a larger malicious pattern elsewhere, but not in this fragment alone.\n\n5. **Scores review**:  \n   - The **malware scores** are appropriately low, reflecting no evident malicious activity.\n   - The **obfuscated scores** are high (~0.7), justified by the non-descriptive import name.\n   - The **security risk scores** are low (~0.2), consistent with the absence of active vulnerabilities.\n\n6. **Critical evaluation**:  \n   - The reports correctly note that the code is benign in isolation but caution about obfuscation.\n   - The potential for malicious intent depends on the content of the `source` module, which is not provided. The obfuscated name warrants further review of the module's implementation.\n\n7. **Conclusion and recommendations**:  \n   - The code itself is simple and does not exhibit malicious behavior.\n   - The obfuscated import name should be investigated in the context of the full codebase.\n   - No changes to the scores are necessary based on this fragment alone, but in a real review, the associated `source` module should be examined.\n\n**My overall assessment**:  \n- **Malware score**: 0.1 (consistent; no evidence of malware)  \n- **Obfuscated score**: 0.7 (justified by the naming)  \n- **Risk score**: 0.2 (appropriate given the minimal code and lack of active vulnerabilities)\n\n**Final note**: Without additional context or code from the `source` module, this fragment appears benign but warrants cautious review of the associated modules due to the obfuscated symbol name.",
