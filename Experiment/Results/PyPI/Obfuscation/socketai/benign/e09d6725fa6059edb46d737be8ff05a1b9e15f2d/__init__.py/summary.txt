  "conclusion": "The code appears safe, with the only concern being the obfuscated version identifier. No evidence of malicious behavior or active security threats is present. The low malware and risk scores are appropriate. Further investigation into the _version module may clarify the purpose of the obfuscated import, but current evidence suggests benign intent."
