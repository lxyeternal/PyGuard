{
  "purpose": "The code is a module setup importing version info and signal/file processing classes/functions, exposing them via __all__.",
  "sources": "Import statements from ._version and .pod5_format_pybind modules, specifically reading version info and class/function definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling; no untrusted data flow evident.",
  "flows": "Import of obfuscated identifier from version module; no active data flow or execution beyond imports.",
  "anomalies": "Import of an obscure, nonsensical identifier 'fpttrwmqdTfXhWZFNZyKmgQYVFGRpYuH' from _version module; minimal obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with no malicious code, network activity, or data processing. The only suspicious element is the obfuscated import, which could be benign or a concealment tactic. Scores assigned in reports are low for malware (0), with moderate obfuscation scores (~0.2-0.6). The overall security risk is minimal. The obfuscated import warrants further review of the _version module but does not indicate malicious intent based solely on this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears safe, with the only concern being the obfuscated version identifier. No evidence of malicious behavior or active security threats is present. The low malware and risk scores are appropriate. Further investigation into the _version module may clarify the purpose of the obfuscated import, but current evidence suggests benign intent.",
