  "purpose": "Assigning version information to variables, likely for package versioning",
  "sources": "Assignment statements of string and tuple literals",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output observed",
  "flows": "Direct assignment from literals to variables, no data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names that appear obfuscated or randomly generated, no meaningful naming",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string and version tuple to variables with seemingly random names. No external input, data processing, or network activity is present. Variable naming is unconventional but does not indicate malicious intent. The code does not perform any operations, input/output, or data manipulation beyond variable assignment.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign, serving only to store version information with obfuscated variable names. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
