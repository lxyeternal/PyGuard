  "purpose": "Assign version string and version tuple to variables",
  "sources": "No input or external data sources are used",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output functions are present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as code consists solely of variable assignments",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names that appear random or obfuscated, but no malicious activity detected",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string and version tuple to variables with seemingly random names. There are no input reads, no processing, and no output or external calls. The variable names do not match common patterns and may suggest obfuscation, but the actual code is simple and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs straightforward variable assignments with no malicious intent or security issues. The unusual variable names may be for obfuscation or naming style but do not indicate malicious behavior.",
