  "purpose": "Assigns version string and version tuple to variables with obfuscated names, serving as metadata.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; static string and tuple assignments.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows; static assignments only.",
  "flows": "Assignment of version data to variables; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated variable names for static version data; no malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string and tuple to variables with unusual names, but performs no dynamic or external operations. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, noting the obfuscation but no malicious activity. Malware scores are zero, security risks are absent, and confidence scores are high. The obfuscation is notable but not suspicious enough to indicate malicious intent, especially given the simplicity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as version metadata with obfuscated variable names. The scores and assessments across reports are consistent and appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
