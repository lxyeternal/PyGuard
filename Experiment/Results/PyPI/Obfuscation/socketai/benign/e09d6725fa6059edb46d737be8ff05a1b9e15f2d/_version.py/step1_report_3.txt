  "purpose": "Assigns version string and version tuple to variables, likely for package versioning.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded strings and tuples assigned to variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Direct assignment of static values to variables; no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names without context; no meaningful code logic or input handling.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable assignments with obfuscated variable names. The values assigned are static strings and tuples representing version information. There are no input sources, data processing, or any indication of malicious behavior. The code appears to be part of a version declaration for a package or module, but the variable names are non-standard and obscure, which could be suspicious if intended to hide malicious intent. However, based solely on this snippet, no malicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, benign version assignment with obfuscated variable names. No malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activities are detected in this code fragment.",
