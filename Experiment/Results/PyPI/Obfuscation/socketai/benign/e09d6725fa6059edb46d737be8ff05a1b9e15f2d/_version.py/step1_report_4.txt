  "purpose": "Assign version information to variables",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string and tuple assignments",
  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "None, as the code only assigns static values",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names that appear obfuscated, but no actual malicious behavior is evident",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string and a tuple representing the version components to variables with seemingly random, obfuscated names. There is no input handling, no network activity, no dynamic execution, or other suspicious behavior. The variable names do not follow typical conventions, which could indicate obfuscation, but that alone does not imply malicious intent. The code appears to serve as metadata or version tracking without any harmful operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple version assignment with obfuscated variable names, but it contains no malicious behavior, no security risks, and no suspicious activity.",
