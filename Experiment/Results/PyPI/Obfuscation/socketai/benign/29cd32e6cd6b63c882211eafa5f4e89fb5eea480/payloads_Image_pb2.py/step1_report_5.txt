{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define protobuf message schemas for image and video data structures, likely for serialization and deserialization purposes in a larger application.",
  "sources": "Loading protobuf definitions via AddSerializedFile and accessing default symbol database",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or malicious effects; code primarily defines data structures",
  "flows": "Serialization of data structures from protobuf schemas; no evident source-to-sink malicious data flow",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, or obfuscation present",
  "analysis": "The code imports protobuf modules, validates protobuf runtime version, and registers message schemas for image/video data. It uses serialized protobuf definitions to build descriptors. No external input, network operations, or data manipulation beyond protobuf schema setup. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard protobuf schema definition and registration script with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears to be part of a larger application that serializes/deserializes image and video data, with no evident malicious or sabotage behavior.",
