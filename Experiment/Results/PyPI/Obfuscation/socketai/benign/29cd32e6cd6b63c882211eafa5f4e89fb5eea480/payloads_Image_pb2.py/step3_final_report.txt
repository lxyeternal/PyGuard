  "purpose": "Protobuf message schema definitions for image and video data serialization.",
  "sources": "Serialized protobuf descriptor data loaded via AddSerializedFile, variable assignments for message types.",
  "sinks": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; no network or file operations observed.",
  "flows": "No external data input processed; code only sets up message descriptors.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of variable names, which is typical in generated protobuf code but can be suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is auto-generated protobuf setup code defining message types for RawImage, CompressedImage, and CompressedVideo. It performs version validation, loads serialized descriptors, and registers message types. There are no signs of data handling from untrusted sources, network activity, or malicious behavior. The obfuscated variable names are consistent with generated code, not malicious obfuscation. The malware score is appropriately zero; the obfuscation score is high due to variable naming but justified; the overall security risk is negligible.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign protobuf schema setup code with obfuscated variable names typical of generated code. No malicious or security-threatening behavior is present. The existing scores are appropriate; no adjustments needed.",
