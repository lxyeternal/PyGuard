  "purpose": "The code loads and defines protobuf message descriptors for Vector2 and Vector3 messages, which are used for serializing data structures.",
  "sources": "Imports from google.protobuf modules, serialized protobuf data, and runtime version validation functions.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or code execution; the code primarily sets up protobuf descriptors.",
  "flows": "Imports -> Validation -> Descriptor Pool -> Serialized File -> Build Descriptors -> Assignments",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names (e.g., gnbmZkrLITzExFXttxipwKUhrIjsATgC) and obfuscated-looking protobuf data. No clear hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious code patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes protobuf descriptors for Vector2 and Vector3 message types using serialized protobuf data. It performs runtime version validation. The variable names are obfuscated, which could suggest an attempt to hide intent, but this is common in auto-generated protobuf code. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious network activity is present. The code appears to be part of a protobuf message setup, typical in serialization libraries.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be auto-generated protobuf descriptor setup with obfuscated variable names. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks in the given code.",
