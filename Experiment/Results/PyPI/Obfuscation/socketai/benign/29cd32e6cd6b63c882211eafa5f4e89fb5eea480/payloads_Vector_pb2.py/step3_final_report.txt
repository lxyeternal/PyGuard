{
  "purpose": "This code loads protobuf schema data, performs runtime validation, and builds message descriptors for Vector2 and Vector3. It is likely autogenerated protobuf code.",
  "sources": "AddSerializedFile with serialized protobuf schema data, runtime version validation functions.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not handle external inputs, outputs, or perform network or file operations.",
  "flows": "Schema data is loaded from serialized bytes; no external data flows or untrusted data processing occur.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, which are typical in autogenerated protobuf code but may hinder readability.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard protobuf schema loader, performing validation and descriptor building without any network activity, data exfiltration, or code execution. Obfuscation is consistent with autogenerated code and does not imply malicious intent. No suspicious patterns, secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. The malware score is appropriately zero, and the security risk is minimal. The obfuscation score is moderate, reflecting typical autogenerated code, and the confidence is high that the code is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, autogenerated protobuf schema setup with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are justified and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0.75,
