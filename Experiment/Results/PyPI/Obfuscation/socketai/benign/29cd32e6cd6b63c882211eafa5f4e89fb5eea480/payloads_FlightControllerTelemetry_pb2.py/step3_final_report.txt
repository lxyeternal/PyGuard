  "purpose": "Auto-generated protobuf schema definitions for flight telemetry data, involving loading serialized message descriptors and performing version validation.",
  "sources": "Embedded serialized protobuf descriptor data, version validation functions, and descriptor pool initialization.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process external input or output data, nor does it perform network operations.",
  "flows": "The code loads serialized protobuf data into descriptors and builds message classes; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names and embedded serialized protobuf data are typical in generated code but can sometimes conceal malicious payloads; no malicious activity is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard protobuf generated module that loads message schemas, validates runtime version, and constructs descriptors. Variable names are obfuscated, which is common in auto-generated code, but no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection are present. The embedded serialized data is typical for protobuf schemas. The malware score is 0, reflecting no malicious activity. The obfuscation score (~0.75) is justified given the generated nature of the code. The security risk score (~0.2) is appropriate as the code only defines schemas without external interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign protobuf schema setup code with obfuscated variable names typical of generated code. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and should remain unchanged.",
