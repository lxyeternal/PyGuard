  "conclusion": "The code is a standard autogenerated protobuf schema loader for control system messages, with obfuscated variable names but no malicious or security-threatening behavior. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscation score at 0.8, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1-0.2). The reports are accurate and appropriate for this context."
