  "purpose": "This code serves as a minimal placeholder script, containing only a shebang line to specify the interpreter.",
  "sources": "No data sources; the code contains only a shebang line with no input or data reading operations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; there are no data flows, outputs, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows exist due to the absence of executable code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a plain shebang line with no obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple shebang line (`#!/usr/bin/env python`) with no additional logic, functions, or data handling. All reports correctly identify this minimal structure, with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content. There are no suspicious behaviors or vulnerabilities present. The code functions solely as a placeholder or interpreter directive, posing no threat or security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, minimal, and poses no security risks or malicious behavior. The reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are justified. No further action or concern is necessary.",
