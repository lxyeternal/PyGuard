{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a script with a shebang line indicating it is intended to be run as an executable Python script.",
  "sources": "The shebang line itself; no other input or data sources are present in the provided code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing occurs within the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows or processing steps are evident in this minimal code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only the shebang line; no other logic, data handling, or suspicious behavior is present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single line shebang indicating the script should be run with the environment's Python interpreter. It lacks any further code, data handling, or logic. There are no sources, sinks, or data flows to analyze. Since it is only a shebang, it does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The code is essentially empty and provides no functionality or potential attack vectors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a minimal, benign script with only a shebang line. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. The absence of code means no malicious activity is present.",
