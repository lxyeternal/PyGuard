  "purpose": "Documentation string describing the return value 'residual' for a computational function, indicating it measures accuracy and error in the computation.",
  "sources": "None; this is only a comment/docstring with no code execution or data input.",
  "targets": "None; no untrusted data processing or potential data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow; purely descriptive text.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; this is a standard docstring with no executable code or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The provided snippet is a docstring comment that describes a return value called 'residual' related to a solver object '_solver.snes'. It states that 'residual' measures the accuracy, convergence, and error of the computation. There are no code statements, data inputs, or operations; thus, it does not contain any malicious behavior or security issues. The content appears to be standard documentation typical in scientific or numerical Python code.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet is a harmless docstring documenting a return value. There are no signs of malicious code, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities. It is purely informational and does not present any security concern.",
