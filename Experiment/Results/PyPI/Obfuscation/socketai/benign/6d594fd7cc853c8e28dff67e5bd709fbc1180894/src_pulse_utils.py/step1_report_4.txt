  "purpose": "The provided code appears to be a comment or a docstring describing the purpose of an object related to global annotation for dolfin-adjoint.",
  "sources": "No actual data input or data reading code present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data processing points present.",
  "flows": "No data flow, input/output, or data processing present.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a comment or docstring with no executable code; indentation may be inconsistent or incorrect, but this alone is not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet is minimal, consisting only of a shebang line and what appears to be a comment or a docstring. There are no executable statements, data inputs, or suspicious constructs. The comment references global annotation for dolfin-adjoint, which is a scientific computing library, but the snippet itself does not perform any operations, data handling, or code execution. Therefore, there is no indication of malicious behavior or security issues within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This is a non-executable comment or documentation string providing context about global annotations in dolfin-adjoint. It contains no code that could be malicious or pose a security risk.",
