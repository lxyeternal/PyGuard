{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a shebang line followed by comments describing a global annotation for 'dolfin-adjoint'. It does not contain executable logic or data processing.",
  "sources": "Comments and shebang line; no data input, environment variables, or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data flows or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flows; code is purely comments with no operational logic.",
  "anomalies": "Improper indentation of comments, suggesting incomplete or placeholder code; no actual code or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The snippet contains only a shebang and comments describing a global annotation, with no executable code, data handling, or external interactions. The comments are improperly indented, indicating incomplete or placeholder content. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The lack of data flow, sinks, or sources confirms the benign nature of this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, incomplete, and comment-only. There are no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The scores should remain at malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
