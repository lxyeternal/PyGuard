{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for unloading, parameter estimation, and displacement calculations in biomechanical models, likely biomedical simulations involving mesh and material properties.",
  "sources": "Reads data from objects with attributes like 'mesh', 'fiber', 'markers'; file I/O for saving results; parameters for solver and material properties.",
  "sinks": "File writing to HDF5 files; potential data flow into computational routines; no network activity or external data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input objects and parameters into calculations, solver routines, and then into file storage; no external untrusted data sources detected.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of heavily obfuscated variable names such as 'HkeAkJzukEqaaxQOjZEgBwHaRJfeJzSC' and 'jtjSUHEPkyOLfkpQmGHmAkztarnxUqrU'; verbose placeholder-like comments; no executable malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be scientific or simulation code with superficial obfuscation, likely placeholders or for confidentiality. No malicious code, network activity, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not indicate malicious intent. The structure suggests a typical scientific computation pipeline with obfuscated identifiers.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign scientific simulation code with superficial obfuscation. No malware or malicious behavior is detected. The obfuscation seems to be for confidentiality or placeholder purposes rather than malicious intent.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0.75,
