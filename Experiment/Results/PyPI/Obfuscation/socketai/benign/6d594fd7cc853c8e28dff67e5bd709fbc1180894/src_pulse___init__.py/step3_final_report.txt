  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code content, patterns, and potential malicious signals.",
  "sources": "Input sources include command-line arguments, environment variables, user inputs, external modules, and data read from files or network connections.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks involve network transmissions, file operations, environment variable access, command execution, or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as inputs or environment variables to sinks like network or file operations, possibly via intermediate processing steps.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected; code appears straightforward or absent.",
  "analysis": "The code is either simple and benign, with no signs of malicious intent, or absent, limiting analysis. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious activities are observed. Scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the evidence. Confidence levels are high where code is present and low where code is missing. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors identified. Overall, the code appears safe, with minimal security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets and reports indicate no malicious or obfuscated code, and the security risk is very low. Scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No adjustments necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
