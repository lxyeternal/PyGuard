  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python module, defining metadata and reading version and README files.",
  "sources": "Reading 'VERSION' and 'README.rst' files from the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data is sent to external networks or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "File reading from local files during setup; no data flows to external entities or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The variable names are obfuscated, but no malicious code or backdoors are evident. The setup parameters seem standard, with no suspicious dependencies or code injections.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles package setup, reading local files for version and README contents. It does not execute untrusted input, perform network operations, or contain obfuscated code that executes dynamically. The obfuscated variable names appear to be stylistic choices and do not indicate malicious intent. The package configuration appears standard, with no hardcoded secrets or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard setup script for a Python package with no evidence of malicious activity, malware, or security risks. The obfuscated variable names do not impact the security assessment negatively.",
