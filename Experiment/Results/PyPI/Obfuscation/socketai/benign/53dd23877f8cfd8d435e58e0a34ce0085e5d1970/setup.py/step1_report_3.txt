{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for a Python package, defining package metadata and reading version and README files.",
  "sources": "Reading 'VERSION' file and 'README.rst' file from the package directory.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input or data. No network, file, or environment variable operations that accept untrusted data.",
  "flows": "File reads (version, README) occur during setup configuration; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names that appear obfuscated or auto-generated, but no malicious behavior detected. The code structure is typical for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules, reads version and README files for package metadata, and calls setuptools.setup() with package details. The variable names are unconventional, but all operations are limited to file reading and package configuration. No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are evident. There are no external network connections, no data exfiltration, and no dynamic code execution. The code appears to be a normal setup script with obfuscated variable names that do not affect security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with obfuscated variable names, and no malicious or security-threatening behavior detected. It appears to be legitimate and safe.",
