  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging, reading version and README files, and configuring package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads 'VERSION' file for version info, 'README.rst' for long description.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Reads local files and passes static metadata to setuptools.setup().",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; a non-standard parameter 'kirOEFOWmIwfdqVwuJksxPFgQzyrk' set to False in setup(), which appears suspicious or a typo.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with obfuscated variable names, which do not imply malicious intent. The unusual parameter in setup() is not a standard argument and may be a typo or obfuscation artifact. No network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration is detected. The obfuscation is superficial and does not impact security. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, low risk) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The suspicious parameter warrants verification but does not constitute malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated setup script with no malware or security risks. The obfuscation is superficial, and the suspicious parameter appears to be a typo or obfuscation artifact. Overall, the package is safe to use.",
