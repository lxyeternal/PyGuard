      "conclusion": "The code is a typical database client implementation with obfuscation that does not demonstrate malicious behavior. No evidence of sabotage, backdoors, or supply chain compromise is detected. The overall security risk is low, with minimal malware likelihood. Obfuscation levels vary but are likely for concealment rather than malicious purposes."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard credential retrieval routine with no malicious intent. The main security concern is the mention of a hardcoded secret, which, if present in the code, would constitute a significant vulnerability. Otherwise, the code itself is benign and does not exhibit malicious or obfuscated behavior."

      "obfuscated": 0.7,
      "confidence": 0.6,
      "conclusion": "The code is a skeleton with obfuscated identifiers and no implementation details, which warrants caution. While no direct malicious activity is evident, the obfuscation and absence of security measures justify further review. The overall risk is moderate, and the malware score remains low. Further investigation with complete code and security controls is recommended."

      "conclusion": "The reports are consistent and appropriately conservative, given the lack of actual code snippets. The zero malware and obfuscation scores are justified. Slightly lowering the risk score from 0.2 to 0.1 could better reflect the minimal risk in the absence of evidence, but current scores are acceptable. Overall, no adjustments are necessary; the assessments accurately reflect the available information."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The dependency code appears mostly benign, with some reports indicating patterns (eval(), obfuscation) that warrant moderate caution. Scores are consistent with the evidence; no major revisions necessary. Maintaining low malware and security risk scores for benign reports and a moderate score for suspicious patterns is justified."

      "conclusion": "The dependency contains significant signs of malicious behavior, especially in Report 5, including obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and suspicious network activity. The scores are consistent with the evidence, with Report 5 warranting a high malware and security risk rating. Other reports are appropriately scored as low risk with minimal suspicion. Overall, the dependency should be treated with caution, and further static/dynamic analysis is recommended before deployment."
