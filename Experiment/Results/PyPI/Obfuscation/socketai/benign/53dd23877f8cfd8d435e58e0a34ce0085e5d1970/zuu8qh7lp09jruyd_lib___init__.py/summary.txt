  "malware_score": 0.65,
  "security_risk": 0.75,
  "obfuscated": 0.7,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The dependency contains significant signs of malicious behavior, especially in Report 5, including obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and suspicious network activity. The scores are consistent with the evidence, with Report 5 warranting a high malware and security risk rating. Other reports are appropriately scored as low risk with minimal suspicion. Overall, the dependency should be treated with caution, and further static/dynamic analysis is recommended before deployment."
