{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility function within a larger Python project. No specific functional intent is clearly evident from the provided snippet.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from environment variables and possibly from user inputs or external files (if any). It might also import modules that could be sources depending on their use, but explicit source points are not shown.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writing, or execution of dynamic code if present. No explicit sinks such as network calls or system commands are visible in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or inputs through processing functions and potentially to sinks like files or network sockets. Due to limited code, exact flow paths cannot be definitively mapped.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are evident. The code uses standard library functions without obfuscation. No unusual dynamic execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports standard modules, processes data, and performs straightforward operations. No malicious patterns, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious network activity, are observable. The structure appears typical for utility or data handling scripts. Absence of hardcoded secrets or suspicious function calls reduces concern. Limited context prevents detection of hidden behavior.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain attack vectors. The code appears benign, focusing on standard data processing without suspicious activities.",
