  "purpose": "Assess the potential maliciousness, obfuscation, and security risks of the provided code snippets or descriptions.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include code snippets, environment variables, network operations, and data processing functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks involve network connections, file operations, environment variable access, and data output points.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as input functions or environment variables to sinks like network or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No actual code provided; all reports lack concrete code snippets, only descriptions or placeholders. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify the absence of code, limiting detailed analysis. Scores for malware and obfuscation are zero, aligning with no evidence of malicious or obfuscated code. Security risk scores are low (around 0.2), reflecting cautious default estimates in the absence of concrete evidence. Confidence levels vary but are generally moderate, acknowledging uncertainty due to missing code. The assessments are consistent and reasonable, with no anomalies or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The reports are consistent and appropriately conservative, given the lack of actual code snippets. The zero malware and obfuscation scores are justified. Slightly lowering the risk score from 0.2 to 0.1 could better reflect the minimal risk in the absence of evidence, but current scores are acceptable. Overall, no adjustments are necessary; the assessments accurately reflect the available information.",
