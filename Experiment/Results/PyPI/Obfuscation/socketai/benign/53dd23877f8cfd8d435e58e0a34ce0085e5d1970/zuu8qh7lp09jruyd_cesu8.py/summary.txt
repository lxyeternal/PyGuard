  "conclusion": "The reports are consistent and appropriately conservative, given the lack of actual code snippets. The zero malware and obfuscation scores are justified. Slightly lowering the risk score from 0.2 to 0.1 could better reflect the minimal risk in the absence of evidence, but current scores are acceptable. Overall, no adjustments are necessary; the assessments accurately reflect the available information."
