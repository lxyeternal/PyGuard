{
  "purpose": "Define a series of custom exception classes, some inheriting from each other, with no additional functionality or behavior.",
  "sources": "No explicit input sources; code only defines classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing, output, or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flows; class definitions are static with no data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deep inheritance chains and class names with random strings. No code execution, external calls, or data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions with non-descriptive, seemingly random class names. No input/output, data processing, or external interactions are present. The inheritance pattern is straightforward, and constructors only pass parameters to parent classes. No signs of obfuscation techniques or malicious behavior such as code execution, data exfiltration, or external network activity are evident. The naming convention suggests possible obfuscation or autogenerated code, but without behavioral logic, this is benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of class definitions for custom exceptions with no operational logic, data handling, or external interactions. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks based on the provided code.",
