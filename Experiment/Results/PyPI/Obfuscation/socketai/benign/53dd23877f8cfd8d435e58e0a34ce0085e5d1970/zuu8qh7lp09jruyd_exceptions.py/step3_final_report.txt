{
  "purpose": "Define multiple custom exception classes with obfuscated or nonsensical class names, inheriting from each other with minimal constructors, without any operational logic or external interactions.",
  "sources": "Class definitions, inheritance hierarchies, constructor parameters",
  "sinks": "None; no data input/output, external calls, or data flows",
  "flows": "None; no data or control flow beyond class inheritance",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class names, minimal constructors, no functional code, potential obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of class definitions for custom exceptions with obfuscated names, no data processing, external calls, or malicious activity. The high obfuscation score reflects the nonsensical class names, but there is no evidence of malicious behavior such as code execution, data exfiltration, or network activity. The malware score should be zero, as no malicious intent is evident. The obfuscation score remains high due to class name obfuscation, and the overall security risk is very low, given the lack of operational or external interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting only of obfuscated exception class definitions with no malicious or operational behavior. The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not indicate malicious intent. The malware risk is negligible, and the security risk is minimal.",
