{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script, likely intended for general execution or specific data processing tasks.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables and file I/O operations.",
  "sinks": "Data outputs to the console, logs, or files; potentially sends data over network if network functions are used.",
  "flows": "Data from environment variables or input files flows through processing functions to output or network sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. No suspicious URL connections or code injections identified.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical data handling operations, including reading environment variables, processing data, and writing outputs. No malicious functions such as network exfiltration, code execution, or data theft are apparent. Usage of standard libraries and absence of suspicious code patterns indicate no malicious intent. The code structure and logic are consistent with legitimate functions.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code appears benign and safe for use.",
