  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, supply chain risks, and security issues.",
  "sources": "Potential dynamic code execution points (eval()/exec()), data input functions, environment variable reads, network calls, file operations.",
  "sinks": "Network communication (data exfiltration), file modifications, environment variable access, system commands.",
  "flows": "Input sources (e.g., user input, environment variables) to sinks via functions like eval(), exec(), or network calls.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval()/exec() without clear sanitization, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation patterns, inconsistent variable naming, suspicious network domains.",
  "analysis": "Most reports correctly identify code patterns such as eval() and obfuscation as suspicious but lack concrete evidence of malicious payloads. Report 4 notes obfuscation and dynamic execution, justifying moderate suspicion. Reports 2 and 3 are benign with no suspicious patterns. Report 1 overstates risk based on suspicion without direct evidence. Scores are generally aligned with the described code features, with Report 4 appropriately reflecting higher suspicion. Slight adjustments to malware scores could be made if eval() or secrets are not explicitly confirmed, but current scores are reasonable given the patterns observed.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency code appears mostly benign, with some reports indicating patterns (eval(), obfuscation) that warrant moderate caution. Scores are consistent with the evidence; no major revisions necessary. Maintaining low malware and security risk scores for benign reports and a moderate score for suspicious patterns is justified.",
