  "conclusion": "The dependency code appears mostly benign, with some reports indicating patterns (eval(), obfuscation) that warrant moderate caution. Scores are consistent with the evidence; no major revisions necessary. Maintaining low malware and security risk scores for benign reports and a moderate score for suspicious patterns is justified."
