  "purpose": "Provide compatibility functions for Jinja2, enabling support across different Python versions.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from the Python sys module.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks that process untrusted data or external inputs.",
  "flows": "Reads sys.version_info, but no data flows to insecure sinks or external outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscated code present. The code appears straightforward and intended for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the sys module and defines compatibility functions for different Python versions, such as text_type and string_types. It relies on sys.version_info to determine Python version and conditionally defines variables. There are no signs of malicious behavior like data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The structure is clear, and the code serves a standard purpose in a widely used library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility layer for the Jinja2 library, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
