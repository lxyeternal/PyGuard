  "purpose": "Compatibility functions for Jinja2 to support different Python versions.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard library modules (sys, functools) and internal variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; code primarily defines compatibility functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides compatibility shims for Python 2 and 3, such as defining string types and URL handling. It uses standard library imports and conditional checks based on Python version. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious intent are evident. The structure and content are typical for a compatibility module, with no obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility helper for Jinja2, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
