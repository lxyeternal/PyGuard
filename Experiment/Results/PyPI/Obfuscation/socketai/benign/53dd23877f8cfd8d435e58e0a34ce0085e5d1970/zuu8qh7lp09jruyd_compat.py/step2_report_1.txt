  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose and sources align with a typical compatibility module.\n- No sinks, flows, anomalies, or suspicious behavior.\n- The analysis confirms standard compatibility code.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to report 1, standard version checks and imports.\n- No suspicious activity or anomalies.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Again, standard compatibility code, no external input or untrusted data.\n- No anomalies or malicious indicators.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same pattern: version info from sys, no suspicious flows.\n- No anomalies or malicious behavior.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Compatibility support with no signs of malicious activity.\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but consistent with the rest.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports describe code that matches the original code snippet: compatibility functions for different Python versions, no malicious or obfuscated patterns.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n- **Scores:** All are consistent with the descriptions; no need to adjust.\n- **Malware risk:** Zero across all reports, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None based on the provided descriptions; all are standard compatibility layers.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n\n- The malware scores are correctly set to 0.\n- The risk scores are appropriately low, given the benign purpose.\n- The confidence levels are high, reflecting thorough analysis.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0 — standard compatibility code with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nAll reports correctly identify the code as standard, benign compatibility support with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores are justified and should remain as they are.",
