  "purpose": "Provide compatibility functions for Jinja2 to support different Python versions.",
  "sources": "Standard library imports and version checks, no external input reading.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code does not process untrusted data or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code primarily defines conditional imports and compatibility shims.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed. The code is a typical compatibility module authored by Armin Ronacher.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of conditional imports based on Python version, intended to support different runtime environments. It includes standard import statements, version checks, and function definitions that adapt to the environment. No data is read from external sources, and no untrusted data is processed or output. The code appears standard for a compatibility layer without any malicious constructs or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard compatibility module for Jinja2, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It performs version-based imports and definitions, which are common practices. There are no anomalies or malicious indicators present.",
