  "purpose": "Compatibility functions for Jinja2 supporting different Python versions.",
  "sources": "Standard library modules and internal variables such as sys.version_info.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static compatibility checks.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward version checks and conditional imports.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard compatibility layer authored by Armin Ronacher, involving version checks and conditional definitions. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. The malware score is appropriately zero; obfuscation is absent. The risk score should be very low (around 0.1) due to its critical but benign role, but no security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard compatibility support module with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores in the reports are accurate; only the risk score could be slightly lowered to better reflect the minimal inherent risk.",
