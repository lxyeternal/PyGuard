  "purpose": "Compatibility support for Jinja2 template engine across Python versions.",
  "sources": "Potentially uses standard library modules or version detection code.",
  "sinks": "No identifiable sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard compatibility shim, likely containing version checks and imports for different Python versions. The author and license are typical for open-source projects. No suspicious patterns, code injection, or malicious logic are present. The code's purpose aligns with providing backward compatibility, not executing untrusted data or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility module for Jinja2 with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
