  "sources": "Import statements and conditional logic for version compatibility.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no untrusted data handling or output functions.",
  "flows": "N/A, as the code primarily defines imports and compatibility shims.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code contains standard version compatibility code, importing modules conditionally based on Python version. It uses straightforward conditional checks and imports, with no evidence of malicious code or obfuscated logic. The code's purpose is to provide compatibility support, not to perform any harmful operations. There are no sources of untrusted data, no dangerous sinks, and no unusual flow patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard compatibility code with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves a legitimate purpose within the Jinja2 project.",
