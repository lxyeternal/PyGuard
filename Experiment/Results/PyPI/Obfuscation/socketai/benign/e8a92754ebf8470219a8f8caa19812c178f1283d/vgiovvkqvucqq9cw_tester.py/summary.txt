  "conclusion": "The code is a fixture management utility with no active malware but employs unsafe deserialization practices that pose a moderate security risk if fixture files are manipulated. The obfuscation and import style are typical of testing code but warrant caution. Overall, the malware score is 0, obfuscation is justified at 0.3, and the security risk is 0.5 due to unsafe pickle usage."
