  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully and evaluate their findings, scores, and underlying assumptions.\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Behavior in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the provided code snippet is *extremely minimal*, consisting only of a shebang line and a usage comment with no executable logic.\n   - There are no input/output operations, no data processing, no network calls, no code execution, and no embedded secrets.\n   - The placeholder filename `???` suggests incomplete code, not malicious intent.\n   - **Conclusion:** No evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or suspicious activity is present in the code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent in stating that the code is a placeholder or stub with no actual logic.\n   - They appropriately note the absence of data flows, sinks, or sources.\n   - No report seems to overstate or misinterpret the minimal content; their reasoning is sound.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware` score: 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious indicators.\n     - `obfuscated` score: 0, since there's no obfuscated code.\n     - `securityRisk` score: 0, given the lack of any functional or operational code.\n   - The `confidence` scores vary between 0.3 and 1, reflecting differing degrees of certainty about the code's benign nature. Given the minimal and non-functional nature, a high confidence (close to 1) is justified.\n   - The scores seem reasonable overall.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - No report assigns a `securityRisk` or `malware` score above 0.0, which is appropriate.\n   - Since the code is just a placeholder, there's no justification for higher risk scores.\n\n5. **Potential Assumptions and Claims:**\n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as incomplete and non-malicious.\n   - No claims are based on unfounded assumptions.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with Content:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the code snippet's content and context.\n   - The confidence levels are appropriate, considering the minimal information.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation present.  \n**Risk score:** 0 — no security risk or vulnerabilities evident.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. They correctly identify that the code is a placeholder with no malicious or security concerns. The scoring aligns with the content, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Overall Recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores. The code is benign, and the assessments are appropriate.",
