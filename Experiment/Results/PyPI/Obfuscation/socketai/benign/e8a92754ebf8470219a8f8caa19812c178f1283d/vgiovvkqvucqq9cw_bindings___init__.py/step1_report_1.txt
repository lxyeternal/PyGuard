  "purpose": "The code appears to be a placeholder or a very minimal script intended for file analysis or processing, as indicated by the usage comment.",
  "sources": "No actual input or data reading mechanisms are present in the code snippet provided.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are evident; the code does not perform any operations or write data.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists in the provided snippet; no source-to-sink paths are present.",
  "anomalies": "The script contains only a shebang and a usage comment with no executable logic, no hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs. The '???' in the filename suggests a placeholder, but that alone is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet is extremely minimal, consisting solely of a shebang line and a usage comment. It lacks any executable code, input handling, or data processing. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity. The placeholder filename indicates incomplete code, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a non-functional placeholder with no malicious behavior or security risks evident. It serves as a template or initial scaffold for a script that is yet to be implemented.",
