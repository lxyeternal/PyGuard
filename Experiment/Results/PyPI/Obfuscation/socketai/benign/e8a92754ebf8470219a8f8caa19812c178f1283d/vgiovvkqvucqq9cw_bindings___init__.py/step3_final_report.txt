  "purpose": "Placeholder script with shebang and usage comment, serving as a template or scaffold.",
  "sources": "No actual data input or external data sources; only a shebang and usage comment present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing, output, or external calls are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; code contains no executable logic or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of only shebang and comment; filename contains '???' indicating incomplete placeholder, but no malicious or suspicious anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal placeholder with no executable logic, input/output, or data flow. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and lack of operational content support a benign assessment. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0) are consistent with the code's content. Confidence in this conclusion is high due to the absence of any suspicious or malicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign placeholder with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the minimal content. No further action is necessary.",
