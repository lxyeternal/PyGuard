{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be a template or stub indicating a script that processes an input file, but it does not contain actual implementation code.",
  "sources": "The code does not read any input or data beyond the command-line argument placeholder.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no data is processed or outputted.",
  "flows": "No data flow is observable as there is no executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "The script contains only a shebang and a usage comment, with no functional code, configuration, or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of a shebang line and a usage comment. There are no functions, variable assignments, data processing, or external library calls. Given the absence of executable code, there are no security concerns or malicious indicators present. Its purpose seems to be instructive or as a placeholder for future implementation. Due to the lack of any logic or data handling, there are no source-to-sink flows, anomalies, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a non-functional stub with no executable code, data processing, or external interactions. It poses no security threat, malware risk, or malicious intent based on its current form.",
