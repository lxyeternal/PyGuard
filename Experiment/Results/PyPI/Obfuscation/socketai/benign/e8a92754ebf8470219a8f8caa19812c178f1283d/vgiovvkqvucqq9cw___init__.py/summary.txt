  "conclusion": "The code functions as an obfuscated XML-RPC client with legitimate-looking network interactions. While the obfuscation raises concerns about concealment, there is no direct evidence of malicious payloads or backdoors. The malware score is low, but the obfuscation score is high, and the overall security risk is moderate. Continuous review and full context are recommended before deployment in security-sensitive environments."
