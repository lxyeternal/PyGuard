      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard package setup with superficial obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The obfuscation likely aims to conceal variable names but does not serve malicious purposes."

      "conclusion": "The code functions as an obfuscated XML-RPC client with legitimate-looking network interactions. While the obfuscation raises concerns about concealment, there is no direct evidence of malicious payloads or backdoors. The malware score is low, but the obfuscation score is high, and the overall security risk is moderate. Continuous review and full context are recommended before deployment in security-sensitive environments."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign environment-dependent import pattern with obfuscated variable names. No malicious activity, backdoors, or vulnerabilities are evident. The obfuscation warrants attention for maintainability but does not indicate malicious intent. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."

      "conclusion": "The code is primarily resource management with obfuscation and decoding steps that could be exploited if malicious inputs are provided. No direct malware or malicious activity is confirmed, but the potential for misuse exists. The overall security risk is moderate, and obfuscation warrants attention."

      "conclusion": "The code is a resource and permission handling utility with significant obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or supply chain risks. The obfuscation appears to be for concealment or minimization, not malicious activity. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the code's benign nature. Overall, the code is safe and does not pose a security threat."

      "confidence": 0.85,
      "conclusion": "The code is a fixture management utility with no active malware but employs unsafe deserialization practices that pose a moderate security risk if fixture files are manipulated. The obfuscation and import style are typical of testing code but warrant caution. Overall, the malware score is 0, obfuscation is justified at 0.3, and the security risk is 0.5 due to unsafe pickle usage."

The obfuscated object name alone does not justify high obfuscation scores. The low malware and risk scores are appropriate. No further action is needed unless actual implementation code is provided, which could reveal vulnerabilities or malicious behavior."
