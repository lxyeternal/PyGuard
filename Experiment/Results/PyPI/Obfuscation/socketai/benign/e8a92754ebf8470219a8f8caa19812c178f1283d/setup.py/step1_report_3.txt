{
  "purpose": "The code is for setting up a Python package distribution using setuptools, defining dependencies, and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading package version, system information, and importing modules.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no untrusted data flows or external data handling are present.",
  "flows": "No malicious data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; code mainly initializes variables and calls setup().",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are obfuscated with nonsensical names, but this does not necessarily indicate malicious intent. The code dynamically constructs a version string and modifies dependencies based on Python version, which is typical. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports modules, defines dependencies, and sets up package metadata. It obfuscates variable names, likely for code concealment, but no malicious or suspicious logic is present. The conditional version check adjusts dependencies, which is common. No external network connections, data leaks, or code injections are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script for a Python package with obfuscated variable names. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected. It mainly performs package configuration and dependency management.",
