{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for a Python package, configuring dependencies, versioning, and metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "Standard modules like setuptools, sys, path, and version strings; no untrusted input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network activity, or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "flows": "Initialization of version suffix based on Python version; dependency list; setup() call with metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; version string concatenation with suffixes like 'rc1' and 'b1'; superficial obfuscation without malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with obfuscated variable names, likely to conceal or evade static analysis. It performs version-based dependency adjustments and calls setup() with package metadata. No network activity, data leaks, code injection, or external data handling are present. The obfuscation appears superficial and does not impact functionality or security. The version suffixes are standard for release candidates or beta versions, not indicators of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard package setup with superficial obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The obfuscation likely aims to conceal variable names but does not serve malicious purposes.",
