{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package, specifying dependencies, package metadata, and classifiers.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from the 'sys' module, defining dependency list, accessing 'path' module for directory path, and setting up package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or user input; the code only defines package configuration.",
  "flows": "Not applicable as there are no data flow paths involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variable names (e.g., VmvPTAuDoOWVkRXgzlhDWgzePhEgUvyv) and inconsistent formatting, which could be a sign of obfuscation or concealment.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up package configuration via 'setup()'. It dynamically determines version suffixes based on Python version, which is typical. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are processed during runtime. Variable names are intentionally obscure, but the code performs straightforward package setup operations without malicious behavior. The obfuscation seems superficial, possibly to evade casual inspection, but there are no malicious actions or hidden backdoors. No suspicious network activity or data leaks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script functions as a standard package setup script with obfuscated variable names, likely for concealment. There are no indicators of malicious intent, malware, or security risks within this code.",
