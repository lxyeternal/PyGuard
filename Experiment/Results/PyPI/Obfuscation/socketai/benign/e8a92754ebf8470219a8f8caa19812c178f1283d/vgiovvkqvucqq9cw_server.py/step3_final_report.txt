  "purpose": "Conditional import of modules based on environment variable 'PYONE_TEST_FIXTURE' to toggle between test and production modules.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable 'PYONE_TEST_FIXTURE' using os.environ.get.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or external effects detected.",
  "flows": "Environment variable input influences which module is imported; no further data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; use of dynamic import based on environment variable; no malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward environment variable check to determine module import path, with obfuscated variable names that hinder readability but do not indicate malicious intent. No signs of code injection, network activity, or data exfiltration are present. The logic is typical for environment-based configuration toggling. Malware score is 0, as no malicious behavior is evident. Obfuscation score is moderate (0.5), reflecting the obscure variable names. Security risk score is low (0.2), consistent with benign logic. The obfuscation alone does not imply malicious intent; it may serve to hide implementation details but does not constitute a security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign environment-dependent import pattern with obfuscated variable names. No malicious activity, backdoors, or vulnerabilities are evident. The obfuscation warrants attention for maintainability but does not indicate malicious intent. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
