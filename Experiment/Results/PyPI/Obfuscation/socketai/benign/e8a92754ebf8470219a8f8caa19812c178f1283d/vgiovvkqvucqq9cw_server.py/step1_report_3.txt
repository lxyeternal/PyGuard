  "flows": "Environment variable 'PYONE_TEST_FIXTURE' influences the import path",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names and dynamic import logic; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code behavior",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves an environment variable 'PYONE_TEST_FIXTURE' to determine which module to import. If the variable indicates 'False' (or similar), it imports a local module; otherwise, it imports a module from a package. The variable name and function names are obfuscated, which could be an attempt to hide functionality or simply to avoid easy detection. No malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious behavior are evident. The code appears to toggle between two import paths based on environment configuration, typical in testing vs. production environments.",
  "conclusion": "This code does not show malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a conditional import mechanism based on an environment variable, likely for testing purposes. No malware or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
