{
  "purpose": "The code provides deprecated routines for plotting Venn diagrams, with no active logic or malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters related to plotting configurations and deprecation notices.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks; the code does not process or output data beyond warnings and function calls.",
  "flows": "The code flow is limited to displaying deprecation warnings; no data flows or malicious data handling are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscated elements are present; the code is straightforward and deprecated.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of deprecated plotting routines with deprecation warnings, no active logic, and no malicious or suspicious behavior. The reports are empty, providing no evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious activity. The code is benign, and the lack of detailed findings indicates minimal risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, deprecated plotting utility routines with no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues. The reports do not indicate any problems. Therefore, malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is approximately 0.1 due to deprecation status.",
