  "purpose": "Mathematical utility functions for geometric calculations and plotting routines, including circle intersections, point-in-circle checks, and vector operations.",
  "sources": "Function parameters, internal calculations; no external data or network sources.",
  "sinks": "No external data leaks, network activity, or system modifications detected.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow through geometric functions to produce results; no external sinks or data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variable names and nonsensical comments (e.g., 'DlEEwIuZgUSkwDfGrXLDjhNmyiZWRHLP'), which appear superficial and possibly auto-generated.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard geometric functions such as circle intersection, point-in-circle, and vector angle calculations. The obfuscation appears superficial, with variable names and comments designed to hinder readability but not to conceal malicious behavior. No network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications are present. The functions do not process untrusted input sources in a way that suggests malicious intent. The obfuscation scores are higher due to the comments and variable names, but the core logic remains benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of geometric utility functions with superficial obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious payloads, data leaks, or sabotage. The low malware score (0.0) and minimal security risk (0.1) are justified. Obfuscation appears to be for concealment or auto-generation rather than malicious intent.",
