  "purpose": "Visualization of set overlaps with matplotlib and matplotlib-venn.",

  "sinks": "Plotting functions, warnings.",
  "flows": "Data from inputs to visualization routines.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated import 'matplotlib_venn._math', nonsensical variable names, suspicious 'os' attribute usage.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily for generating Venn diagrams, with heavy obfuscation and variable name nonsense. No network or file I/O, no malicious payloads. The environment check is suspicious but not malicious. The obfuscated import paths and strange attribute access on 'os' suggest possible concealment or anti-analysis techniques. No evidence of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, network connections, or system modification is present. The heavy obfuscation and suspicious attribute usage are red flags but do not confirm malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be primarily for visualization purposes, heavily obfuscated, with suspicious patterns such as obfuscated attribute access on 'os'. There is no concrete evidence of malicious payloads or sabotage, but the obfuscation warrants cautious monitoring. The malware score is low (~0.2), the obfuscation score is high (~0.7), and the overall security risk is moderate (~0.3).",
