  "conclusion": "The code appears to be primarily for visualization purposes, heavily obfuscated, with suspicious patterns such as obfuscated attribute access on 'os'. There is no concrete evidence of malicious payloads or sabotage, but the obfuscation warrants cautious monitoring. The malware score is low (~0.2), the obfuscation score is high (~0.7), and the overall security risk is moderate (~0.3)."
