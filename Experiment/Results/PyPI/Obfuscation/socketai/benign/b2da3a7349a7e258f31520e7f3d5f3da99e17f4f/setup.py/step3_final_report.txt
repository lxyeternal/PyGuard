  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, defining package metadata, version extraction, and test command.",
  "sources": "Reading version string from 'matplotlib_venn/__init__.py'; class and variable definitions; no external data or input handling.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network calls, file writes, or external communications observed.",
  "flows": "Version string extracted via string splitting; test command runs pytest; no external data flow or malicious payloads.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names; setting of variable 'cOYQqTKirqBAKkVZhPgFUTMQSXGlflgP' to True without clear purpose; superficial obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with superficial obfuscation. No malicious code, external network activity, or data exfiltration detected. Version extraction is fragile but typical. Obfuscation appears to be for concealment rather than malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign package setup with superficial obfuscation. No evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation does not indicate malicious intent, and the code performs typical setup tasks.",
