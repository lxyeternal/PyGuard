  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package, including test command customization and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'matplotlib_venn/__init__.py' for version string, package metadata, and configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "None identified explicitly; no untrusted data handling or output functions observed.",
  "flows": "Reading version info from file → using setup() with package metadata → executing pytest via custom test command.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains obfuscated variable names and a complex string split operation for version extraction, which could be considered suspicious or unnecessary complexity. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code are evident. The variable 'cOYQqTKirqBAKkVZhPgFUTMQSXGlflgP' is set to True without clear purpose, possibly obfuscated or placeholder.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup utilities from setuptools and defines a custom test command class that executes pytest. It extracts the version number from 'matplotlib_venn/__init__.py' by parsing the file for '__version__'. The setup() call specifies package metadata, dependencies, and test configurations. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are present. The obfuscated variable names and string operations suggest possible intentional obscurity but do not indicate malicious intent. The code appears to be a standard package setup with some obfuscation or code noise.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a package setup script with a custom test command and obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The obfuscation appears to be superficial, likely for code concealment or complexity. Overall, the script is a typical setup configuration with minor suspicious naming but no security concerns.",
