{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for a Python package, including version extraction and test command customization.",
  "sources": "Reading 'matplotlib_venn/__init__.py' for version info; importing modules; reading setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "No clear sink functions that process untrusted input; setup parameters are static.",
  "flows": "Reading version info from a file, passing static parameters to setup.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; dynamic version extraction method; unusual variable naming; no hardcoded credentials or malicious code evident.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs package setup with version extraction from a source file, defines a custom test command class, and specifies dependencies and metadata. Variable names are obfuscated, but their usage is standard for package configuration. No signs of data exfiltration, network activity, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The code is consistent with typical setup scripts and contains no suspicious logic or behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup configuration with obfuscated variable names but no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
