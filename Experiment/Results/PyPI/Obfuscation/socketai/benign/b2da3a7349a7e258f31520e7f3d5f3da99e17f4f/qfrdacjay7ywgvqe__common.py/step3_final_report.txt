{
  "purpose": "The code provides visualization utilities for Venn diagrams and related graphical elements using matplotlib, with heavily obfuscated class and variable names.",
  "sources": "Reads data from class attributes, method parameters, and sequences of patches, texts, points, and floats; no external data sources or network calls.",
  "sinks": "Manipulates matplotlib objects locally; no data leaks, network transmissions, or system modifications detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sequences into matplotlib object methods for visualization; no external or untrusted data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with nonsensical class and variable names; no malicious code or suspicious external calls present.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily for plotting visual elements such as patches, labels, and points. Obfuscation is evident but appears to serve proprietary or protective purposes rather than malicious intent. No network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications are detected. The functions perform standard numpy and matplotlib operations, with no suspicious logic or payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a visualization utility with high obfuscation but no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation score is justified, and malware risk is minimal. Overall, the code appears benign, primarily serving visualization purposes.",
