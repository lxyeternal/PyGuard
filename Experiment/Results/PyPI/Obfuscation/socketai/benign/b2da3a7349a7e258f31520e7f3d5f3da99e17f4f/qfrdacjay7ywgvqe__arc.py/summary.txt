  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate geometric utility library with significant obfuscation that may hinder readability but does not exhibit malicious intent or security risks. The high obfuscation score is justified, and the malware score remains zero. Overall, the code is safe but warrants caution due to obfuscation."
