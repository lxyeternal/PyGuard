  "purpose": "A geometric utility library for plotting and manipulating arcs, encapsulating arc properties and calculations such as length, area, and intersection points.",
  "sources": "Input data includes arc parameters (center, radius, start and end angles, direction) and points for geometric calculations.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network calls, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from arc parameter inputs to calculations of points, lengths, intersections, and sub-arc extraction; no external untrusted data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with scrambled variable names and comments (e.g., 'DlEEwIuZgUSkwDfGrXLDjhNmyiZWRHLP'), but no malicious code patterns or suspicious behaviors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code implements geometric calculations for arcs, including length, area, intersection, and point conversion functions. The obfuscation appears superficial, primarily involving variable names and comments, without evidence of malicious operations such as network activity, data leaks, or code injection. The malware score is set to 0, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior. The obfuscation score is high (~0.75), justified by the scrambled identifiers. The security risk is low (~0.15), as the code performs standard geometric computations without vulnerabilities. Confidence in this assessment is high due to the detailed analysis and lack of malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate geometric utility library with significant obfuscation that may hinder readability but does not exhibit malicious intent or security risks. The high obfuscation score is justified, and the malware score remains zero. Overall, the code is safe but warrants caution due to obfuscation.",
