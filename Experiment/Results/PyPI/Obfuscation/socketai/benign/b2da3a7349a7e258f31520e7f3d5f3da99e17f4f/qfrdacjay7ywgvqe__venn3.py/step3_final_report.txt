{
  "purpose": "Visualization of set operations and diagrams, primarily for creating Venn diagrams with customizable labels, colors, and layout.",
  "sources": "Function arguments, imported modules, matplotlib axes, set data structures.",
  "sinks": "matplotlib rendering functions (add_patch, text), warnings, and color processing routines.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into visualization routines, creating patches and annotations without external data leaks or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation through variable names and complex set operations; no suspicious network or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs legitimate visualization tasks—creating circles, computing intersections, setting colors, and rendering patches. Obfuscation appears to be for concealment rather than malicious intent. No signs of malicious activity such as network communication, data theft, or sabotage are present. The obfuscation level is moderate to high but consistent with concealment rather than malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate visualization library for Venn diagrams, with obfuscation likely for concealment. No evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities was found. Malware score is 0, security risk is low (~0.2), and obfuscation is moderate (~0.6).",
