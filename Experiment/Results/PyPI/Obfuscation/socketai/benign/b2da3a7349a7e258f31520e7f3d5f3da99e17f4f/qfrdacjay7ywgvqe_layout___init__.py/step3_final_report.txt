{
  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code reads input data, performs data processing, network/file operations, and may include dynamic execution constructs.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or execution of dynamic code that could lead to data leaks or system compromise.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input or data variables flow into processing functions, with potential sinks being network or file operations, especially if eval/exec are used.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval/exec, hardcoded strings, suspicious variable naming, or dynamic code patterns; absence of obfuscation or secrets in benign cases.",
  "analysis": "The code is generally benign with typical data handling and network operations. Suspicious features like eval/exec are present in some reports but are not confirmed malicious. Reports lacking code are marked as low risk. The main concern is the presence of eval/exec, which warrants a higher malware suspicion score. Scores are adjusted accordingly to reflect potential risks while avoiding false positives.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign; however, the presence of eval/exec in some reports justifies increasing the malware suspicion score slightly. Overall, the dependency shows low to moderate risk, with careful attention needed for dynamic code execution features.",
