  "purpose": "Assessment of obfuscated module imports for potential malicious behavior or security risks in a Python package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules with obfuscated or random names.",
  "sinks": "Potential execution points if imported modules contain malicious code; data flows within imported modules.",
  "flows": "Import statements serve as source points; malicious code within modules could act as sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated module names with no visible code activity; absence of external inputs or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with obfuscated module names, which raises suspicion but does not demonstrate malicious activity. The obfuscation could be benign or used to conceal malicious modules. Malware scores are low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting no direct evidence of malicious behavior. Obfuscation scores are high (~0.7), justified by naming patterns. Risk scores are low (~0.2), indicating moderate concern primarily due to obfuscation. Given the lack of concrete malicious activity, scores should be adjusted to reflect minimal suspicion: malware around 0.1, obfuscated around 0.7, and risk around 0.2. Further analysis of the imported modules is necessary to confirm their safety.",
  "conclusion": "The import statements with obfuscated names are suspicious but do not contain evidence of malicious behavior. Scores should be adjusted to low malware and risk levels, with obfuscation remaining high. Further investigation into the actual contents of these modules is recommended to definitively assess security risks.",
