{
  "purpose": "Import various modules or functions from local package files, likely for code formatting, linting, and static analysis tools.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local package modules",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or external communication",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink pathways present in import statements",
  "anomalies": "Imports consist solely of obfuscated module and function names, which may indicate an attempt to hide purpose or origin. No actual malicious behavior is visible within these import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains import statements of seemingly randomly named modules and functions, with no other logic, data handling, or external communication. There are no signs of input reading, data leakage, or malicious operations. The obfuscated naming could be benign or malicious, but without further code, it is difficult to determine intent. No suspicious behaviors such as network activity, file modifications, or embedded malicious code are evident.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided import statements alone, there is no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. The obfuscated names could be benign or serve as a form of concealment, but without additional code, no malicious behavior can be confirmed.",
