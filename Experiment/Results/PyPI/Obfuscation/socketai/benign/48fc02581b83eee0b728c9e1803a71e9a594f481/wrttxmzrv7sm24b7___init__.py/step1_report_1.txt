{
  "purpose": "The code imports multiple modules from the current package, likely for various code formatting, linting, or checking functionalities.",
  "sources": "Module import statements at the beginning of the code; no external input sources identified.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as network operations, file writes, or system calls are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks, as the code only contains import statements.",
  "anomalies": "All imported module names appear to be obfuscated or randomly generated strings, which is unusual and may indicate malicious intent. No other suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code exclusively consists of import statements importing modules with seemingly random or obfuscated names. These could be legitimate, but the naming pattern suggests potential obfuscation. There are no visible external inputs, network operations, or other suspicious activities. Without additional code, it's impossible to determine if these modules perform malicious actions internally. The lack of context and the suspicious naming convention warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself is limited to module imports with obfuscated names, raising suspicion about possible obfuscation or concealment of malicious modules. However, no direct malicious activity or malicious code is evident in these import statements alone.",
