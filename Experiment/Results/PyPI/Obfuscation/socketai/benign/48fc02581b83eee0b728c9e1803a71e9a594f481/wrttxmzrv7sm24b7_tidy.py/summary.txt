  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate plugin for code formatting, with obfuscation that reduces readability but does not imply malicious intent. It performs standard external command invocation without malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, the obfuscation score is high (~0.8), and the security risk score is low (~0.2), aligning with the observed benign behavior."
