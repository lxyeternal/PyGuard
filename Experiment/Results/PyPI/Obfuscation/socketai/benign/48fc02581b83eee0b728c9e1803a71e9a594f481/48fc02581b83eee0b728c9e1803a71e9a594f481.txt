      "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names and dynamic version loading via exec(). No active malicious activity is evident, but the use of exec() poses a security risk if the version file is compromised. Obfuscation raises some concern but does not confirm malicious intent."

The primary security concern is reliance on trusted configuration for external command execution. No evidence of malware, backdoors, or data exfiltration is present. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with this analysis, and no modifications are necessary."

      "conclusion": "The import statements with obfuscated names are suspicious but do not contain evidence of malicious behavior. Scores should be adjusted to low malware and risk levels, with obfuscation remaining high. Further investigation into the actual contents of these modules is recommended to definitively assess security risks."

The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not indicate malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior."

It performs standard external command invocation without malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, the obfuscation score is high (~0.8), and the security risk score is low (~0.2), aligning with the observed benign behavior."

The security risk is low, primarily due to external command execution, which is standard for such tools."

No malware or sabotage is detected. The scores assigned are consistent with the analysis, with malware score at 0, obfuscation at approximately 0.75, and low security risk. The external command execution is typical for formatters but should be used with trusted inputs in practice."

The high obfuscation score reflects the difficulty in understanding the code but does not indicate malicious intent. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score is zero."
