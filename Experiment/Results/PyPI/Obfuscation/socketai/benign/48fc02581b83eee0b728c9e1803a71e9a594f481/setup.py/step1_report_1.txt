  "purpose": "Set up configuration for a Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading the content of '_version.py' to execute and obtain version info.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data output points present.",
  "flows": "Reading '_version.py' content and executing it to set version info; then passing static metadata to setup().",
  "anomalies": "Use of variable names with obfuscated or non-descriptive names; execution of external file content via exec() which can be risky if the file is malicious or tampered with.",
  "analysis": "The code performs package setup using setuptools, dynamically reads version information from a file '_version.py' via exec(), and defines package metadata and dependencies. The use of 'exec()' to run external script content is a potential security concern, especially if the '_version.py' file is compromised or malicious. The variable names are obfuscated, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. There are no suspicious network connections, hardcoded credentials, or other malicious actions evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily sets up package configuration with a potentially risky use of 'exec()' to load version info, which could be exploited if the '_version.py' file is maliciously altered. No other malicious behavior or malware indicators are detected.",
