  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code sets up a plugin for a linting tool that runs 'shellcheck' on shell scripts (.bash, .sh). No malicious behavior or vulnerabilities are evident. The process_utils.run executes external commands in a typical manner.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2. The low risk score seems appropriate given the benign analysis.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent. The low malware and risk scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the obfuscated class/method names. No malicious behavior detected; the code runs 'shellcheck' on scripts based on extension filtering.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0.2, risk=0.1. The malware score is zero, which aligns with the analysis. The obfuscation is noted but not malicious.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; the obfuscation is suspicious but not malicious. The low risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code runs 'shellcheck' on scripts, with obfuscated naming. No malicious activity or vulnerabilities detected. The obfuscation is high (0.7), but this is considered suspicious rather than malicious.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0.7, risk=0.2. The malware score remains zero, which is appropriate.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis correctly notes that obfuscation alone does not imply malicious intent. The low malware score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code filters files by extension and runs 'shellcheck'. No malicious activity or backdoors are identified. Obfuscation is low (0.2), and the overall behavior is standard.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0.2, risk=0.2. These are reasonable.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; no issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a plugin that runs 'shellcheck' on shell scripts, with obfuscated naming. No malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or network activity. The obfuscation is superficial.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0.8, risk=0.2. The malware score is zero, which is justified.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis correctly states that obfuscation does not imply malicious intent, and the overall risk is low.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0.0, which aligns with the code's behavior—it's a standard plugin executing an external linter. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are evident.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Varies from 0.2 to 0.8. The code's class and method names are indeed obfuscated or auto-generated, but this alone does not imply malicious intent. The scores seem reasonable, though a higher score (around 0.7) is justified given the obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk Score:** All reports are low (around 0.1-0.2), which is appropriate given the benign functionality.\n\n### **Final Expert Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0.0** — No evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0.6** — The code is significantly obfuscated but not malicious.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.2** — Low risk, standard external command execution.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and reasonable. The code appears to be a legitimate plugin for shell script linting, with obfuscation being the only suspicious aspect but not indicative of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- No malicious activity detected.  \n- Obfuscation is notable but not malicious.  \n- Overall security risk remains low.",
