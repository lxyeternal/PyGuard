  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate plugin for code formatting/linting, with obfuscated naming but no malicious activity. The primary security concern is reliance on trusted configuration for external command execution. No evidence of malware, backdoors, or data exfiltration is present. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with this analysis, and no modifications are necessary."
