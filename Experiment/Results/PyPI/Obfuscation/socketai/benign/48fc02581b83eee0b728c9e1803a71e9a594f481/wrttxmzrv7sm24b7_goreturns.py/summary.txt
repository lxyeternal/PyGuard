  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a benign plugin wrapping 'goreturns' for Go source formatting. Obfuscation is present but not indicative of malicious activity. No malware or sabotage is detected. The scores assigned are consistent with the analysis, with malware score at 0, obfuscation at approximately 0.75, and low security risk. The external command execution is typical for formatters but should be used with trusted inputs in practice."
