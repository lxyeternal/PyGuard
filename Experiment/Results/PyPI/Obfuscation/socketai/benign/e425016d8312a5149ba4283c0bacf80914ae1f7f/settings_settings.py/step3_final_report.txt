{
  "purpose": "The code is a Django settings configuration module, primarily defining installed apps, middleware, database settings, and other configuration parameters. It appears to be a standard setup with no dynamic or malicious code.",
  "sources": "The code reads the file path for the project directory, assigns a hardcoded secret key string, and defines static configuration lists and dictionaries. No external input sources or untrusted data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data; the code does not perform any network operations, data processing, or system modifications based on external input.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted data; the code is static configuration without runtime data processing or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The only notable anomaly is the presence of a hardcoded secret key string ('uzABiJAiOiSGNisuBJbIMcKUafgLSKpe') and an unused random string variable, which could be considered a minor obfuscation or leftover artifact. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation techniques are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Django settings module containing app definitions, middleware, database configuration, password validators, and static file paths. The secret key is hardcoded, which is insecure for production but not malicious. The random string appears unused and benign. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated malicious code is present. The code's structure and content do not suggest malicious intent or supply chain sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Django configuration with a security concern due to the hardcoded secret key. There is no evidence of malware, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. The primary risk stems from insecure secret management practices, not active malicious activity.",
