{
  "purpose": "The code appears to configure Django project settings, including paths, security options, middleware, installed apps, templates, database, and internationalization.",
  "sources": "Reads from environment (file path), hardcoded strings (e.g., secret key, language, timezone), and default Django settings.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leakage or misconfiguration could occur if secrets or sensitive info are exposed via logs or environment variables, but no explicit sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from hardcoded configurations and environment-derived paths into Django settings without external input flows.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a hardcoded secret key ('uzABiJAiOiSGNisuBJbIMcKUafgLSKpe') which is a security risk; no user input or dynamic data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly sets up Django configuration parameters. The secret key is hardcoded, which is insecure. No user input handling, external network access, or cryptographic operations are evident. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, no suspicious dynamic code execution, and no malicious actions detected. The only concern is the insecure secret key and static configuration data.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard Django settings with a critical security concern due to the hardcoded secret key. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration activities. Overall, it appears to be benign but insecure due to configuration practices.",
