  "purpose": "Configuration and setup for a Django project, including paths, middleware, installed apps, database, and security settings.",
  "sources": "Variables assigned from environment or hardcoded values, such as os.path.dirname, string literals, and boolean flags.",
  "sinks": "File path operations, potential use of environment variables or external data is not explicitly shown, no network or data leaks directly visible.",
  "flows": "Initialization of project settings from hardcoded or derived values, no dynamic or untrusted data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "The string 'uzABiJAiOiSGNisuBJbIMcKUafgLSKpe' appears as a random, unused string; no evidence of code injection, backdoors, or malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a static configuration for a Django application, with standard settings such as middleware, installed apps, database configuration, and security flags. No dynamic input handling, no network activity, no obfuscated or suspicious code constructs. The random string does not seem to serve any functional purpose, indicating possible leftover or placeholder data. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears safe and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Django settings module with no malicious or suspicious content. It is primarily static configuration data, with no signs of malware, data leaks, or supply chain attacks.",
