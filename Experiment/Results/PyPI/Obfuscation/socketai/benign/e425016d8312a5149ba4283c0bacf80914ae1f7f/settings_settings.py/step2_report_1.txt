  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the original code and considering the security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard Django settings configuration with no suspicious behavior. The random string is unused and benign.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the code as benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0.1 — reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights the hardcoded secret key ('uzABiJAiOiSGNisuBJbIMcKUafgLSKpe') as a security concern.\n- **Analysis:** The secret key is indeed hardcoded, which is insecure for production but not malicious per se.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.3 — aligns with the concern about insecure secret management.\n- **Justification:** The key's presence is a security flaw, but it doesn't constitute malware or malicious activity.\n- **Verdict:** The risk score is appropriate; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to report 2, emphasizes the hardcoded secret key and standard Django setup.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes the insecure practice but finds no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2 — consistent.\n- **Verdict:** Acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates the static nature of the configuration, unused random string, and no malicious activity.\n- **Analysis:** Accurate. The string appears to be a placeholder or leftover, not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.1 — appropriate.\n- **Verdict:** Sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, notes the hardcoded secret key as a security concern.\n- **Analysis:** Correct. No evidence of malware or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.3 — reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code is purely configuration with no network activity, code execution, or obfuscation.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The only potential obfuscation is the random string 'uzABiJAiOiSGNisuBJbIMcKUafgLSKpe', which is unused and appears benign.\n- **Risk Score:** The main concern across reports is the hardcoded secret key, which is a security best practice violation but not malware.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at **0**; no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should stay low, around **0.1**, due to the unused random string which does not indicate obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the insecure secret key, a **moderate risk score of around 0.3** is justified, reflecting a security misconfiguration but not active malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Estimated Score |\n|----------------|------------------------|\n| Malware        | **0**                |\n| Obfuscated     | **0.1**              |\n| Security Risk  | **0.3**              |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard Django configuration with a security concern regarding the hardcoded secret key. No malware or malicious activity is present. The risk is primarily due to insecure configuration practices.",
