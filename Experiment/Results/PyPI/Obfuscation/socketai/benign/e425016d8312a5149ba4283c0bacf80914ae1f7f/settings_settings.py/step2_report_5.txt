  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** The code is standard Django configuration; the random string is unused; no suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — reasonable, given no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.1 — minimal obfuscation, mainly a random string.\n- **Assessment:** No issues found; the report's conclusion appears accurate.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's assessment is sound. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** The secret key is hardcoded, which is a security concern; no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Risk score:** 0.3 — justified due to insecure secret key.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation, just a random string assigned.\n- **Assessment:** The only concern is the hardcoded secret key, which the report correctly highlights.\n\n**Verdict:** The scoring is appropriate. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 2; hardcoded secret key, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — acceptable, considering the insecure secret key but no malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies the security concern but confirms benign behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate assessment. No change necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** Static configuration, random unused string, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — reasonable.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Assessment:** No issues.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** Hardcoded secret key, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — matches the analysis.\n- **Risk score:** 0.3 — justified due to the insecure secret key.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly highlights the security concern but finds no malicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** Slightly above 0 only for the random string, which is benign.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly elevated where secret keys are hardcoded, which is a common security concern but not malicious.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** ~0.1, reflecting the presence of a random string but no obfuscation techniques.\n- **Risk score:** For production environments, hardcoded secrets are a security risk; thus, a score of 0.2–0.3 is justified.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n**Malware:** 0 — no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n\n**Obfuscated:** 0.1 — minimal, benign random string.\n\n**Risk:** 0.2 — due to hardcoded secret keys, which is a security concern but not an active threat.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent, and their scoring aligns with the code's nature. The code is primarily static configuration with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The main concern is insecure secret management, which is a common security best practice violation but not an active threat in this context.",
