  "purpose": "Configuration setup for a Django project, including paths, secret keys, middleware, installed apps, database settings, and other settings.",
  "sources": "The secret key string, environment variables (if any), and any data read from environment or external sources are not explicitly read or used beyond static assignments.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data is written to external systems or exposed in insecure ways.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flow present; the code only assigns static values and constructs configuration dictionaries.",
  "anomalies": "The secret key appears hardcoded as a seemingly random string, which could be a security concern if this is a production environment; however, it's common in development settings. No indication of malicious code or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static configuration parameters for a Django application, including installed apps, middleware, database configuration, and other settings. The secret key is hardcoded, which is insecure for production but not malicious per se. No code reads untrusted input, nor does it write data externally. The code does not contain obfuscated or suspicious constructs. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Django configuration setup with no evidence of malicious intent or malware. The main concern is the hardcoded secret key, which could be problematic in production but does not indicate malicious activity. Overall, the code appears benign.",
