{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a Django project settings module, configuring application directories, secret keys, middleware, installed apps, database settings, and other configuration options.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (os.path, os.path.dirname, os.path.join), hardcoded strings for secret key and other settings.",
  "sinks": "Potential data exposure through hardcoded secret key and database path; use of environment variables is not evident, which might lead to secret leakage if code is shared.",
  "flows": "The secret key, database path, and other configuration parameters flow into the Django settings, but no external or untrusted data sources are present that could influence these values.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a hardcoded secret key ('uzABiJAiOiSGNisuBJbIMcKUafgLSKpe')—a significant security concern; no dynamic input validation or sanitization observed; no suspicious network activity or code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a static configuration script for a Django project. The only notable security concern is the hardcoded secret key, which can lead to security risks if exposed. There is no evidence of malicious code, external data influence, or suspicious behavior. No obfuscation, malware, or backdoors are evident. Overall, the code is straightforward configuration with a single security best practice violation.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Django settings file with a security concern due to a hardcoded secret key. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malware. The code is primarily configuration data with minimal risk aside from the hardcoded secret.",
