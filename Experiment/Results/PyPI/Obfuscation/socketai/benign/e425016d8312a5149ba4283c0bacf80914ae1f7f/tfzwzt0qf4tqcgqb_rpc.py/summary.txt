  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate RabbitMQ RPC system with moderate obfuscation. No evidence of malware or malicious intent is present. The primary risk relates to dynamic function execution if 'methods' is externally influenced. Overall, the security risk is low, and the malware score is 0."
