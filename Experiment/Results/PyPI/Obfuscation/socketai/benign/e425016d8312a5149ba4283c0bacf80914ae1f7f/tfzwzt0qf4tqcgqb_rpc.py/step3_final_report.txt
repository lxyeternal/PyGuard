  "purpose": "Implements a RabbitMQ RPC messaging pattern with dynamic function invocation and message handling.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters, environment settings, message properties, and message content.",
  "sinks": "Publishes messages to RabbitMQ, processes incoming data, and logs information.",
  "flows": "Data flows from message content and function parameters through JSON serialization/deserialization into function calls and message publishing.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic function invocation via 'methods' dictionary; variable and class names are obfuscated; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard RabbitMQ RPC implementation with dynamic function invocation. No hardcoded credentials or malicious payloads are present. Obfuscation is superficial, primarily variable naming. The main security concern is if 'methods' can be externally controlled, which could lead to code injection. No signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity are observed. The code's structure and behavior align with legitimate message handling patterns. The dynamic invocation warrants cautious review of 'methods' population, but in isolation, no malicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate RabbitMQ RPC system with moderate obfuscation. No evidence of malware or malicious intent is present. The primary risk relates to dynamic function execution if 'methods' is externally influenced. Overall, the security risk is low, and the malware score is 0.",
