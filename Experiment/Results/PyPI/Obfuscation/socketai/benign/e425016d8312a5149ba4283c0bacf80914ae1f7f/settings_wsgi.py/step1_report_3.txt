  "flows": "Environment variable setting influences Django's configuration, which affects the application behavior",
  "anomalies": "Use of an obfuscated variable name for the WSGI application object; no other unusual code behavior",
  "analysis": "The code sets a Django environment variable 'DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE' to 'settings.settings', then calls 'get_wsgi_application()' to create a WSGI application instance, stored in an obfuscated variable name. The variable name appears intentionally obscure but does not impact functionality. No malicious code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior detected. The code performs standard Django initialization. No data leaks, code injections, or malicious network activities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django application initialization snippet with an obfuscated variable name. There is no malicious intent or suspicious activity detected.",
