  "anomalies": "Presence of a seemingly random variable name 'MjiAHOhGsptZMzhcJjogggwjJRqNxJXW', which appears to be obfuscated or nonsensical.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a default environment variable for Django settings and then initializes the WSGI application. The variable name assigned to the application object is unusual and looks like obfuscated or auto-generated, which could be suspicious. However, there are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or network activity. The code's purpose is standard for deploying Django applications. The random variable name could be a form of simple obfuscation but doesn't inherently indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard Django application initialization with an unusual variable name. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident based solely on this code snippet. The obfuscated variable name might be intentional or accidental but does not suggest malicious activity.",
