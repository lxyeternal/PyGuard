  "flows": "Environment variable setting -> get_wsgi_application() invocation.",
  "anomalies": "The variable name 'MjiAHOhGsptZMzhcJjogggwjJRqNxJXW' is unusual and appears obfuscated or randomly generated; no other suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a default environment variable for Django settings and initializes the WSGI application. The variable name used to store the application is obfuscated, which is atypical for clean code but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials, no network activity, no data leakage, and no malicious functions are present. The code's intent aligns with standard Django deployment setup. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard Django application initialization with an obfuscated variable name. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks based on this fragment.",
