  "purpose": "Initialize the Django WSGI application by setting the environment variable for Django settings.",
  "sources": "os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'settings.settings')",
  "sinks": "get_wsgi_application()",
  "flows": "os.environ.setdefault() sets environment variable -> get_wsgi_application() loads settings from environment variable",
  "anomalies": "The variable name 'MjiAHOhGsptZMzhcJjogggwjJRqNxJXW' appears random and unused; no other suspicious code or backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The code sets the environment variable 'DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE' to 'settings.settings', which is typical for Django applications. It then initializes the WSGI application object. The variable name assigned to the application object appears obfuscated or randomly generated but does not affect functionality. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious network behavior are present. The code is minimal and typical for Django deployment.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard Django WSGI application initialization with an unusual variable name that seems obfuscated but is not malicious. No signs of malware or security risks are detected.",
