  "flows": "Setting environment variable -> calling get_wsgi_application() -> application object creation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a highly obfuscated or nonsensical variable name for the application object.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical Django deployment setup with no malicious code, network activity, or data leaks. The only anomaly is the obfuscated variable name, which does not affect functionality but reduces readability. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present. The variable name's obfuscation could be accidental or stylistic, not necessarily malicious. Malware score is 0, as there is no evidence of malicious intent. The obfuscation score is moderate (~0.7) due to the nonsensical variable name, but this alone does not imply malicious activity. Security risk remains very low (~0.2). Confidence in this assessment is high (0.9), given the straightforward nature of the code and lack of suspicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign Django WSGI initialization with an obfuscated variable name. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation is suspicious but not malicious, and the overall security risk is minimal. The current scores accurately reflect this assessment.",
