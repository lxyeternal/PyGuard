  "conclusion": "The script is a benign setup configuration with superficial obfuscation. No evidence of malicious behavior or security risks is detected. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not elevate the threat level. The malware score should remain at 0, obfuscated at 0.7, and security risk at 0.2, reflecting the obfuscation but absence of malicious activity."
