      "conclusion": "The script is a benign setup configuration with superficial obfuscation. No evidence of malicious behavior or security risks is detected. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not elevate the threat level. The malware score should remain at 0, obfuscated at 0.7, and security risk at 0.2, reflecting the obfuscation but absence of malicious activity."

The obfuscation is suspicious but not malicious, and the overall security risk is minimal. The current scores accurately reflect this assessment."

The primary risk relates to dynamic function execution if 'methods' is externally influenced. Overall, the security risk is low, and the malware score is 0."
