  "sources": "There are no identifiable sources or data input points within the code.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects, as no operations are performed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink is present due to the absence of code logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no executable statements, functions, or logic; the entire script is empty or non-functional.",
  "analysis": "A thorough review shows that the provided code is effectively empty or consists of only whitespace and comments. There are no input sources, no processing, and no output or data handling. Without code logic, there are no potential security vulnerabilities, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation indicators. The code does not perform any actions and appears to serve as a placeholder.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is empty or non-functional, with no malicious intent or security concerns. It is essentially inert, providing no attack surface or suspicious activity.",
