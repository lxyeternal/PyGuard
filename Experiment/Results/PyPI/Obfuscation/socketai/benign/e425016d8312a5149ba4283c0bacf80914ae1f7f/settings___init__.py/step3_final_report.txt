  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, files, user input; network communication endpoints.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, file writes, eval()/exec() execution points, external URL connections.",
  "flows": "Input sources feed into processing functions, which may invoke eval()/exec() or send data over network endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated code, dynamic eval/exec usage, suspicious network activity, hardcoded URLs or credentials.",
  "analysis": "The code's purpose was assessed based on patterns of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and network activity. Reports indicating obfuscation and eval()/exec() usage were flagged as suspicious, with higher malware and risk scores. Benign scripts without obfuscation or malicious signatures received low scores. The scores across reports are consistent with their described behaviors, with higher suspicion justified for obfuscated and dynamic code. No evidence of malicious payloads or backdoors was found in the provided snippets. Overall, the scoring aligns with the analysis, with no adjustments necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency exhibits benign behavior in most cases, with some reports showing obfuscation and dynamic code execution that warrant higher suspicion. The scores are justified and consistent with the code behaviors described. No further action required unless more context reveals malicious payloads.",
