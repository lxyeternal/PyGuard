  "conclusion": "The primary issue is a variable mismatch causing potential runtime errors, with no evidence of malicious activity. The obfuscation of variable names raises moderate concern but does not indicate malware. The code is a simple sensor display with a bug affecting stability. The malware score is low (near 0), obfuscation moderate (~0.3-0.4), and overall security risk low (~0.2-0.3)."
