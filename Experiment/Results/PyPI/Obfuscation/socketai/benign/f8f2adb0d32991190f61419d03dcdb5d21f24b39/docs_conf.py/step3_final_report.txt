  "purpose": "Configuration setup for Sphinx documentation, including project metadata, theme settings, static files, and references.",
  "sources": "Standard library modules (os, sys, datetime), hardcoded strings, and configuration variables.",
  "sinks": "No data output, network activity, or external data processing observed.",
  "flows": "Static data assignments; no untrusted data flow or external input handling.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, which are unusual but not inherently malicious; no suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static configuration script for documentation generation, with no network activity, data leaks, or code execution involving external inputs. Variable obfuscation appears stylistic or accidental. No malicious patterns such as hardcoded secrets, credential handling, or malicious commands are present. The code's purpose is benign, serving as a setup for Sphinx documentation with project info, theme, static files, and references.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated configuration script for documentation purposes. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation is stylistic rather than malicious, and the overall security risk is negligible.",
