{
  "purpose": "To read proximity and ambient light data from an Adafruit VCNL4010 sensor connected via I2C.",
  "sources": "I2C bus initialized with board.I2C(), sensor object creation using adafruit_vcnl4010, reading sensor proximity and ambient light data within the loop.",
  "sinks": "The sensor data is printed to the console; no other sinks or data transmission is present.",
  "flows": "Data read from sensor (sources) flows directly to print statements (sinks).",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are obfuscated (e.g., ytwMmUCLxBryrYUvhUsOXepESsXqgXFq, JKyFIWPzfRCDGyIqfQJNGIWlbxoeeySB), which is suspicious but not malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. No network communication or system manipulation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes an I2C connection, creates a sensor object, and enters an infinite loop where it reads proximity and ambient light data from the sensor, printing the results every second. Variable names are obfuscated, which may suggest an attempt to conceal intent, but the code itself only interacts with hardware sensors and outputs data locally. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads. No external network or file operations are involved.",
  "conclusion": "The script functions as a sensor data reader with obfuscated variable names but no malicious intent or security risks identified. It appears to be a legitimate sensor data acquisition script with minimal risk.",
