{
  "purpose": "The code configures Redis connection strings based on environment variables, retrieves server info asynchronously, and conditionally skips tests based on Redis version compatibility.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for Redis nodes, cluster mode, features, and version; functions that generate connection URIs and retrieve Redis server info.",
  "sinks": "Redis INFO command execution, test skipping logic based on version comparison.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence connection parameters; info commands fetch server data; version info is cached globally; tests are skipped if version requirements are not met.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated variable names, dynamic execution with asyncio.run(), global variable caching Redis version info, and async functions within test fixtures.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a testing utility for Redis clusters, involving environment-driven configuration, info retrieval, and test skipping based on version checks. No malicious commands, backdoors, or data exfiltration are evident. Obfuscation and dynamic code execution are notable but common in complex test setups, not necessarily malicious. The global cache for Redis version info is unusual but not harmful. Overall, the code appears legitimate, with low security risk, though obfuscation warrants cautious review.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Redis testing setup with obfuscation and dynamic features that do not indicate malicious intent. No supply chain sabotage or malware is detected. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is moderate (around 0.7), and overall security risk remains low (~0.3).",
