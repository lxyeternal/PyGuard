{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script designed to perform data processing and output results. No explicit purpose indicating malicious activity is evident.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from environment variables, configuration files, or function parameters. No external data sources or network inputs are apparent.",
  "sinks": "Output is directed to standard output, log files, or return values. No unsafe file writes or network transmissions are explicitly shown.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions to output or return statements. No unusual source-to-sink data paths are identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials, suspicious dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code observed. No unusual variables or code constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical data processing routines, utilizing common libraries and patterns. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, file tampering, or credential theft. The structure is straightforward and adheres to normal coding practices. No suspicious code segments, backdoors, or malicious intent are evident upon detailed review.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no indications of malware or security risks. It functions as a standard data processing script without malicious behavior. Confidence in this assessment is high.",
