  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is to perform a specific function or task, but it is not explicitly clear without seeing the code. It appears to be a standard Python script or package component.",
  "sources": "Input data from user inputs, environment variables, network requests, or file reads (exact sources cannot be identified without code).",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive operations such as network connections, file writes, system calls, or executing dynamic code, which could be used to leak data or execute malicious commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (user input, environment variables) to sinks (network, files, system commands). Specific flow paths cannot be detailed without the actual code.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs identified from the provided information. No obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The review process indicates the code does not contain visible signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks based on the provided fragment. The absence of code snippets limits detailed source-sink flow analysis, but no malicious patterns or anomalies are evident.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available information, the code appears benign with no detectable malicious behavior or security risks. Due to lack of specific code details, confidence in this conclusion is moderate.",
  "confidence": 0.6,
  "obfuscated": 0,
