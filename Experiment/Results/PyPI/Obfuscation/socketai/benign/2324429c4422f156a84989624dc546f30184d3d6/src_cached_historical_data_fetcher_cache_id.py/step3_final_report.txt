  "purpose": "A utility class for managing pandas Index objects, providing methods for updating, difference calculation, and property access, with obfuscated method names.",
  "sources": "Reads input sequences for index updates and difference calculations.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network calls, or data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "Input sequences flow into methods that update or compute differences of internal Index state.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated method names, but no malicious code or suspicious patterns; no hardcoded secrets or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a generic class inheriting from pandas Index-based classes, managing an internal set of indices with methods for union and difference, and properties returning None. No external I/O, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. Method names are obfuscated but their logic is straightforward. No signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or security vulnerabilities are evident. Obfuscation may be for concealment but does not imply malicious intent. The class appears to be a benign data utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign utility class for pandas Index management with obfuscated method names. No malicious activity or security risks are detected. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is moderate (~0.6), and overall security risk is very low (~0.1).",
