{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an internal module setup, importing obfuscated internal components and defining the public API via __all__.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.base, .chunk, .id) with obfuscated names.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, network operations, or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "Import statements load internal symbols; no data flows or external interactions are evident.",
  "anomalies": "Use of non-descriptive, obfuscated import and class names; no additional suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module export setup with obfuscated internal identifiers. No malicious payloads, network activity, or data leaks are present. The obfuscation is notable but not inherently malicious; it could be for internal concealment or stylistic reasons. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, low security risk, high obfuscation) are consistent with the evidence. The confidence levels are appropriate given the limited code snippet. No active threats or vulnerabilities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with obfuscation being the only suspicious aspect, which alone does not imply malicious intent. The current security assessment scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary based on this snippet.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0.75,
