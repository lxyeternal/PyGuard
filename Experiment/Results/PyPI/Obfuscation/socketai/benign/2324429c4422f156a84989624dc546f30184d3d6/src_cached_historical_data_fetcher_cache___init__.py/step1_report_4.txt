{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that imports specific classes or functions from local submodules and defines an export list for use elsewhere.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .base, .chunk, .id",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or outputs; only defining import and export structure",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only performs imports and exports",
  "anomalies": "All imported names are obfuscated (non-descriptive), which could be an attempt to hide functionality. No actual usage or behavior shown beyond import/export.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing obfuscated names from internal modules and defining an export list. No suspicious functions, no data handling, no external network activity, and no use of environment variables or secrets. The obfuscated names may suggest attempts to hide implementation details, but without additional context, this is not necessarily malicious. The code itself does not perform any actions beyond imports and exports.",
  "conclusion": "This fragment is a simple import-export module with obfuscated internal names. There are no evident malicious behaviors or security issues within this snippet. The obfuscation might be intended to conceal internal workings but does not inherently imply malicious intent.",
