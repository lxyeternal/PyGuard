  "anomalies": "No anomalies can be detected without the code content. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious patterns, or obfuscated code are evident from the provided data.",
  "analysis": "Due to lack of actual code, a step-by-step analysis cannot be performed. The review is based on the absence of visible code, which makes it impossible to identify suspicious behaviors, data leaks, or malicious intent.",
