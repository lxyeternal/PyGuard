  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code patterns, obfuscation, and suspicious activities.",
  "sources": "Code snippets, data input points, environment variables, network connections, dynamic code execution points.",
  "sinks": "Data leaks, network transmissions, file modifications, system commands, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "From sources such as input or environment variables to sinks like network or file operations, possibly via dynamic execution or data processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "Signs of obfuscation (e.g., complex logic, eval/exec usage), hardcoded secrets, unusual data flows, ambiguous or convoluted code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets are mostly benign, with minimal suspicious patterns. Report 4 shows signs of obfuscation and ambiguous data flows, warranting a higher suspicion level. Other reports lack evidence of malicious activity. The scores are generally consistent with the descriptions; however, the malware score for Report 4 should be increased from 0.2 to approximately 0.5 to better reflect the obfuscation signs. Confidence levels are appropriate given the limited code context. No significant obfuscation or malware is detected in other reports.",
  "conclusion": "Overall, the dependency appears benign with low security risk. The primary concern is obfuscation in Report 4, which warrants a moderate increase in malware suspicion. Scores are adjusted accordingly to reflect this, maintaining a cautious but justified security posture.",
