  "obfuscated": 0.6,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious intent due to unsafe command execution, directory manipulations, permission modifications, and obfuscation. While no explicit payloads are observed, the pattern of behavior warrants caution. The overall security risk is high, and the potential for exploitation is significant. Input validation, sanitization, and refactoring to use safer subprocess modules are strongly recommended before deployment."
