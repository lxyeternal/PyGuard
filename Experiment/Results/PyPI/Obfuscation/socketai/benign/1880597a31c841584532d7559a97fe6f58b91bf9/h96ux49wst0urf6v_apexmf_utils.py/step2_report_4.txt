  "review": "Let's analyze the provided information step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Reported Issues in the Code:**\n   - The original code snippet appears to be a function definition with docstrings, describing parameters and return values.\n   - The reports contain only \"Empty response\" errors with no additional details.\n   - Since no specific issues or anomalies are described in the reports, there is no evidence that the code contains bugs, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior based solely on the reports.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning:**\n   - The reports do not provide any reasoning, analysis, or evidence—only empty responses.\n   - Without substantive content, there are no logical flaws or mistakes to identify in the reports themselves.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue & Recommendations:**\n   - The reports do not specify any scores, so there is no basis for evaluation or adjustment.\n   - Given the lack of detail, assigning any risk or malware scores would be arbitrary and unjustified.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since no issues are identified, and the reports contain no information about vulnerabilities or malicious activity, a high risk score cannot be justified.\n   - The absence of evidence suggests a low or negligible risk.\n\n5. **Malware Score Considerations:**\n   - No evidence of malicious activity is present.\n   - The code snippet appears to be a standard function with descriptive docstrings, not indicative of malware.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make any claims or assumptions; they only show empty responses.\n   - Therefore, no assumptions are being challenged.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Report:**\n   - Since no scores are provided, this point is moot.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Code Review:** The code appears syntactically correct and standard for a Python function with docstrings. No malicious or vulnerable patterns are evident.\n- **Report Validity:** The reports are empty and do not provide any actionable information.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Based on the available data, both scores should be very low, close to zero, indicating minimal or no risk.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **For the scores:** Set malware and obfuscated scores to 0.0.\n- **For the overall risk score:** Also 0.0, given the lack of evidence.\n- **For the report process:** Ensure that future reports include detailed analysis, code snippets, or evidence to facilitate meaningful review.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Recommended Value | Justification                                              |\n|------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware Score    | 0.0                 | No malicious activity detected; reports are empty.         |\n| Obfuscated Score | 0.0                 | Code appears straightforward; no obfuscation observed.     |\n| Risk Score       | 0.0                 | No evidence of vulnerabilities or threats.                 |\n\nThis step-by-step reasoning confirms that the incident reports do not indicate any actual issues.",
