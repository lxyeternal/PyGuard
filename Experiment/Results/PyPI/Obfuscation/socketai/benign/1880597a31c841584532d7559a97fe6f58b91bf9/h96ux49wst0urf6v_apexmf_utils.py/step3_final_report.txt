  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks, based on provided code snippets and reports.",
  "sources": "Function argument definitions and docstrings; no actual data input or external data sources identified.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output operations observed; the code is primarily descriptive.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths since implementation code is absent; only parameter descriptions are present.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names in argument descriptions; no executable code or suspicious patterns identified.",
  "analysis": "The provided code snippet is a function header with descriptive docstrings but lacks implementation. The reports are empty, containing only 'Empty response' errors, indicating no detailed analysis or findings. Without actual code execution or concrete findings, no vulnerabilities, malicious behaviors, or anomalies can be confirmed. The obfuscated variable names are likely placeholders or non-descriptive identifiers, not evidence of malicious obfuscation. Given the absence of evidence, the code appears benign, and no security issues are apparent from the available data.",
  "conclusion": "The code and reports do not reveal any malicious activity or vulnerabilities. The lack of detailed analysis or actual code limits assessment, but based on current information, the dependency appears safe. Scores for malware, obfuscation, and risk should be set to zero, reflecting no detected threats.",
