  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script defining package metadata, dependencies, and URLs for the 'apexmf' module.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.rst' for long description; uses hardcoded strings for metadata.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network calls, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Reads file -> passes data to setup() function; no dynamic or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names (e.g., EdDkBkZIxegJhpPYJQOsVDipwcDEahhE), but no malicious code or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with intentionally obfuscated variable names. No network activity, code injection, or handling of untrusted input is detected. The obfuscation appears superficial and stylistic, not malicious. All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious behavior, assigning malware scores of 0 and low security risk scores (~0.1). The obfuscation scores are high (~0.7-0.8), justified by variable naming but not indicative of malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads are present. The overall security posture is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with superficial obfuscation. No malicious activity or security risks are detected. The obfuscation does not imply malicious intent, and the supply chain security risk remains very low.",
