{
  "purpose": "This code is for configuring and setting up a Python package named 'apexmf' using setuptools, including reading a README file and specifying package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.rst file from the filesystem",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input or lead to data leaks",
  "flows": "Reads README file -> passes package metadata to setup()",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated-like variable names (e.g., EdDkBkZIxegJhpPYJQOsVDipwcDEahhE) but no malicious intent evident; no hardcoded secrets, no network calls, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious data handling",
  "analysis": "The script primarily imports setup functions, reads a README file for long description, and calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and URLs. Variable names are intentionally obfuscated but no malicious behavior or hidden code is apparent. The code adheres to standard package setup procedures without suspicious patterns or embedded malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with obfuscated variable names but no malicious or security-risk behavior detected. It performs typical package configuration tasks without any suspicious activity.",
