  "purpose": "Documentation for a function related to PEST support visualizations, handling simulation data and observed data for water depth analysis.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: start_date (str), qCBybeiXymMatsjIttdWJnVYYDWoVyJj (list), obd_nams (list), ZpIeNhmseKZlxfpVbhUlUsqfUSnLESAG (str, optional).",
  "sinks": "Return statement outputs a dataframe; no external data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to process data; no external data flows or network activity observed.",
  "anomalies": "The variable names are obfuscated or nonsensical, which might be an attempt to obscure purpose. The duplicated Args and Returns docstrings suggest copy-paste or confusion, but no malicious code or behavior is present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a docstring describing a function's parameters and return values. No executable code, data handling, or external calls are present. The obfuscated variable names could be suspicious, but they appear to be placeholders or corrupted docstring content. No input/output operations, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are evident. The content appears to be standard documentation, not an active or malicious script.",
  "conclusion": "The provided snippet is only a documentation string for a function with no executable code or malicious behavior. The obfuscated variable names and duplicated documentation are suspicious but not inherently malicious. Overall, there's no evidence of malware or security risks within this fragment.",
