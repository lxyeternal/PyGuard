{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a docstring for a function related to PEST support visualizations, providing descriptions of parameters and return values for a simulation or data processing task involving water depth and observed data.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources are shown within this code snippet; it is only a docstring describing expected arguments and outputs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this code snippet; it contains only documentation and no executable code.",
  "flows": "Since this is a docstring with no executable code, there are no source-to-sink data flows.",
  "anomalies": "The docstring contains repeated argument descriptions and inconsistent formatting, such as duplicate 'Args' and 'Returns' sections, which is unusual but not malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are visible.",
  "analysis": "The provided snippet is purely a descriptive comment (docstring) for a function, detailing input arguments and return values. There is no executable code, data processing, or logic that could be malicious. The repetition and inconsistent formatting appear to be careless or redundant documentation rather than an attempt to conceal malicious behavior. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious intent are evident in this text.",
  "conclusion": "This is a non-executable docstring with no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks. It serves solely as documentation for a function related to visualization in a water simulation context.",
