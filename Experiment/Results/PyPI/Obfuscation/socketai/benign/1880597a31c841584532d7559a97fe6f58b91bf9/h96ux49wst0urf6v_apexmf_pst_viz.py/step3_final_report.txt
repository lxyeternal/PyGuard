  "purpose": "Documentation describing a function for processing and visualizing water depth data, including simulated and observed values.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as start_date, grid IDs, observed column names, and optional step size; no actual data reading in the snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external data transmission observed.",
  "flows": "Parameters flow into the function; no data flow or processing shown in the snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated variable names and duplicated docstring sections; no executable code or logic; inconsistent formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet consists solely of documentation with obfuscated variable names, suggesting possible obfuscation or auto-generation. No executable logic, network activity, or malicious commands are present. The high obfuscation score is justified, but without actual code, the malware risk remains minimal. The documentation appears benign, but obfuscation warrants caution. Scores are consistent with the absence of malicious behavior, with low security risk and high obfuscation due to nonsensical variable names.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is only documentation with obfuscated variable names, showing no evidence of malicious activity. The high obfuscation score is justified, but the malware and security risk scores remain low. Further review of actual implementation code is recommended if available.",
