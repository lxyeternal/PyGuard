{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script intended for data processing or application logic, with no clear indication of malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, potentially user input, or configuration files; specific sources are not explicitly shown in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could be network connections, file writing, or system commands if used, but no such actions are clearly present in the visible code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions; without explicit code, specific source-to-sink paths cannot be fully identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are evident. The code uses standard constructs and libraries without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, utilizing common Python patterns for data handling and processing. There are no signs of malicious activities such as network communication with suspicious domains, data exfiltration, or backdoor logic. Usage of third-party libraries appears typical, with no unusual dynamic execution or obfuscation observed. Absence of hardcoded secrets or insecure practices suggests a low likelihood of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indications of malicious behavior or supply chain risks. The code seems to serve its intended purpose without malicious modifications.",
