  "purpose": "Assess supply chain security of the open source Python dependency by analyzing code snippets for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code reading environment variables, network communication, data processing, or no code provided.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, data leaks, environment variable access, or external system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input sources such as environment variables or data inputs to sinks like network calls or data processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "Lack of code or minimal code with no suspicious patterns; no obfuscation or malicious indicators detected.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate minimal or no code, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0) are consistent with the absence of suspicious patterns. Risk scores are conservatively set at 0.2 in some reports, but given the lack of code or activity, they could be lowered to 0. For reports with no code, risk scores should be 0. The confidence levels reflect the limited data but are appropriate. Overall, the assessments are cautious and justified, with no evidence of supply chain threats.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code snippets and reports suggest the dependency is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The current scoring is appropriate, though risk scores could be slightly lowered for reports lacking code. No immediate concerns are identified.",
