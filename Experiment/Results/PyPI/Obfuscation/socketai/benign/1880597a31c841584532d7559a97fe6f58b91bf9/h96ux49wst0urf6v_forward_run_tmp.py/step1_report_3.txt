  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a general utility script or module, but without actual code provided, the specific intent cannot be precisely determined.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly visible due to lack of code; typically, sources could include environment variables, user input functions, file reads, or network requests.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include network connections, file writes, system commands, or environment variable access, but specifics cannot be determined without actual code.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows can be established without code context; analysis cannot proceed meaningfully without the code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns can be identified in the absence of provided code. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are visible.",
  "analysis": "No code was provided for analysis. Therefore, no step-by-step evaluation is possible. Without the code, the review cannot identify sources, sinks, flows, or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "Insufficient data to determine purpose, security risks, or malicious behavior. Cannot assess code security or potential malicious intent without actual code content.",
