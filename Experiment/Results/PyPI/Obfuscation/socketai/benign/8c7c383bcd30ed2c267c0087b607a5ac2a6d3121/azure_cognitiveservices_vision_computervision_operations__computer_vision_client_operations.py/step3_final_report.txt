{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a client SDK for remote image, document, and model analysis via REST API calls, serializing input parameters, handling network requests, and deserializing responses.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration URLs, input parameters (visual features, model versions, language, etc.), and stream data for uploads.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to API endpoints, response deserialization, potential data leaks through network activity, and streaming uploads/downloads.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into serialized API requests; responses flow back into model objects; streams are uploaded/downloaded via network calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no suspicious URLs or payloads; method names are cryptic but typical for SDKs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard SDK pattern for cloud analysis services, involving serialization of parameters, network communication, error handling, and response deserialization. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or secrets are present. Network activity and data handling are consistent with legitimate API client behavior. The obfuscation level is minimal, and the code does not contain any signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign SDK client for external analysis APIs. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected. The low malware score (0), minimal obfuscation (0.1), and low security risk (0.2) are justified based on the analysis.",
