{
  "purpose": "Extend the module search path for package resource discovery",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and uses 'extend_path' to modify __path__",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows leading to data leaks or malicious actions are present",
  "flows": "The code modifies __path__ using 'extend_path', which influences package resource loading but does not process untrusted data",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns detected; the code is standard for package extension in Python modules",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkgutil' module and calls 'extend_path' to augment __path__ with additional directories for package resource discovery. This is a common practice in namespace packages to include resources from multiple locations. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The code is minimal and straightforward, following typical Python package conventions.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard operation to support namespace packages and does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be legitimate package code intended for resource management.",
