  "purpose": "Extend the current module's __path__ for namespace package support.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and uses extend_path on __path__ and __name__.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output functions; no untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "The import of 'pkgutil' leads to extension of __path__, but no data flow to external systems or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for namespace packages; no unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard library 'pkgutil' and extends the module's __path__ for namespace package support. This is a common pattern used in Python for packages split across multiple directories. There are no inputs, outputs, or untrusted data flows. The code's purpose appears to be to support package namespace extension without any malicious intent. No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign pattern used for namespace packages in Python. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
