{
  "purpose": "The code extends the current package's __path__ attribute to support namespace packaging, enabling the package to be split across multiple directories or distributions.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkgutil' to access the extend_path function and uses __path__ and __name__ variables related to the current package context.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that lead to data leaks or security effects; no untrusted data handling or output operations are present.",
  "flows": "The code imports a standard library function and modifies the __path__ attribute; there are no data flows involving untrusted input or external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code performs a common package extension operation without any obfuscated code or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and calls extend_path on __path__, which is a typical pattern for supporting namespace packages. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leakage, or suspicious behavior. The usage is straightforward and standard for Python package management.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation for supporting namespace packages and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
