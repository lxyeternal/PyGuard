  "purpose": "Supports namespace packages by extending the __path__ attribute dynamically using pkgutil.extend_path.",
  "sources": "Imports 'pkgutil' dynamically and calls extend_path on __path__ with __name__.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data or untrusted input involved.",
  "flows": "Modifies __path__ to include additional directories for package resolution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard pattern for namespace packages. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a common, well-understood pattern in Python for supporting namespace packages. It uses dynamic import and modifies __path__, which is typical and safe. No signs of malicious activity, data leaks, or obfuscation are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, securityRisk≈0.1, obfuscated=0) are appropriate given the benign and standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for namespace package support in Python. All reports correctly identify its purpose and safety. The assigned scores are justified and consistent with the code's behavior. No further action or concern is necessary.",
