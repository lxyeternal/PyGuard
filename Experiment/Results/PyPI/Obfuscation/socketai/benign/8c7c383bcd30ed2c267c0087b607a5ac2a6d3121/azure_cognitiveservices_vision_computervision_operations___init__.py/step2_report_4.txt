  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings, scores, and implications.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports identify the import of a symbol with a seemingly random or obfuscated name ('iNNEMLmLqDskDbQFMFdqqPQopYNyckYe') from a local module '_computer_vision_client_operations'.\n- None of the reports find evidence of malicious activity such as network communication, data exfiltration, code injection, or use of untrusted inputs.\n- The code is minimal, involving only import and export declarations.\n- The obfuscated or nonsensical name is consistent across reports and is flagged as suspicious but not definitively malicious.\n- The confidence levels are generally high (0.6–0.8), reflecting reasonable suspicion based on obfuscation but no concrete malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of the obfuscated symbol:** All reports agree that the symbol 'iNNEMLmLqDskDbQFMFdqqPQopYNyckYe' is obfuscated or auto-generated.\n- **No active malicious activity:** No network, file, or command operations are present.\n- **Code simplicity:** The code is straightforward, with no complex logic or data handling.\n\n### Discrepancies:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, indicating no detected malicious behavior.\n- **Security risk:** Very low (0.1–0.2), consistent with the absence of active threats.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Ranges from 0.2 to 0.7, reflecting varying suspicion about obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n- The obfuscated symbol name warrants further review, but on its own, it does not indicate malicious intent.\n- The import from a local module with no further activity is typical in package code, possibly auto-generated or obfuscated for other reasons.\n- Without additional context (e.g., what the imported symbol does at runtime), it’s impossible to conclude maliciousness.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Scores should remain conservative:** Since no malicious activity is detected, malware score should stay at 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Given the suspicion, a moderate score (~0.6) seems appropriate, but not as high as 0.7–0.8 unless further evidence appears.\n- **Risk score:** Should remain low (~0.1–0.2), as no security risk is evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no evidence of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0.6** (suspicious but not confirmed obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (minimal security risk)\n\n**In conclusion,** the code appears to be a minimal, possibly auto-generated or obfuscated module import with no malicious intent. The suspicion raised by the obfuscated name should be noted for further review if more context becomes available, but based solely on this snippet, it does not constitute a security threat.",
