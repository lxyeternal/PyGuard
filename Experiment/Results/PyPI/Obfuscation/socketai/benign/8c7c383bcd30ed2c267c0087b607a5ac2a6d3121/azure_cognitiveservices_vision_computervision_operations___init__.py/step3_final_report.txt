{
  "purpose": "Minimal import statement from a local module with an obfuscated symbol, and an export list referencing a class name.",
  "sources": "Import from ._computer_vision_client_operations of a symbol named iNNEMLmLqDskDbQFMFdqqPQopYNyckYe",
  "sinks": "None; static code with no data or network operations",
  "flows": "Import of obfuscated symbol; no data flow beyond import and export declaration",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated or auto-generated symbol name; mismatch between imported symbol and __all__ string",
  "analysis": "The code imports a symbol with a suspiciously obfuscated name from a local module, then declares an __all__ list with a class name. No malicious activity, network activity, or data handling is present. The obfuscated name raises suspicion but is not evidence of malicious intent. The minimal code suggests benign usage, possibly auto-generated or placeholder. The scores across reports are consistent: malware score at 0, obfuscation score high (~0.6-0.7), and low security risk (~0.1-0.2). No active threats are detected, but the obfuscated name warrants further review if more context is available.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, involving a minimal import with an obfuscated symbol name. No malicious activity is evident. The obfuscated name warrants further review in a broader context, but based solely on this snippet, it does not constitute a security threat.",
