  "purpose": "Extend the module search path for package namespace sharing",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and uses '__import__' to access it dynamically, then calls 'extend_path' with '__path__' and '__name__'",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leakage or malicious actions",
  "flows": "Imports 'pkgutil' -> calls 'extend_path' with '__path__' and '__name__' -> updates '__path__' with extended path",
  "anomalies": "Use of '__import__' for dynamic import is somewhat unusual but not inherently malicious; no other suspicious behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports 'pkgutil' and extends the module's search path, a common practice for namespace packages. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or obfuscated behavior are present. The pattern is minimal and standard for namespace package support.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard namespace package extension without any malicious intent or security concerns. It is a typical pattern in Python package management and does not indicate malicious behavior.",
