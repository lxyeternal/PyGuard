  "purpose": "Extend the package's __path__ for namespace package support",
  "sources": "Retrieves the 'pkgutil' module and accesses the __path__ variable",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external data flows",
  "flows": "Imports 'pkgutil', then calls extend_path to modify __path__ (which is likely an existing variable in context)",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code performs standard namespace package extension without any suspicious or obfuscated behavior",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and extends the __path__ variable, which is typical for supporting namespace packages in Python. There are no hardcoded credentials, malicious payloads, or suspicious function calls. The code is minimal and performs a common, legitimate operation. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The code simply modifies the module search path for package namespace purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign snippet used in Python namespace packages. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior and poses no security threat.",
