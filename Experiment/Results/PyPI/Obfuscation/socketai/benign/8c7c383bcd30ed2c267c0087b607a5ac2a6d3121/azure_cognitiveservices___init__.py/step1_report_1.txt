  "purpose": "Extend the module's __path__ for package resource discovery.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and uses 'extend_path' to modify __path__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data or external output are present.",
  "flows": "Import of 'pkgutil' leads to modification of __path__, but no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for package resource extension; no unusual or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkgutil' module and calls 'extend_path' to modify the __path__ variable, enabling support for namespace packages or multiple resource directories. This is a common pattern in Python package development. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscation. The code does not contain any hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic. It performs a typical package resource extension operation.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a standard, benign operation used in Python packaging. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks associated with this code.",
