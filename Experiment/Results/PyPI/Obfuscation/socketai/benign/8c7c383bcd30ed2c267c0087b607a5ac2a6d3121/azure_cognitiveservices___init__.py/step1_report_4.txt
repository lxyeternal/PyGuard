{
  "purpose": "Extend the module's __path__ for package namespace sharing across multiple directories.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and uses __import__ to load it dynamically; __path__ and __name__ are built-in package attributes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow leading to untrusted data processing or external effects.",
  "flows": "The code loads 'pkgutil', then calls extend_path with __path__ and __name__, modifying the module's search path.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; this is a standard pattern for namespace packages in Python.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports 'pkgutil' using __import__, then extends the current package's __path__ with the extend_path method. This pattern is common for supporting namespace packages across multiple directories. The use of __import__ is dynamic but standard for such use cases. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident. The code does not perform any data processing, network activity, or file manipulation beyond modifying __path__.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical implementation of Python namespace package extension and does not exhibit malicious intent or security risks.",
