  "purpose": "Extend __path__ for namespace package support, enabling multiple distributions to contribute to the package namespace.",
  "sources": "The code reads from __path__ and dynamically imports 'pkgutil' using __import__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external output; no sinks involved.",
  "flows": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and calls extend_path to modify __path__, with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __import__ instead of a direct import statement; this is a dynamic import pattern but not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard pattern in Python for supporting namespace packages. It involves dynamically importing 'pkgutil' and extending __path__, which is common in package resource management. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or data leakage is present. The use of __import__ is slightly less common but still a legitimate pattern. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and very low security risk (~0), justified by the benign and standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard namespace package extension pattern with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports are accurate and consistent. No adjustments to scores are necessary.",
