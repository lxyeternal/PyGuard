  "purpose": "Extend the module's search path for package resource loading.",
  "sources": "Uses __import__('pkgutil') to import the pkgutil module, then calls extend_path with __path__ and __name__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or output functions present.",
  "flows": "Imports pkgutil, then extends __path__ with __name__ — no data flow to external sources or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears to be a standard pattern for namespace packages; no suspicious or unusual code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkgutil' module using dynamic import syntax, then calls 'extend_path' to modify the __path__ variable for namespace package support. This is a common pattern in Python packages to allow multiple distributions to contribute to a namespace. No hardcoded secrets, no data exfiltration, or malicious control flow detected. The code does not perform any I/O, network operations, or manipulate sensitive data. It appears to be standard packaging code rather than malicious or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements standard namespace package extension logic and does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. It is a typical pattern used in Python packaging to support namespace packages.",
