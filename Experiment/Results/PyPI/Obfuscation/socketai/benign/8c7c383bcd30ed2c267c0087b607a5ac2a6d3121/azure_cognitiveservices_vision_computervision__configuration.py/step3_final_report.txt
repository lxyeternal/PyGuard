{
  "purpose": "Configuration subclass for Azure Cognitive Services Vision API, setting up endpoint, credentials, and user agent headers.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'endpoint' and 'credentials'; version import from local module.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no network calls, data leaks, or malicious data handling.",
  "flows": "Input parameters validated and assigned; version string used in user agent header; no external data flow or malicious payload.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; placeholder '{Endpoint}' in URL; version token in user agent; minor casing inconsistency ('Endpoint' vs 'endpoint').",
  "analysis": "The code validates input parameters, constructs a URL with a placeholder, sets connection attributes, and adds a user agent with a version string. Obfuscation is present but appears to be a code obfuscation tactic rather than malicious intent. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code is detected. The obfuscation and placeholder URL are suspicious but not malicious. The code aligns with standard SDK configuration patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate SDK configuration class with obfuscation tactics. No malicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident. The obfuscation warrants cautious review but does not indicate malicious intent. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score is zero.",
