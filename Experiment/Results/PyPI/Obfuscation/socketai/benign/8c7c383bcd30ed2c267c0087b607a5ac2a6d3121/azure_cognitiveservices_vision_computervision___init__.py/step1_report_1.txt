{
  "purpose": "The code imports internal modules and exports specific classes or variables related to a computer vision client configuration and versioning.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules: ._configuration, ._computer_vision_client, and .version",
  "sinks": "Assignment of imported variables to module-level identifiers and export via __all__",
  "flows": "Imported internal variables are assigned to public identifiers, and version string is aliased",
  "anomalies": "All imported names are obfuscated, using non-descriptive variable names, which may indicate obfuscation or concealment. No code executes external commands or writes data. No hardcoded secrets are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward imports from internal modules, assigns imported variables to public identifiers, and re-exports version info under an alias. The variable names are intentionally obfuscated, which could be to hide their purpose or as an obfuscation technique. There are no suspicious function calls, no external network connections, no hardcoded credentials, and no dynamic code execution. The structure is typical for module setup, but the obfuscation warrants further review if found in a larger codebase.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a typical module initialization with obfuscated variable names, likely to hide internal details or for code protection. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet.",
