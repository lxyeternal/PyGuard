  "purpose": "Module setup and re-export of internal components with obfuscated identifiers",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules, assignment of version info, and export via __all__",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present",
  "flows": "Imports → Assignments → Exports",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and class names, assignment of version string to an obfuscated variable",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward import statements from internal modules with obfuscated names, assigning imported variables to module-level identifiers, and defining __all__ for exports. No external network activity, data processing, or code execution is evident. The obfuscation appears to be for internal concealment or auto-generation, not malicious intent. The malware score is 0, risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), and obfuscation score is moderate (~0.7), consistent with the obfuscated identifiers. Confidence in benign nature is high (0.8). No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module setup with obfuscated internal identifiers, likely for internal concealment or auto-generation. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
