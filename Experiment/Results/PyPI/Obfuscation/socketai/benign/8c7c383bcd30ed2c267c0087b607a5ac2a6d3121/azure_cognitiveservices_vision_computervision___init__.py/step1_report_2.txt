  ],
  "analysis": "The code imports what appear to be internal or private components, using obfuscated names for classes and variables, which can be a technique to hide functionality. The module exports certain classes and variables to be used externally. There is no visible malicious behavior, such as network access, data exfiltration, or code execution. The obfuscation could be a concern if intended to hide malicious functionality, but based solely on this snippet, it seems to be an attempt at hiding internal implementation details rather than malicious activity. No dangerous or suspicious code patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily re-exports obfuscated internal components, likely for internal SDK use. No malicious behavior or security risks are apparent. The use of obfuscated identifiers warrants caution but does not necessarily indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code appears benign.",
