{
  "purpose": "The code appears to import specific classes and variables for configuring and using a computer vision client, likely as part of a larger SDK or package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (_configuration, _computer_vision_client, version). No external or untrusted data sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs that handle untrusted data are present. The code only defines imports and exports.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow; the code only establishes internal references and exports.",
  "anomalies": "The imported identifiers are obfuscated (non-descriptive, seemingly random strings), which could indicate code obfuscation or lack of code clarity. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two obfuscated variables or classes from internal modules, then assigns a version string to a more meaningful variable. The use of obfuscated names suggests an attempt to hide internal details, but there are no signs of malicious activity or malicious code. The code structure is minimal and typical for module exports, with no external data handling or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module that manages internal class and version exports, with obfuscated identifiers that do not indicate malicious intent. No malicious behavior or security risks are apparent from this fragment.",
