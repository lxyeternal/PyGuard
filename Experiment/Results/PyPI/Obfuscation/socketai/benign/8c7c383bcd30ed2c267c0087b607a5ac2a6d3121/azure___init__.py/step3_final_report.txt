  "purpose": "Support for namespace packages by extending __path__ using pkgutil's extend_path function.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it dynamically imports 'pkgutil' and operates on existing package variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external data flows; no data leaks or external effects are present.",
  "flows": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and modifies '__path__' directly; no external data flows involved.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __import__('pkgutil') instead of a direct import is slightly unusual but not malicious; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard pattern for supporting namespace packages in Python. It dynamically imports 'pkgutil' and extends '__path__' with 'extend_path', which is a common practice. No untrusted input, no network activity, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscation are present. All reports correctly identify this pattern as benign, assigning malware and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The use of __import__ with a string literal is unconventional but not suspicious. Overall, the code is straightforward, well-understood, and poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation for namespace package extension. No malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or security risks are detected. The scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
