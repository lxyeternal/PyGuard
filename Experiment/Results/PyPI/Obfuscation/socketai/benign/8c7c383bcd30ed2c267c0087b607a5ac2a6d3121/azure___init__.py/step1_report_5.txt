  "purpose": "Extend the current module's __path__ for package resource discovery.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and uses '__import__' to dynamically access 'pkgutil'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "The code dynamically imports 'pkgutil' and assigns to '__path__' the result of 'extend_path', which modifies the module's search path.",
  "anomalies": "Use of '__import__' with a string literal is unusual but not inherently malicious; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports 'pkgutil' and extends the module's __path__, which is standard for package resource extension in Python. There are no external inputs or untrusted data sources. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The code's structure and purpose align with legitimate package extension mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard pattern used for package resource management in Python modules. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
