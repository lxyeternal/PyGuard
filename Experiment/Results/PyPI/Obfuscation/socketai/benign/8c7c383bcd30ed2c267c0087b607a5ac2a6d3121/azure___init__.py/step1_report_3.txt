{
  "purpose": "Extend the module's __path__ for package resource discovery.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and uses 'extend_path' with '__path__' and '__name__'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input or lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "The code imports a standard library module and modifies '__path__' for package extension; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs a common pattern for namespace packages; no unusual or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically extends the module's search path using 'pkgutil.extend_path', which is a standard practice for namespace packages. It involves importing 'pkgutil' and modifying '__path__'. This pattern is used to enable multiple distributions to contribute to the same namespace package. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues. The code is minimal and adheres to typical namespace package patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for namespace package support and does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks.",
