{
  "purpose": "Extend the package's __path__ for namespace package support, enabling the package to be split across multiple directories.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'pkgutil' module and uses it to extend the __path__ variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or cause data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and modifies __path__, which is a standard operation without involving external or untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, standard for namespace packages, and does not contain any suspicious or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code uses '__import__' to dynamically load 'pkgutil' and calls 'extend_path' to modify '__path__'. This is a common pattern in namespace packages to support splitting a package across multiple directories. There are no hardcoded secrets, no data flows from untrusted sources, and no dynamic execution of untrusted code. The code is concise and adheres to typical namespace package implementation practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation for namespace packages and does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks.",
