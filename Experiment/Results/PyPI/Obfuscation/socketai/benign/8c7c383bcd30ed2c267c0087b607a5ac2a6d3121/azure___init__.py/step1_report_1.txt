{
  "purpose": "This code extends the module's search path using pkgutil's extend_path method, typically to support namespace packages.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and uses __path__ and __name__ to modify the package search path.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and modifies __path__ with extend_path, which is standard for namespace packages; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for namespace package extension; no anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkgutil' to extend the __path__ of the current package using 'extend_path', which is a common practice for namespace packages. There is no use of untrusted input, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic execution, and no malicious logic. The purpose appears to be to support modular or distributed package components. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for namespace packages and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
