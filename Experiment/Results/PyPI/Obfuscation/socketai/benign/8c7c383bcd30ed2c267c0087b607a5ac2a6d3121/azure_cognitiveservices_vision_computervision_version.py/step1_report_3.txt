  "purpose": "Assign a version string to a variable",
  "sources": "The string assignment to the variable 'bSfHWscMlnwjUxIGUZGfozlIsUioxKcD'",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sinks",
  "flows": "None; simple variable assignment without data flow to external functions or systems",
  "anomalies": "The variable name appears obfuscated or nonsensical; the value is a straightforward version string",
  "analysis": "The code contains a single line that assigns a string '0.9.1' to a variable with an obfuscated name. There are no input sources, no sinks, and no data flows. The variable name seems intentionally obscure, but the assigned value is a typical version string. No malicious code, data leakage, or suspicious behavior is evident. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign assignment of a version string to an obfuscated variable name. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
