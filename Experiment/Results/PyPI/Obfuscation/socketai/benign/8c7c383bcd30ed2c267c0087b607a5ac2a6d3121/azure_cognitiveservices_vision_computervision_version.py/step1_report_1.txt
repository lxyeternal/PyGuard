  "anomalies": "The variable name appears random and obfuscated, but it does not perform any suspicious actions",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a string representing a version number to a variable with a seemingly random name. There are no inputs, no data processing, no external network calls, or other suspicious behaviors. The variable name is obfuscated, but this alone does not indicate malicious intent. The code is minimal and standard in function.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply assigns a version string to a variable with an obfuscated name. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks present.",
