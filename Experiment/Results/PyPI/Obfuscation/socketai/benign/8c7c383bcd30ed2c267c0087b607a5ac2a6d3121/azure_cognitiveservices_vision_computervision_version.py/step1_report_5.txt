  "purpose": "Assigns a string '0.9.1' to a variable named 'bSfHWscMlnwjUxIGUZGfozlIsUioxKcD'.",
  "sources": "Assignment operation reading the string '0.9.1'.",
  "sinks": "Variable assignment, no external sinks or data outputs observed.",
  "flows": "Input source (string) assigned to variable; no data flow to external systems or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "Variable name appears as a random, nonsensical string; no meaningful or suspicious behavior in the code itself.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a version string to a variable with an obfuscated name. There are no external inputs, no data leaks, no network connections, and no dynamic code execution. The variable name appears intentionally obfuscated, which could suggest hiding intent, but on its own, the code is harmless.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a basic variable assignment with an obfuscated variable name and a version string. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this fragment.",
