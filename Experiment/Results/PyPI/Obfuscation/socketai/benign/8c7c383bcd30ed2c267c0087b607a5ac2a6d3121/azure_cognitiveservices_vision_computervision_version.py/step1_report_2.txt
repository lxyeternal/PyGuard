  "purpose": "Assignment of a version string to a variable.",
  "sources": "Assignment operation where the string '0.9.1' is assigned to a variable named 'bSfHWscMlnwjUxIGUZGfozlIsUioxKcD'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources; the code does not process external input or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code simply assigns a static string to a variable.",
  "anomalies": "Variable name appears as a random string, but this alone is not suspicious; no hardcoded credentials or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single assignment statement, setting a version string to a variable with an obfuscated or random name. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security issues. The variable name does not reveal any malicious intent or obfuscation beyond a simple naming choice.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign variable assignment of a version string, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
