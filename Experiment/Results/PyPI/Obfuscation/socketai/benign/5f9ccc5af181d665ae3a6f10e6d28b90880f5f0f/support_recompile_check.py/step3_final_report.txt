  "purpose": "The code verifies puzzle files by reading their hex content, deleting the files, and running external binaries ('../target/release/run' and '../target/release/opc') to process and compare outputs for consistency.",
  "sources": "Reads puzzle files from predefined directories, constructs file paths, and reads hex-encoded content.",
  "sinks": "Executes external binaries via subprocess with file paths as arguments, deletes files after reading.",
  "flows": "Reads file content -> runs external binaries with file paths -> captures and decodes output -> compares with original content.",
  "anomalies": "Relies on external binaries without validation, deletes files immediately after reading, no input sanitization or validation of filenames or paths.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a verification process on puzzle files by executing external binaries and comparing outputs. It does not contain malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation. The main security concern is dependence on external binaries which could be malicious if compromised. Files are deleted post-read, which could hide malicious artifacts, but this is typical for cleanup. No secrets or data leaks are evident. The code is straightforward and lacks obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a puzzle verification pipeline with no evidence of malicious behavior. External dependencies pose a security risk if untrusted, but the code itself is benign. Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.3-0.4 reflecting external dependency concerns.",
