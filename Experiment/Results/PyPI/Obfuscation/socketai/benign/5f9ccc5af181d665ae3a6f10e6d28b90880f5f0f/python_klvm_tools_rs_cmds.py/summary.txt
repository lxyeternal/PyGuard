  "conclusion": "The code exhibits risky practices through dynamic code execution with exec(), which could be exploited. No evidence of malicious activity is present, but the pattern warrants refactoring. The malware score should be low (around 0.2), the obfuscation moderate (around 0.4), and the security risk high (around 0.7), reflecting the pattern's inherent danger."
