{
  "purpose": "The code appears to handle compilation, hashing, and symbol management for klvm programs, potentially for a blockchain or cryptographic application.",
  "sources": "Reads files from the filesystem (hex files, symbol files), open() calls, file reading, and writing operations.",
  "sinks": "File writing operations, deletion of files, and printing logs. No direct network or system command execution observed.",
  "flows": "Reads source code files -> compiles to hex -> computes hashes -> compares previous and current hashes -> writes symbols to files.",
  "anomalies": "Use of try-except block without specific exception handling around file deletion; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious hardcoded secrets detected; no obfuscated code patterns; no dynamic code execution or hidden backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs file-based operations: compiling programs, hashing outputs, and verifying consistency between current and previous compilations. It uses standard libraries for file I/O, path manipulations, and third-party tools for compilation and hashing. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or system compromise. The file deletion is handled silently, which could mask potential issues, but this alone is not malicious. The code appears to serve a development or build verification purpose rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a build verification script for klvm programs involving hash checks and symbol management. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. It is a standard build verification tool with no signs of malware or malicious code.",
