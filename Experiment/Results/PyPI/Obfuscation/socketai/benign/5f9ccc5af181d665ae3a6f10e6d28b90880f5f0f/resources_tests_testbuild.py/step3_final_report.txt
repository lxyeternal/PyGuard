  "purpose": "Build verification and integrity checking for KLVM programs, involving compilation, hashing, symbol management, and file operations.",
  "sources": "Reading source files, hex files, symbol files, and previous hash and symbol data from disk.",
  "sinks": "File deletions, hash comparisons, and assertions that enforce integrity; no external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Source files are read for compilation and hashing; hashes and symbols are compared; files are deleted if hashes differ; assertions verify consistency.",
  "anomalies": "Use of assertions for hash verification, silent file deletions with broad exception handling, no validation of input files, but these are typical in build scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard build and verification tasks for KLVM programs, with no network activity, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior. Assertions are used for integrity checks, and file deletions are handled with try-except, which is common in such scripts. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate given the operational context. Overall, the code is benign and intended for legitimate build verification.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious build verification utility with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The scores are consistent with its behavior. No modifications are necessary.",
