{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from the module '.klvm_tools_rs', likely to use functions or classes defined there.",
  "sources": "Import statement: 'from .klvm_tools_rs import *', which loads all symbols from the local module.",
  "sinks": "Potentially any functions or attributes used later from 'klvm_tools_rs' could act as sinks if they process untrusted input, but not evident from this snippet.",
  "flows": "Not identifiable in this single line; depends on how imported functions or classes are used downstream.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import '*' can obscure what is imported, possibly hiding malicious or unnecessary code. No other anomalies apparent.",
  "analysis": "This code is a single import statement from a local module. Without additional context or code that uses the imported symbols, no malicious activity or security issues can be determined. The import itself is standard Python practice, though wildcard imports can reduce code clarity and are discouraged. No evidence of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks is present solely based on this line.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement from a local module, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities in this isolated snippet.",
