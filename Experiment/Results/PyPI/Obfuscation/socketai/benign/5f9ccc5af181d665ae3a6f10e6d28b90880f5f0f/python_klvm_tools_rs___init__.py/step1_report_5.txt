{
  "purpose": "Import all functions and classes from the local module 'klvm_tools_rs'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module 'klvm_tools_rs' in the current package.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of imported functions or classes could lead to data processing or execution points, but the import statement itself does not pose a direct risk.",
  "flows": "No direct data flows are visible from the import statement alone; flows depend on subsequent use of imported items.",
  "anomalies": "The code only contains a single import statement with a relative import syntax. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The snippet is minimal, performing a relative import of all symbols from 'klvm_tools_rs'. It does not include any executable logic, data processing, or network activity. Without additional context or usage, it cannot be deemed malicious. The import syntax is standard in Python modules and does not imply malicious intent by itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no evident malicious behavior or security risks. It appears benign and typical for a module importing dependencies.",
