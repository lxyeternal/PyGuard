  "purpose": "Import all functions, classes, or variables from the module '.klvm_tools_rs'.",
  "sources": "Import statement that reads from a relative module '.klvm_tools_rs'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are evident; the import could potentially lead to execution of malicious code if the module itself is compromised.",
  "flows": "The code imports the module; any functions or code executed later in the package may originate from this module.",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative import syntax is common, but without context, it could obscure the origin of imported code. No explicit anomalies in this single line.",
  "analysis": "This is a single-line import statement that brings in all symbols from the '.klvm_tools_rs' module. No further code or context is provided, limiting analysis. If the imported module is malicious, it could execute malicious code when imported or later used. The line itself does not contain malicious behavior, but it relies on the integrity of the imported module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no immediate malicious behavior. The security depends on the integrity and trustworthiness of the '.klvm_tools_rs' module. No signs of malicious intent are evident from this line alone.",
