  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious behavior, logical flaws, and the consistency of the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe a simple import statement: `from .klvm_tools_rs import *` or similar.\n- No code beyond the import is provided, so assessment of runtime behavior is limited.\n- The core concern is whether the imported module could be malicious or obfuscated, which cannot be determined from the import statement alone.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code presence:** All reports accurately describe the import statement; no discrepancies.\n- **Malicious code:** The import line itself is benign; malicious behavior would depend on the contents of `klvm_tools_rs`, which is not provided.\n- **Obfuscation:** None of the reports mention obfuscation in the module, only the use of wildcard import which can obscure what is imported.\n\n---\n\n### Specific issues and scoring:\n- **Malware score:** All reports currently assign 0.0, which is appropriate given the limited context.\n- **Security risk:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting minimal concern based solely on the import statement.\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- The reports are consistent and cautious, correctly emphasizing that the security implications depend on the imported module's integrity.\n- Use of `import *` is discouraged but not inherently malicious; no evidence of obfuscation or malicious intent is present.\n- The confidence scores vary but are generally reasonable given the limited context.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Scores for malware:** Should remain at 0 unless additional code or context suggests malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** Should stay at 0; no obfuscation is evident.\n- **Risk scores:** Given the minimal code, a low risk score (around 0.1) is appropriate, unless future code indicates otherwise.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0.0** (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0.0** (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (minimal, due to reliance on external module trust)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are consistent and cautious, correctly noting that the security implications depend on the imported module's trustworthiness. No immediate issues are evident from this import statement alone.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep malware and obfuscated scores at 0.0.  \n- Maintain a very low security risk score (~0.1).  \n- Further analysis requires inspecting the contents of `klvm_tools_rs`.",
