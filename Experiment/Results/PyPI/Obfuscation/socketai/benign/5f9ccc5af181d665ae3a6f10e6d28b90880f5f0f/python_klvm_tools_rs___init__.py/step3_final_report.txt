  "purpose": "Assess the security implications of a minimal import statement in a Python package, focusing on potential malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from .klvm_tools_rs import *', which reads the module's symbols into the current namespace.",
  "sinks": "Not applicable; no untrusted data or external effects are evident in the code snippet.",
  "flows": "The import loads symbols from 'klvm_tools_rs' into the current namespace; no further data flow is present.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('import *') which can obscure imported symbols; no malicious code or obfuscation detected in the snippet itself.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement, which by itself is benign. The security concern hinges on the contents of 'klvm_tools_rs', which are not provided. The import does not execute code beyond symbol loading. Malware or malicious behavior could exist within the imported module, but this cannot be determined from the snippet. The use of 'import *' is discouraged for namespace clarity but is not inherently malicious. The malware score remains at 0, reflecting no evidence of malicious intent. The risk score is low (~0.1), acknowledging that trustworthiness depends on the external module. Obfuscation is not present. The confidence in these conclusions is high, given the minimal code and standard import behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is benign in isolation; the security implications depend entirely on the trustworthiness of 'klvm_tools_rs'. No malicious activity or obfuscation is evident. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the minimal code snippet.",
