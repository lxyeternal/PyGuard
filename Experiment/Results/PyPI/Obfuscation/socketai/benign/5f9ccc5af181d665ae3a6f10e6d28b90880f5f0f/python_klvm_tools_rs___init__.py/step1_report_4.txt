{
  "purpose": "The code imports everything from the module '.klvm_tools_rs', likely to access its functions or classes.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a relative module '.klvm_tools_rs'.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly shown in this snippet; potential risk if the imported module executes malicious code upon import.",
  "flows": "Import of the module occurs at the start; no further code present to indicate data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' is generally discouraged, but not inherently malicious. No other unusual behavior or secrets are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet only contains an import statement from a relative module. It does not perform any data processing, input/output, or network operations. The import may load code that could contain malicious behavior, but the snippet alone does not demonstrate this. The use of 'import *' could potentially hide malicious functions, but without seeing the module's content, this cannot be confirmed.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The potential for malicious activity depends entirely on the contents of 'klvm_tools_rs'. The code is minimal and does not perform any suspicious actions itself.",
