  "purpose": "Invoke a function from an obfuscated module with a hardcoded list of filename/path tuples, potentially for processing or loading resources.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded list of filename/path tuples within the script.",
  "sinks": "The imported function 'VeJWQhhxvFHDKpOmRrbEbguqjUSNhDjx' which may process the data, potentially executing malicious code depending on its implementation.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the hardcoded list into the imported function; the function's internal behavior determines subsequent actions.",
  "anomalies": "Non-standard shebang line with a suspicious string, heavily obfuscated module and function names, static data with unusual file extensions, and no external input or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code imports an obfuscated module and calls an obfuscated function with static data. The shebang line is highly unusual and suggests obfuscation or misdirection. Without the implementation details of the imported function, the actual behavior cannot be confirmed. The static list and obfuscated identifiers are suspicious but do not constitute direct malicious activity. The high obfuscation score (~0.7) is justified. The malware suspicion is moderate (~0.4), considering the obfuscation and suspicious shebang, which could be used to hide malicious actions. The overall security risk is also moderate (~0.4). The code warrants further static and dynamic analysis of the 'testbuild' module and the invoked function to determine if malicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The script exhibits high obfuscation and suspicious patterns, notably the unusual shebang line and obfuscated identifiers. While no direct malicious activity is evident from the code snippet alone, these indicators justify a cautious stance. The current scores reflect moderate suspicion, emphasizing the need for further investigation into the external module and function behavior before confirming malicious intent.",
