  "purpose": "Recursive SHA-256 hashing functions, likely for cryptographic or key-stretching purposes.",
  "sources": "Input parameters N and X within the functions, and the include statement for standard libraries.",
  "sinks": "No external data sources, network activity, or file operations; no untrusted data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Input parameters N and X are used in recursive calls leading to SHA-256 hashing; no external sinks or data exfiltration observed.",
  "anomalies": "Duplicate function definitions and inclusion of standard library; no malicious or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two similar recursive functions performing SHA-256 hashing based on parameters N and X. No malicious behavior, network activity, or data exfiltration is present. The recursive pattern could cause resource exhaustion if N is large, but this is typical in cryptographic routines. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are evident. The code's purpose appears benign, and the inclusion of standard libraries is normal. Scores assigned in reports (malware=0, low risk=0.1-0.2, obfuscation=0-0.2) are consistent with the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of recursive cryptographic hashing functions, with no signs of malicious intent. The primary concern is resource exhaustion if N is unbounded, but this is a known cryptographic pattern, not malicious. Overall, the code poses minimal security risk and is not malicious.",
