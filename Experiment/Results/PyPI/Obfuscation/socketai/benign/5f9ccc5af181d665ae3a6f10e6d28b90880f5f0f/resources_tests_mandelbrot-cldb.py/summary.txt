  "conclusion": "The code is a standard testing snippet that executes a command and verifies its output. No malware or obfuscation is present. The main security risk is command injection if 'command' is influenced by untrusted sources. The scores are appropriate; the malware and obfuscation scores are 0, and the security risk score is around 0.4. To improve security, validate or sanitize 'command' before execution when sourcing from untrusted inputs."
