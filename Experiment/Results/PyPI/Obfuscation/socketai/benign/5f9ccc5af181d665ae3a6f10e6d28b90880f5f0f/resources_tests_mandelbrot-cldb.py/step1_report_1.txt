  "purpose": "Execute an external command and assert its output matches an expected value",
  "sources": "subprocess.check_output(command)",
  "sinks": "assert statement (which may terminate program if condition fails)",
  "flows": "subprocess.check_output(command) → have_output; assert have_output == want_output",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess without validation of 'command' contents, assertion may be used for control flow or testing",
  "analysis": "The code runs an external command using subprocess.check_output, decodes its output, and asserts it equals a predefined value. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code are evident. The assert could be exploited if 'command' or 'want_output' are influenced by untrusted input, leading to denial of service if assertion fails, but this is typical in testing environments. The code itself does not contain obfuscation or malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet performs a standard command execution and output verification. It does not display malicious intent but could be misused if 'command' or 'want_output' are externally influenced without validation. Overall, it appears safe and typical for testing purposes.",
