  "purpose": "Performs kernel density estimation (KDE) on input data with optional plotting; uses obfuscated variable and function names.",
  "sources": "Input data array 'cvdcykWpUAGFrMHYAKnOwxuXTJwhocuO', possibly from external data sources or files.",
  "sinks": "score_samples method outputs; optional plotting functions that visualize data points and density estimates.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into KDE model, then into score_samples; if plotting enabled, data points and density are visualized.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of variable and function names; suspicious or misspelled plotting function calls; syntax errors in some plotting code suggest incomplete or intentionally confusing code.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard KDE using scikit-learn, with obfuscated identifiers and suspicious plotting functions that do not match standard matplotlib syntax. No evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or hardcoded secrets. The obfuscation appears to be the primary concern, possibly for concealment. The code's core logic is legitimate for data analysis, but the obfuscation warrants caution. Scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0.7, risk=0.2) are consistent with the observed obfuscation but no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate KDE implementation with heavy obfuscation, likely for concealment rather than malicious activity. No evidence suggests malware or security threats; the primary concern is obfuscation, which does not inherently imply malicious intent.",
