{
  "purpose": "A clustering and visualization utility performing data normalization, clustering, evaluation, and plotting, with external dependencies and result saving.",
  "sources": "Input data parameters, external data fetch via dz.get(), and data read from function arguments or pickle files.",
  "sinks": "Saving plots and results via pickle, exporting figures, and optional data enrichment; no network or system modification observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input through normalization, clustering, evaluation, visualization, and finally to saving or exporting results.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names; conditional imports of external libraries ('hnet', 'd3blocks', 'hdbscan') which could be exploited if malicious versions are used.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard clustering workflows with additional visualization and evaluation steps. Obfuscation appears deliberate, likely to hinder reverse engineering, but no malicious payloads or network activity are evident. External dependencies are handled with try-except blocks, and the code includes warnings and flexible options. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present. The complex control flow and dynamic imports could be used to mask malicious behavior, but current analysis shows no evidence of such activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate clustering and visualization utility with moderate obfuscation. No malicious activity or sabotage is detected. External dependencies should be verified for integrity, but the code itself appears benign.",
