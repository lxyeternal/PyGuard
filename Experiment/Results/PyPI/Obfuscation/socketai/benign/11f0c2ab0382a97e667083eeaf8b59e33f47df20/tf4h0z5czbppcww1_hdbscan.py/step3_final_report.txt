  "purpose": "Performs clustering with HDBSCAN, normalizes data, and visualizes results with plots saved to user-specified filenames.",
  "sources": "Reads input data for clustering; filename derived from user input for saving plots.",
  "sinks": "Saving plot files using filenames directly from user input without validation.",
  "flows": "Input data -> clustering -> visualization -> saving plots with user-provided filenames.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated variable names, dynamic filename construction without validation, import of obscure modules, undefined variables like 'n_clusters'.",
  "analysis": "The code executes standard clustering and visualization routines. The main security concern is the handling of filenames for saving plots, which are derived from user input without sanitization, risking path traversal or overwriting files. Obfuscation through variable naming and module imports suggests an attempt to conceal intent but does not indicate malicious activity. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are evident. The code's core functions are typical for clustering workflows, with the primary risk being filename handling. The obfuscation score is high due to variable naming and module import complexity, but no active malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard clustering and visualization pipeline with significant obfuscation. No evidence of malware or malicious intent is present. The main security concern is the unsanitized filenames used for saving plots, which could be exploited for directory traversal or file overwriting. Overall, the code is benign but warrants filename validation to mitigate potential risks.",
