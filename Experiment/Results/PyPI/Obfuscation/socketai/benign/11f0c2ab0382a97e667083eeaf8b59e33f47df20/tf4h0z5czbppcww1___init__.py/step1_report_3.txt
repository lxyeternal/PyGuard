  "purpose": "This code initializes logging and imports modules from the 'clusteval' package, setting up a clustering validation environment and providing example usage in the comments.",
  "sources": "Logging configuration and imports from 'clusteval' package; no external or untrusted input sources present.",
  "sinks": "Logging outputs; no untrusted data handling or output to external systems identified.",
  "flows": "Initialization of logger and formatting, followed by usage example comments. No data flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code appears straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets aside from email and version info, which are benign.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily sets up logging for the 'clusteval' package and includes a descriptive docstring with usage examples. There are no input handling, data processing, or network communications. The imports are standard and do not execute malicious code. The variables for email and version are hardcoded but not sensitive. No obfuscated or suspicious code structures are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with example usage comments. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The logging configuration is standard, and no untrusted data handling or external communications are evident.",
