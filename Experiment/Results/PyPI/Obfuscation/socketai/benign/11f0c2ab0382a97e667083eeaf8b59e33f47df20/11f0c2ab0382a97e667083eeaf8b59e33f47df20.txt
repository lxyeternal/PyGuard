The high obfuscation is likely intended to conceal complexity or proprietary logic but does not constitute malware. The malware score should remain at 0, and the overall security risk is low. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not justify avoiding use based solely on security grounds."

The primary concern is the obfuscated import statements, which could be used to hide malicious modules or payloads. No direct malicious activity is detected, but the obfuscation suggests a need for further static and dynamic analysis of the imported modules. Overall, the code's behavior is benign, but caution is advised due to obfuscation."

The main security concern is the unsanitized filenames used for saving plots, which could be exploited for directory traversal or file overwriting. Overall, the code is benign but warrants filename validation to mitigate potential risks."
