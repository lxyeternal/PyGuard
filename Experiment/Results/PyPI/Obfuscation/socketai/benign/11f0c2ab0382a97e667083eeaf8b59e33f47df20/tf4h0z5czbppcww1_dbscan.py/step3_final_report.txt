  "purpose": "Performs clustering analysis with normalization, parameter tuning, and visualization.",
  "sources": "Reads input data (cvdcykWpUAGFrMHYAKnOwxuXTJwhocuO), configuration parameters, and imported utility functions.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that lead to data leaks, network activity, or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input data through normalization (if enabled), into clustering (DBSCAN or grid search), then into evaluation metrics and visualization functions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names and obscure imports from 'clusteval.utils'; no malicious code or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code executes a clustering pipeline with optional normalization, parameter tuning via grid search, and visualization. No network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection observed. Obfuscation is present but appears to be a stylistic choice rather than malicious intent. The functions perform standard clustering evaluation and plotting routines. No malicious payloads or behaviors are evident from static analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate clustering analysis utility with obfuscated variable names. No evidence of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score should remain at 0. The obfuscation score can be moderate (~0.6) due to variable naming but does not imply malicious intent.",
