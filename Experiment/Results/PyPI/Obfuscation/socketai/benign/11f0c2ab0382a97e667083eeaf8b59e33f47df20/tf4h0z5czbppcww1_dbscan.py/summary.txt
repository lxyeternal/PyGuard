  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate clustering analysis utility with obfuscated variable names. No evidence of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score should remain at 0. The obfuscation score can be moderate (~0.6) due to variable naming but does not imply malicious intent."
