  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate media processing utility that generates ffmpeg command options based on user parameters. Although obfuscated, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The primary concern is the obfuscation, which could hide malicious intent, but based on available information, the code appears safe."
