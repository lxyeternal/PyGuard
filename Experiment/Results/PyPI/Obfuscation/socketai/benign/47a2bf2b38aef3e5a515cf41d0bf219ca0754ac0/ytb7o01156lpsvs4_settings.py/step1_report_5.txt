{
  "purpose": "The code defines data classes for video and audio encoding configurations, including methods for generating ffmpeg command-line arguments based on specified parameters.",
  "sources": "Input sources include 'language', 'format_name', 'ffmpeg_name', 'Codec' object attributes, and method parameters for codecs, quality, preset, width, and subtitle language.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are the generation of ffmpeg command-line strings, particularly involving codec options, bitrate, resolution, and language mappings. No untrusted data is directly written or transmitted externally within this code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from object attributes (like 'language', 'format_name', 'codec') into command strings through __str__ methods and helper functions, with some conditional logic influencing command construction.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code constructs. The code includes obfuscated variable names, but they serve to store typical encoding parameters. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily constructs ffmpeg command strings based on input parameters and object states. The functions seem to be straightforward in translating configuration options into command-line arguments, with proper handling of format-specific options and mappings. The only minor concern is the obfuscated variable names, which might be a code obfuscation attempt, but they do not indicate malicious intent. No suspicious data leaks, external connections, or malicious payloads are detected. Overall, the code performs expected video/audio encoding configuration logic without evidence of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign configuration utility for ffmpeg commands related to video and audio processing. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The obfuscated variable names seem to serve as code obfuscation rather than malicious sabotage. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to misuse of ffmpeg parameters if used improperly, but not malicious code per se.",
