{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes for media encoding configurations, generating ffmpeg command strings based on attributes such as language, codec, bitrate, quality, preset, and resolution.",
  "sources": "Class attributes like 'language', 'gGWeumyyqZdJzYwizYrpHbmHCLatLair', 'bitrate', 'quality', 'preset', 'width', and external functions such as 'to_iso639_2', 'get_ffmpeg_codec', and 'get_ffmpeg_name'.",
  "sinks": "String concatenations that produce ffmpeg command options, such as '-map', '-acodec', '-ab', '-ac', '-vcodec', '-preset', '-vf', '-crf', and others.",
  "flows": "Data flows from class attributes through methods that generate command-line options, e.g., language and codec attributes influence command string via string formatting; codec selection influences get_ffmpeg_codec output.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and method names (e.g., 'gGWeumyyqZdJzYwizYrpHbmHCLatLair', 'qrpRFtLjKKhIypUzYozixjYoIUaPZpPv'), which could be an attempt to conceal intent; no network or system modification observed.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs ffmpeg command strings based on media encoding parameters, with obfuscated identifiers. No network activity, data exfiltration, or system modification is present. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not directly indicate malicious intent. External functions and classes are assumed safe. The code's purpose appears to be configuration for media processing, not malicious payload delivery.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate media processing utility that generates ffmpeg command options based on user parameters. Although obfuscated, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The primary concern is the obfuscation, which could hide malicious intent, but based on available information, the code appears safe.",
