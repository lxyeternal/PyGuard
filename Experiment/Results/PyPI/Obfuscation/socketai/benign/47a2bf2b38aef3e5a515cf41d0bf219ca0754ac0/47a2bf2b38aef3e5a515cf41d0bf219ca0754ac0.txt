      "conclusion": "The code is limited to obfuscated import statements with no active malicious behavior detected. Obfuscation alone does not confirm malicious intent but warrants further review of the imported modules. Scores are appropriately low, with high obfuscation indicating potential concealment but not necessarily malicious activity."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for terminal message coloring with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The only improvement would be adding input validation for robustness, but this does not impact security. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, except for report 5's security risk score, which should be lowered to 0 to reflect the benign nature."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate media processing utility that generates ffmpeg command options based on user parameters. Although obfuscated, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The primary concern is the obfuscation, which could hide malicious intent, but based on available information, the code appears safe."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate media processing utility with obfuscation that hampers readability but does not demonstrate malicious intent. The main security concern is potential command injection if inputs are untrusted, but no actual malicious activity or payloads are present. Malware score remains at 0, obfuscation is high, and overall risk is low to moderate. Continued vigilance regarding input sanitization is recommended."

      "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet and analysis, there is no evidence of malicious behavior. The code appears to be a video processing utility with heavily obfuscated identifiers, which warrants caution but does not indicate malware. The malware score should remain at 0. The obfuscation score is high (~0.8), reflecting the suspicious naming. The security risk score is low (~0.3), but further review of the full project and external modules is recommended to ensure no hidden malicious components."
