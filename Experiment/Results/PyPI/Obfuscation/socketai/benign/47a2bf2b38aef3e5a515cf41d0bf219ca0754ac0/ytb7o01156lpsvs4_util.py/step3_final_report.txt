  "purpose": "System hardware detection by checking loaded kernel modules for 'i915' and 'nvidia' using subprocess to run 'lsmod'.",
  "sources": "Execution of 'lsmod' command via subprocess.run() and reading its stdout output.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only reads system info without transmitting or storing data externally.",
  "flows": "Source: subprocess.run() output -> parsing for 'i915' and 'nvidia' -> setting flags in dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable and function names; superficial obfuscation without malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code executes 'lsmod' to list loaded kernel modules, then searches for specific modules indicating hardware presence. No malicious payloads, external communication, or data exfiltration are present. Obfuscation is superficial, likely for concealment but not malicious. The subprocess call is standard and safe in this context. The logic is straightforward and benign, serving only hardware detection purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign hardware detection utility with superficial obfuscation. No malicious activity or security risks are evident. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
