  "purpose": "Detects hardware acceleration capabilities by checking loaded kernel modules.",
  "sources": "Reading output of 'lsmod' command via subprocess.run.",
  "sinks": "No data leaks or untrusted data effects; no external communication or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Input from 'lsmod' command processed and checked for specific module names, updating dictionary flags.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function and variable names; usage of subprocess without validation could be risky if combined with malicious inputs, but in this context, it's simply reading system info.",
  "analysis": "The code executes 'lsmod' to list loaded kernel modules, capturing the output. It then searches for specific modules 'i915' and 'nvidia' to set flags indicating hardware acceleration features. No external data inputs are processed, no data leaks, and no suspicious behavior. The code is straightforward and appears to serve a benign purpose of hardware detection. Obfuscated variable and function names suggest an attempt to conceal intent, but no malicious actions are evident. The subprocess call is standard for system info collection, and no command injection or insecure practices are observed in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple system hardware check using subprocess to run 'lsmod' and parse its output. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious intent. Obfuscation is superficial but not malicious. Overall, this code is benign and security-safe.",
