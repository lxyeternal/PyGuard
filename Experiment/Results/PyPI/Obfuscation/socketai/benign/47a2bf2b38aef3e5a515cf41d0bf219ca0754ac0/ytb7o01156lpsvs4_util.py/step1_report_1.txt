  "purpose": "The function checks for the presence of specific kernel modules related to hardware acceleration (Intel Quick Sync and Nvidia NVENC) on the system.",
  "sources": "Reads the output of the 'lsmod' command executed via subprocess.run()",
  "sinks": "The data retrieved from 'lsmod' is stored in variables but not used maliciously or transmitted externally.",
  "flows": "The subprocess.run() executes 'lsmod', and the output is parsed for specific strings to set boolean flags.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses obfuscated variable names which may obscure intent, but no malicious behavior such as data exfiltration or system modification is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code runs 'lsmod' to list loaded kernel modules. It searches the output for 'i915' and 'nvidia' to determine if certain hardware modules are loaded. Variable names are obfuscated, but the logic is straightforward and only involves querying system state. No data leakage, external communication, or malicious code is present. The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose of hardware detection, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a system information query with obfuscated variable names. It does not exhibit malicious activity or security risks, only querying kernel modules for hardware info. No malicious intent is detected.",
