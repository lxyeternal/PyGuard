  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate media processing utility with obfuscation that hampers readability but does not demonstrate malicious intent. The main security concern is potential command injection if inputs are untrusted, but no actual malicious activity or payloads are present. Malware score remains at 0, obfuscation is high, and overall risk is low to moderate. Continued vigilance regarding input sanitization is recommended."
