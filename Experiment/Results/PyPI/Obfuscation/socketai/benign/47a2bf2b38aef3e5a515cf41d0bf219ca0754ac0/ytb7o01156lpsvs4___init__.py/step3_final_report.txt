  "purpose": "Import statements from local modules with obfuscated names, likely part of a larger package.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing modules/classes with obfuscated or nonsensical names.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, network activity, or data leaks observed in this snippet.",
  "flows": "N/A — only import statements, no data flow or execution logic present.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated identifiers for imported modules/classes; no additional suspicious activity visible.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with obfuscated names, which could be an attempt to conceal functionality. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling is evident. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. Malware scores are low (0 or 0.2), aligning with the absence of concrete malicious behavior. Security risk scores are also low (~0.2), reflecting limited scope. Confidence in benign interpretation is moderate to high, but the obfuscation warrants caution. Without inspecting the imported modules, definitive conclusions cannot be made, but based on this snippet alone, the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is limited to obfuscated import statements with no active malicious behavior detected. Obfuscation alone does not confirm malicious intent but warrants further review of the imported modules. Scores are appropriately low, with high obfuscation indicating potential concealment but not necessarily malicious activity.",
