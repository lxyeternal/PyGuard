  "purpose": "Import various modules or functions from local package files, possibly for a multimedia processing or utility library.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local package modules",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks involving untrusted data or external communication; purely import statements",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis applicable as this code only imports modules/functions without executing or processing data",
  "anomalies": "Imported identifiers are obfuscated (e.g., uGZifnhYzfEAUOVnGBiAeZVoBdZIhGka), which could be an attempt to hide malicious intent. No other suspicious patterns or hardcoded credentials observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules, with obfuscated function and variable names. There is no execution of untrusted input, network activity, or other suspicious behavior. The obfuscation could be benign or malicious, but without additional context, it cannot be confirmed as malicious. No signs of malware, malicious data leaks, or malicious behavior are evident from these statements alone.",
  "conclusion": "This code is limited to importing local modules with obfuscated identifiers. While obfuscation can sometimes be used to hide malicious intent, there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior or malware in these import statements. Further analysis of the actual modules would be necessary for a definitive assessment.",
