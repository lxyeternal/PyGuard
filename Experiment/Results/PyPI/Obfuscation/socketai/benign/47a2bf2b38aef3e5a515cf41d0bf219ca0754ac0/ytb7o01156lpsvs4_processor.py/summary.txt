  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet and analysis, there is no evidence of malicious behavior. The code appears to be a video processing utility with heavily obfuscated identifiers, which warrants caution but does not indicate malware. The malware score should remain at 0. The obfuscation score is high (~0.8), reflecting the suspicious naming. The security risk score is low (~0.3), but further review of the full project and external modules is recommended to ensure no hidden malicious components."
