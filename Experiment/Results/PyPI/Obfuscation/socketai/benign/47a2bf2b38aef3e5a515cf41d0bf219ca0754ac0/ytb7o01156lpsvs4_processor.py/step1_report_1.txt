{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a data structure for processing video files, including loading, filtering, and processing video metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads input from 'self._file_map.contents', environment variables or external configuration via imported modules, and video files specified in the '_file_map'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive data processed or logged; however, there are no clear data leaks, network operations, or insecure handling of untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Input sources (video files) are loaded via FileMap, processed in 'QiyghVlIIlHOiloagsFpDbuOwkYONXeX', and results are stored in local variables and possibly logged.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated import names and class/method names (e.g., oDNwgDUWSCTZLXjfAuYGUswiHzCtvBjH), but no malicious code or backdoors are evident. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious external calls are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly handles video file processing with methods to load files, process their metadata, and filter based on size. Obfuscated names suggest either code minification or intentional hiding, but the logic itself is straightforward and does not perform any network activity, file modification, or data exfiltration. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling are observed. No use of dangerous functions like exec(), eval(), or insecure data handling is present. External modules like 'video_utils' and 'video_processor' are used, but their internal behavior is unknown and seem to relate to file and video processing. The logging statements are standard and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily for managing and processing a list of video files with no evident malicious activity or sabotage. Its obfuscated naming could indicate an attempt to hide functionality, but the logic appears benign. No malware, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are detected based on the visible code.",
