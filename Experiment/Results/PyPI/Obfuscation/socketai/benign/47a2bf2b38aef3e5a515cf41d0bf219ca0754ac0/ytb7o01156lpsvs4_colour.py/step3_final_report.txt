  "purpose": "Format a message string with terminal color codes based on a color name input.",
  "sources": "The color name parameter used as a key in the color mapping dictionary.",
  "sinks": "The returned string with embedded color codes; no external data sinks.",
  "flows": "Input color key -> dictionary lookup -> string concatenation with color codes -> output string.",
  "anomalies": "Lack of input validation for the color key; potential KeyError if invalid key provided.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility that maps a color name to a colorama Fore constant and returns the message wrapped with color codes. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or secret handling is present. Variable names are obfuscated but do not imply malicious intent. The only minor concern is the absence of input validation, which could cause runtime errors but not security vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for terminal message coloring with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The only improvement would be adding input validation for robustness, but this does not impact security. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, except for report 5's security risk score, which should be lowered to 0 to reflect the benign nature.",
