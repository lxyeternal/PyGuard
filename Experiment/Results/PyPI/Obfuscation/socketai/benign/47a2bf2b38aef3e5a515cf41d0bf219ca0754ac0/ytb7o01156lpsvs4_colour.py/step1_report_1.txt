{
  "purpose": "The function is designed to format a message string with a specified color for terminal output using the colorama library.",
  "sources": "The function reads the input parameters 'hHBVrjWwBOcBvQMVKgLoCSfTCCZLkIvH' (color name) and 'message' (the message to be formatted).",
  "sinks": "The code does not write to external files, send data over the network, or execute untrusted code. It only returns a colored string.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used directly to select a color and format the message, returning the colored string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are observed. The code uses a fixed mapping for colors and standard library functions without obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'colorama' and defines a function that applies terminal color formatting to a message based on the provided color name. The color is selected from a predefined dictionary, and the message is wrapped with color codes. There are no dynamic code executions, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious network or file operations. The logic is straightforward, and the function appears to serve a utility purpose for colored terminal output.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility for terminal message coloring with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It only formats messages for display, with no malicious side effects.",
