  "purpose": "Set and temporarily modify environment variables within a context.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'key' and 'value' provided to the context manager function.",
  "sinks": "Environment variable modification via os.environ, potentially affecting system-wide environment settings during the context.",
  "flows": "Input parameters 'key' and 'value' are used to set an environment variable; upon exiting the context, the environment variable is deleted.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors. The environment variable 'GOODCONF_TEST' is a benign string. No unusual code constructs or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a context manager that temporarily sets an environment variable using provided key and value parameters. It ensures cleanup by deleting the environment variable after the context. The hardcoded string 'GOODCONF_TEST' appears to be a placeholder or test value, not malicious. There are no external data sources, no network activity, no suspicious function calls, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The logic is standard for environment management and does not pose an immediate security risk.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a simple, benign utility for temporarily setting environment variables. There are no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It is unlikely to pose a security threat.",
