  "purpose": "Set and temporarily modify environment variables within a context manager.",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'key' and 'value' used to set environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Modifying os.environ, which influences environment variables for the process.",
  "flows": "Input parameters ('key' and 'value') are assigned to environment variables; environment variables are deleted after context.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or suspicious values; the code appears straightforward and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a context manager that temporarily sets an environment variable based on provided key and value, then removes it after exiting the context. It uses standard Python libraries os and contextlib, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. No data exfiltration, malicious commands, or backdoors are evident. It simply manages environment variables within a safe scope.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for managing environment variables temporarily. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks.",
