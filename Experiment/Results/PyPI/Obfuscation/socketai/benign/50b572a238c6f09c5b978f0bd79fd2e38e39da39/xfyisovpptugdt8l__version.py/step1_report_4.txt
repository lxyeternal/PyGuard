  "purpose": "Defines version information and type annotations, with conditional import logic.",
  "sources": "Reads the static string '6.1.2' and the boolean flag LxPoonvfpCrqiZpGrXAXemngNfalmvDm.",
  "sinks": "Assigns version information to variables; no untrusted data or external output appears.",
  "flows": "The code assigns hardcoded version info to variables, with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated-looking variable names and a seemingly meaningless boolean toggle; no real functionality or external interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes version variables, using an obfuscated boolean flag to conditionally import typing modules and define a type alias. The boolean is set to False, resulting in the type alias being set to 'object'. The version info is hardcoded as strings and tuples. There are no input sources, network calls, or dynamic behaviors. The variable names are intentionally obscure, but no malicious logic or hidden behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, containing only version info definitions with obfuscated variable names. There is no malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risk present. The obfuscation appears superficial, likely for code style or to deter casual reading.",
