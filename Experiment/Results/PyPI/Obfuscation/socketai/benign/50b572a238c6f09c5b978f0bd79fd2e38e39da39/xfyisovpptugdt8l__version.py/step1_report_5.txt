  "purpose": "Define version information for a Python package, with conditional type annotations.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version variables, conditional import statement.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no untrusted data processing or external communication.",
  "flows": "Variables 'version' and 'version_tuple' are assigned static values; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The variable 'LxPoonvfpCrqiZpGrXAXemngNfalmvDm' is a obfuscated, unused flag that controls a conditional import. No actual dynamic code execution or malicious patterns are present. The code appears intentionally obfuscated or placeholder-like but does not perform malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code declares version variables and a flag with an obfuscated name. The flag controls whether type annotations are imported and assigned, but the flag is set to False, so the import is skipped. The variables are assigned static version strings and tuples. There are no external data sources, no input handling, and no network operations. The obfuscation seems intentional but benign. No malicious or security-threatening behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version declaration with obfuscated variable names and a conditional import that is effectively disabled. It contains no malicious behavior, no external data handling, and no security risks. It appears to be intentionally obfuscated but benign.",
