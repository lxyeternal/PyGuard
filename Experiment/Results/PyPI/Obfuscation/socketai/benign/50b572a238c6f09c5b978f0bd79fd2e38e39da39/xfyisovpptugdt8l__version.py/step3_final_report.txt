{
  "purpose": "Defines version information with superficial obfuscation and conditional type hinting controlled by a static boolean flag.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version strings and tuples, static boolean flag controlling import statements.",
  "sinks": "None; no external input, data leakage, or malicious data handling present.",
  "flows": "Assignment of static version info; no dynamic or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Superficial obfuscation via nonsensical variable names; conditional import that is never executed due to static flag set to False.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns static version strings and tuples with obfuscated variable names, controlled by a static boolean flag that prevents execution of import statements. No external data, network activity, or dynamic behavior is present. The obfuscation appears superficial, likely for concealment rather than malicious intent. No malicious code, payloads, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The static flag ensures no runtime malicious behavior occurs. The code's purpose is benign, serving as a version info module with obfuscation for code concealment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated version info declaration with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The superficial obfuscation does not indicate malicious activity, and no external or dynamic threats are present.",
