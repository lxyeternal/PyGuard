  "purpose": "Define version information and conditionally import typing annotations based on a flag.",
  "sources": "The variable LxPoonvfpCrqiZpGrXAXemngNfalmvDm (hardcoded as False), and the assignments to version, version_tuple, and related variables.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted input; no I/O or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "No significant data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code assigns hardcoded version info to variables.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variable names (e.g., LxPoonvfpCrqiZpGrXAXemngNfalmvDm, eOZJqCryuwgALHUFwqWOjlQxpBfysoRF, IgvrUESSvFyXqDXdBuMxyLTQJknjMVFN), and a conditional import based on a boolean flag. The flag is hardcoded as False, making the conditional always bypass the import. No actual malicious activity, but unusual obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a list of export variables. It then sets a flag variable with a nonsensical name to False. Because the flag is always False, the import statements inside the conditional block are never executed; instead, a generic object is assigned to eOZJqCryuwgALHUFwqWOjlQxpBfysoRF. The variables version and version_tuple are assigned hardcoded version info. The obfuscated variable names suggest an attempt at hiding or obfuscation, but no malicious behavior or data manipulation is evident. The code appears to be benign but intentionally obfuscated, perhaps to hinder straightforward understanding.",
  "conclusion": "The code is obfuscated with nonsensical variable names and includes a conditional import that is never executed. It only assigns hardcoded version information without any malicious actions or data leaks. No malware or security risks are detected based on the provided snippet.",
