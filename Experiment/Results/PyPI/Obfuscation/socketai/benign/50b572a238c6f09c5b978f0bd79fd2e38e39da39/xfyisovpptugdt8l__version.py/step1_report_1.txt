  "purpose": "Define version information and related variables with an optional type hint based on a conditional flag.",
  "sources": "Read from the conditional flag 'LxPoonvfpCrqiZpGrXAXemngNfalmvDm', and the string assignments for 'version' and 'version_tuple'.",
  "sinks": "Assignments to 'version' and 'version_tuple'; no untrusted data sources or external data are used.",
  "flows": "Conditional branch setting 'eOZJqCryuwgALHUFwqWOjlQxpBfysoRF', then assignments to 'version' and 'version_tuple'.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variable names and a redundant conditional block, which could indicate an attempt to hide behavior; no malicious code actions are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines version information with obfuscated variable names. It uses a conditional flag that, if set to True, imports typing hints; otherwise, it assigns a generic object type. The flag is set to False, so the type hints are not used, and the variables 'version' and 'version_tuple' are straightforwardly assigned version info. The code appears to serve as a version descriptor with obfuscated elements, likely to obscure its purpose but no malicious actions are evident. No external data sources, network operations, or malicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily defines version variables with obfuscated naming and a conditional type hint setup, likely to complicate analysis. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks; it functions as a benign version descriptor with obfuscation but no malicious behavior.",
