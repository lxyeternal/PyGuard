  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- *Purpose & Sources:* Defines version info with optional type hints based on a flag.\n- *Analysis:* The code is obfuscated with nonsensical variable names. The conditional import is controlled by a flag set to False, so type hints are not used. No malicious actions or external data are involved.\n- *Conclusion:* Benign version info definition, obfuscated but no malicious intent.\n- *Scores:* malware=0, securityRisk=0.0 — consistent with analysis.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- *Purpose & Sources:* Similar to above, with obfuscated variable names and a static flag.\n- *Analysis:* The flag is always False; the conditional import is never executed. The code only assigns hardcoded version info. Obfuscation appears superficial.\n- *Conclusion:* No malicious activity, only obfuscated version info.\n- *Scores:* malware=0, securityRisk=0.1 — the slight securityRisk is acceptable due to obfuscation but no actual vulnerability.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- *Purpose & Sources:* Defines version info with obfuscated variable names and a static boolean flag.\n- *Analysis:* Same pattern: static flag set to False, no external data, no malicious code.\n- *Conclusion:* Obfuscated benign version info, no security issues.\n- *Scores:* malware=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- *Purpose & Sources:* Similar obfuscated version info with a conditional import controlled by a static boolean.\n- *Analysis:* No dynamic behavior, no external data, no malicious activity.\n- *Conclusion:* Obfuscated but benign version info.\n- *Scores:* malware=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- *Purpose & Sources:* Same pattern, obfuscated version info with a static flag.\n- *Analysis:* No external data, no malicious actions, just obfuscated code.\n- *Conclusion:* Benign, no security risk.\n- *Scores:* malware=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Observations:\n- All reports describe code that is heavily obfuscated with nonsensical variable names.\n- The conditional import based on a static boolean flag is never executed (flag is always False).\n- The code only assigns static version strings and tuples; no external data, network calls, or dynamic behaviors.\n- No evidence of malicious activity, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or payloads.\n- The obfuscation appears superficial, likely to hinder casual analysis but not indicative of malicious intent.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports, as no malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Slightly high (around 0.7) due to the deliberate obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0, as there are no security vulnerabilities or malicious actions.\n\n### Suggested scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.7\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code appears to be a benign, obfuscated version info module with no malicious or security concerns.",
