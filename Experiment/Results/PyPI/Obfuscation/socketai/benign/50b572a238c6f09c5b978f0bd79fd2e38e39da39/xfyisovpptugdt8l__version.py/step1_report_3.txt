  "purpose": "Define version information with an obfuscated conditional import and variable names.",
  "sources": "Reading the static variable LxPoonvfpCrqiZpGrXAXemngNfalmvDm to determine import behavior; assigning version strings and tuples.",
  "sinks": "Assignment of version strings and tuples, no untrusted data handling or external outputs.",
  "flows": "The control flow depends on the static boolean variable; no external data flow is present.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated variable names; conditional import that depends on a fixed boolean; no clear purpose for obfuscation or conditional logic. No secrets or malicious indicators are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines version-related variables with obfuscated names. It includes a fixed boolean flag that controls whether certain typing imports are used; however, the flag is statically set to False, so the imports are never executed. The code then assigns version information both as strings and tuples with standard values. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious code injection. The obfuscation appears to be intended for hiding simple version info definitions rather than malicious activity. Overall, the code is benign, with no suspicious network activity, data handling, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This code is primarily an obfuscated version info definition with no malicious intent or security risks detected. The obfuscation appears superficial, not serving any malicious purpose. No signs of malware or security vulnerabilities are present.",
