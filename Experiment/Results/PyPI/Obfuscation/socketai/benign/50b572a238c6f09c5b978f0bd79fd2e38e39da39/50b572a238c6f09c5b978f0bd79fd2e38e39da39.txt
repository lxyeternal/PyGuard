The use of internal modules and obfuscation warrants caution but does not constitute malware. Overall, it appears to be a legitimate, albeit complex, configuration utility. The malware score should be low but slightly elevated due to internal API usage and obfuscation, and the overall security risk remains low."

The assigned scores are justified and consistent with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary. The supply chain risk remains low to moderate, primarily driven by the suspicious patterns in Report 2."
