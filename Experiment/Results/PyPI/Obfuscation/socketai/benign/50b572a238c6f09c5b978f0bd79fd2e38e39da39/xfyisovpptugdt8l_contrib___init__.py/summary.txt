  "conclusion": "The overall code appears benign across the majority of reports, with only Report 2 indicating significant malicious behavior. The assigned scores are justified and consistent with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary. The supply chain risk remains low to moderate, primarily driven by the suspicious patterns in Report 2."
