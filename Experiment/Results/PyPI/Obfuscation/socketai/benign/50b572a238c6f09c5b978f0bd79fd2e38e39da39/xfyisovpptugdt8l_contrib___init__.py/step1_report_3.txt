  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for performing a specific task, potentially involving data processing or network communication. However, the exact purpose is unclear without further context.",
  "sources": "Input is read from environment variables, function parameters, or possibly external data sources such as files or network sockets.",
  "sinks": "Data could be sent over network connections, written to files, or used in subprocess calls. Specific sink points include network send functions, file write operations, or system commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources like environment variables or inputs through processing functions, potentially reaching network or file output sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of dynamically constructed code execution, obfuscated variable names, or unusual imports may indicate suspicious behavior. Hardcoded credentials or URLs, if any, are notable.",
  "analysis": "The code contains standard imports and function definitions. No obvious malicious activity such as network connections to suspicious domains, data exfiltration, or system damage is directly observable. The code's structure suggests typical data handling, but without explicit details, some parts remain ambiguous. The absence of obvious hardcoded secrets or backdoors reduces suspicion, but the use of dynamic code execution or obfuscated patterns requires caution. Overall, no clear malicious intent or malware patterns are identified. The code may perform benign functions, but incomplete context limits certainty.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evident malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to perform routine data processing tasks, with no suspicious network activity, backdoors, or malware indicators observed. Confidence in this assessment is moderate due to limited context and potential obfuscation.",
