  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks, focusing on supply chain threats, code injection, data leakage, and obfuscation.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, user inputs, files, network data, and potentially embedded strings or code snippets.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, subprocess calls, environment variable access, and data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as inputs or environment variables to sinks like network transmissions, file outputs, or code execution points.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded credentials, eval/exec usage, suspicious network activity, obfuscation, misleading variable names, or dynamic code execution patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed for malicious patterns, suspicious data flows, and obfuscation. No active malicious payloads or backdoors were identified. Report 2 indicated high suspicion with hardcoded secrets, eval/exec, and obfuscated strings, justifying high malware (0.85) and obfuscation (0.8) scores. Other reports showed benign or placeholder code with no suspicious activity, supporting low malware (0) and obfuscation (0) scores. Security risk scores varied accordingly, with higher in Report 2 due to malicious indicators. Confidence levels were consistent with the evidence; the overall assessment aligns with the described behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The overall code appears benign across the majority of reports, with only Report 2 indicating significant malicious behavior. The assigned scores are justified and consistent with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary. The supply chain risk remains low to moderate, primarily driven by the suspicious patterns in Report 2.",
