  "conclusion": "Most code snippets are benign with low security risk. Report 4's obfuscation and suspicion are justified, warranting cautious monitoring. The overall malware score should remain low (~0.2-0.3), with obfuscation around 0.2-0.3, and risk around 0.2-0.3. No significant issues are detected; the assessments are consistent and appropriate."
