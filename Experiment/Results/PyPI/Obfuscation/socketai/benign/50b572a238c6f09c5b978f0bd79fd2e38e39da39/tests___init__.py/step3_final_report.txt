  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, input variables, potential system/network calls, dynamic code segments.",
  "sinks": "System commands, network communication, environment variable access, file operations.",
  "flows": "Input sources (variables/env) to sinks via data processing functions, possibly leading to malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated code, dynamic execution, minimal comments, inconsistent or suspicious patterns, potential hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets are mostly straightforward, with no evidence of obfuscation, malicious activity, or suspicious data flows. Reports 1-3 and 5 describe benign code with high confidence, low malware, and low obfuscation scores. Report 4 indicates obfuscation and dynamic execution, raising suspicion, justified by higher obfuscated (0.8) and malware (0.4) scores. The incomplete code in report 5 limits certainty but aligns with low suspicion. Overall, the scores are consistent with the described code characteristics, with the exception of report 4's suspicion justifying its higher scores.",
  "conclusion": "Most code snippets are benign with low security risk. Report 4's obfuscation and suspicion are justified, warranting cautious monitoring. The overall malware score should remain low (~0.2-0.3), with obfuscation around 0.2-0.3, and risk around 0.2-0.3. No significant issues are detected; the assessments are consistent and appropriate.",
