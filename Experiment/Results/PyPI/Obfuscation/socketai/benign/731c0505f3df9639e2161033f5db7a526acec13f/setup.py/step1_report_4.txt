{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'torch_runstats' Python package, used for installing the package and its metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading version information from '_version.py', reading 'README.md' file, and package setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "No evident untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or external system commands are executed.",
  "flows": "Version info is loaded from a local file; no flow of untrusted data to dangerous sinks is apparent.",
  "anomalies": "The variable names are obfuscated or nonsensical, possibly to hide intent. The use of dynamic exec to load version info from a local file is unconventional but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code loads version information by executing a local Python file, then reads a README file for long description. The setup parameters are standard, albeit with obfuscated variable names. No network activity, external commands, or sensitive data handling is present. The obfuscation of variable names and use of exec could be considered suspicious but are not definitive signs of malicious intent. Overall, the script appears to be a standard package setup with minor obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package, with obfuscated variable names and use of exec, which are unusual but not malicious. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
