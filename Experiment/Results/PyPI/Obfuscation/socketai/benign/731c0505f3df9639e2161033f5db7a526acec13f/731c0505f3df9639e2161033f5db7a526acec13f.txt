      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign setup script with superficial obfuscation and dynamic version loading. No evidence of malicious activity or supply chain compromise is detected. The use of exec() warrants caution but is standard in such contexts. The scores are justified and align with the analysis."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be complex tensor manipulation code with heavy obfuscation. There is no concrete evidence of malicious activity such as data theft, network communication, or system compromise. The obfuscation warrants caution, but in isolation, it is more likely to be complex, obfuscated legitimate code rather than malware."

      "conclusion": "The code functions as a legitimate statistical tensor utility with significant obfuscation. No evidence of malicious behavior or external sabotage is present. The primary concern is obfuscation, which could hinder review but does not indicate active malicious intent."

      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code fragment shows high obfuscation and inconsistent __all__ entries but no direct evidence of malicious activity. The low malware score is appropriate; the high obfuscation score reflects suspicion. The overall security risk remains moderate due to obfuscation and potential missing definitions, warranting further review of imported modules and code completeness."
