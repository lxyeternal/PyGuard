{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up module exports and import specific components from internal modules, likely for a Python package.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (_version, _runstats, KohQcnnDillgolXrzEFyLbTVTvGWZtps).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "The module imports data from internal modules and exposes selected names via __all__, but no data flow from external sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated internal module names (e.g., _version, _runstats, KohQcnnDillgolXrzEFyLbTVTvGWZtps). The obfuscated names could be an attempt to conceal malicious or unwanted behavior. However, these are only import statements and do not necessarily indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles module setup by importing specific components and defining __all__ for export. The use of obfuscated internal module names is unusual and could be an attempt to hide functionality. No evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious code execution is present. The code does not contain hardcoded credentials, network activity, or code execution that suggests malicious intent. The obfuscation is suspicious but not definitively malicious based solely on these statements.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet appears to be standard module setup code with obfuscated internal module names. There is no direct evidence of malicious activity or security risks in this fragment, though the obfuscation warrants further review of the actual internal modules.",
