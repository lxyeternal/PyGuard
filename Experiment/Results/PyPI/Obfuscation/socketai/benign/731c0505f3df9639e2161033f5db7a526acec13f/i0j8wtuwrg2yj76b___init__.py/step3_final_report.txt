  "purpose": "Module setup with obfuscated internal imports and export definitions",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules with obfuscated names; __all__ declaration",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external communication observed",
  "flows": "Import statements and __all__ list referencing potentially undefined symbols",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated identifiers; 'Reduction' included in __all__ but not imported or defined; 'scatter' in __all__ without definition",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with obfuscated module and variable names, and an __all__ list that includes 'Reduction' and 'scatter' which are not defined in this snippet. No active code, data flow, or external communication is present. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. The missing definitions for 'Reduction' and 'scatter' could cause runtime errors, indicating incomplete or improperly structured code. The scores assigned in the reports (malware around 0.2, obfuscation around 0.7-0.8, risk around 0.3-0.4) are consistent with the observed obfuscation but lack evidence of malicious activity. The primary concern is the obfuscation and potential incomplete code, not active malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code fragment shows high obfuscation and inconsistent __all__ entries but no direct evidence of malicious activity. The low malware score is appropriate; the high obfuscation score reflects suspicion. The overall security risk remains moderate due to obfuscation and potential missing definitions, warranting further review of imported modules and code completeness.",
