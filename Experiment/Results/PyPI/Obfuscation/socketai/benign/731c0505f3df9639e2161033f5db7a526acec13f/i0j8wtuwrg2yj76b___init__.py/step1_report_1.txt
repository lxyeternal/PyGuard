{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define module exports, importing specific components from internal modules and setting __all__ for public API exposure.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules: ._version, ._runstats, and .",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no data is processed or transmitted beyond internal imports and export definitions.",
  "flows": "No external data flow; module imports and exports only.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated names such as ILsdxWXLtcCehjgdSSCmmwTmBHtukPkC and KohQcnnDillgolXrzEFyLbTVTvGWZtps; the import of a module with a non-descriptive name; __all__ includes 'scatter' without clear context; no visible code logic or execution beyond imports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports internal components with highly obfuscated names, which could be an attempt to hide malicious or unintended behavior. The presence of a module named 'scatter' in __all__ suggests an intention to expose certain functionalities, but without the actual implementation, it is unclear what 'scatter' does. The obfuscated identifiers and minimal structure raise suspicion but do not explicitly demonstrate malicious activity. No external network calls, file operations, or data manipulations are visible. The code primarily sets up the module's public interface.",
  "conclusion": "The code's main concern is the use of obfuscated identifiers and the minimal, opaque import structure, which could be used to hide malicious code. However, based solely on this fragment, there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior. The security risk appears low, but the obfuscation warrants caution, and further review of the imported modules is recommended.",
