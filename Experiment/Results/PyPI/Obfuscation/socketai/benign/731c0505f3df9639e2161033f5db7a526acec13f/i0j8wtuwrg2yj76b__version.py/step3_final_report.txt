{
  "purpose": "Assign a version string to an obfuscated variable name, likely for configuration or version tracking.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it is a static assignment.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows are present.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code is a simple assignment.",
  "anomalies": "The variable name is obfuscated, which could be suspicious, but the assigned value is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static assignment of a version string to an obfuscated variable name. No malicious code, data leaks, or external interactions are present. The obfuscation may be intentional but does not imply malicious intent. The scores from the reports correctly reflect this: malware score of 0, high obfuscation score (~0.8), and very low security risk (~0.1). The confidence levels are appropriate given the simplicity of the code. Overall, the code is benign, and the obfuscation alone does not constitute a security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign, with obfuscation but no malicious activity. The scores are consistent with this assessment. No further action or adjustment is necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.8,
