  "purpose": "Assigning a version string to a variable, likely for package versioning or configuration.",
  "sources": "The code assigns a static string to a variable.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or external interactions occur.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow paths identified.",
  "anomalies": "Variable name appears obfuscated or nonsensical, which is unusual. The variable name 'ILsdxWXLtcCehjgdSSCmmwTmBHtukPkC' is not meaningful and may be an attempt to hide intent. The value '0.2.0' is a common version string, but combined with the obscure variable name, it suggests obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single variable assignment with an obfuscated variable name and a typical version string. There are no input sources, external calls, or data flows. The obfuscated variable name might indicate an attempt to hide its purpose or be part of a larger obfuscated codebase. The simple assignment itself does not indicate malicious behavior. No suspicious behaviors or malicious patterns are evident from this isolated snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign assignment of a version string to an obfuscated variable name. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leaks, or malicious behaviors in this isolated code fragment.",
