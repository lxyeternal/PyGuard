  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, logical consistency, and scoring justification.\n\n**Report 1**:\n- The code only imports a class; no data flows, sinks, or anomalies are present.\n- The conclusion states the code is benign, which aligns with the minimal snippet.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment**: Fully reasonable. No issues here.\n\n**Report 2**:\n- Similar minimal import; no data flows or suspicious activity.\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.8) and a small securityRisk (0.2), perhaps reflecting awareness that package source should be verified.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n- **Assessment**: Reasonable. The package source should be verified, but the code itself is safe.\n\n**Report 3**:\n- Same pattern; import only, no suspicious behavior.\n- Slightly higher confidence (0.8) and lower securityRisk (0.1).\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n- **Assessment**: Consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Report 4**:\n- Again, only an import; no anomalies or suspicious activity.\n- Confidence is high (0.9), securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment**: Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5**:\n- Same minimal import, no issues.\n- High confidence (0.9), zero security risk.\n- **Assessment**: Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### General observations:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or suspicious activity.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the minimal code snippet.\n- The small securityRisk scores reflect the need to verify package integrity but do not indicate actual issues.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- Since the code is just an import statement, the malware score should remain at 0 unless there's evidence of malicious package behavior, which isn't provided here.\n- Obfuscated should stay at 0; no obfuscation is present.\n- The risk scores are appropriately low, given the limited context.\n\n### Final overall assessment:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score**: 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting the importance of verifying third-party package sources but not indicating an active security risk.\n\n**Summary**: The reports are accurate, and the scores are reasonable given the minimal code snippet. No changes are necessary.",
