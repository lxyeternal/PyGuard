{
  "purpose": "Importing the SocialPost class from the ayrshare.ayrshare package, likely for social media automation.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no data input or external sources within this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could leak information.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink flows; the code only imports a class without executing further logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; the code is a straightforward import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal import of a class from a third-party package. No data handling, network activity, or suspicious behavior is present. The scores for malware and obfuscation are correctly zero. The security risk score could be lowered to zero, as the import alone does not pose any threat. The confidence in benignity is high due to the simplicity and lack of suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are appropriate, but the security risk score should be adjusted to 0 for a more accurate reflection of its safety.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
  "model": "gpt-4.1-nano"
