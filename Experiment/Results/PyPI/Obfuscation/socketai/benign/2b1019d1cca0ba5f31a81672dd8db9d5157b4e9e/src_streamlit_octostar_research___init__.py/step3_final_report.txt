  "purpose": "Analysis of supply chain security and malicious behavior in Python packages, focusing on code features such as eval/exec, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, and data flows.",
  "sources": "Untrusted input sources such as environment variables, user inputs, network data, or files.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic evaluation functions (eval, exec), network connections, file modifications, system commands, or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into evaluation functions, network calls, or system commands, potentially leading to malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval()/exec() on untrusted data, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The reports generally identify the absence of code or benign behavior correctly. Report 4 highlights eval()/exec() usage, which is a significant security concern, justifying increased malware and risk scores. Other reports correctly assign low scores due to lack of suspicious activity. The reasoning aligns with the evidence, though the malware score for report 4 should be increased to reflect the high risk associated with dynamic code execution. Confidence levels are appropriate, and no obfuscation is detected across reports. Overall, the scores are consistent with the described code features, with the main adjustment needed in report 4.",
  "conclusion": "The main security concern is the use of eval()/exec() in report 4, which warrants elevating the malware score to 0.6 and the security risk to 0.5. Other reports are appropriately scored as benign. The analysis confirms that the overall security posture is low risk, except for the highlighted dynamic evaluation, which increases potential danger.",
