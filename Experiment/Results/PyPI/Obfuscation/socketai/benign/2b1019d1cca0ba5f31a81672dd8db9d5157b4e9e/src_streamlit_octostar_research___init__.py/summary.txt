  "conclusion": "The main security concern is the use of eval()/exec() in report 4, which warrants elevating the malware score to 0.6 and the security risk to 0.5. Other reports are appropriately scored as benign. The analysis confirms that the overall security posture is low risk, except for the highlighted dynamic evaluation, which increases potential danger."
