{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a custom Streamlit component by specifying a frontend directory and declaring the component.",
  "sources": "Reading the __file__ attribute to determine the current script's directory; using the 'components.declare_component' function with the path to the frontend directory.",
  "sinks": "The 'components.declare_component' function, which may load or initialize external frontend code, but no direct sinks for untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "Path calculation from __file__ to the frontend directory, then passing this path to 'declare_component'. No data flow involving untrusted input is apparent.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names (e.g., JJsJekhNOcePfTfSvZceuejjZxESNdYm) that do not convey meaning; no clear handling of user input or sensitive data; the code's purpose is straightforward setup without any suspicious or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code calculates the absolute path to a 'frontend' directory relative to the current file and uses it to declare a custom Streamlit component. There are no input sources that could be malicious, no use of untrusted data, and no code that interacts with external systems in a suspicious manner. The variable names are obfuscated but do not indicate malicious intent; they seem to serve as placeholders or deliberately obscure identifiers. The overall structure is consistent with typical setup code for Streamlit custom components.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup for a Streamlit custom component with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscated variable names do not suggest malicious intent but reduce code clarity. There are no data leaks, backdoors, or malicious payloads present.",
