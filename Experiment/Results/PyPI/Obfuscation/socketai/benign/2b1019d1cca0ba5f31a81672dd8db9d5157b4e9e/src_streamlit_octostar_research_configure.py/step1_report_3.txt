  "purpose": "Define a Streamlit component that loads a frontend from a local directory for use within a Streamlit app.",
  "sources": "Reading the __file__ attribute to locate the 'frontend' directory",
  "sinks": "Passing the path of the frontend directory to the Streamlit components declaration, which could potentially load frontend assets or scripts",
  "flows": "Path(__file__).parent / 'frontend' -> absolute() -> str() -> components.declare_component()",
  "anomalies": "Use of obscure variable names; no clear indication of malicious code; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious behavior; reliance on local files for frontend assets is typical for custom components",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and constructs a path to a 'frontend' directory relative to the current script. It then declares a Streamlit custom component using that path. The code appears to set up a frontend component, which is a common pattern in Streamlit for integrating custom JavaScript or HTML. No signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, network communication, or obfuscated code. Variable names are intentionally obscure but do not indicate malicious intent. Overall, this seems like standard setup code for a custom Streamlit component.",
  "conclusion": "The code simply sets up a custom Streamlit component pointing to a local frontend directory. No malicious behavior or security issues are evident.",
