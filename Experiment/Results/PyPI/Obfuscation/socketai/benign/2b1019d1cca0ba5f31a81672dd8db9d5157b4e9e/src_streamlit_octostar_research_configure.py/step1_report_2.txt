{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a custom Streamlit component for a web application, loading frontend resources from a specified directory.",
  "sources": "__file__ (filesystem path), Path(__file__).parent / 'frontend' (filesystem path), components.declare_component (module function call)",
  "sinks": "components.declare_component (potentially loads external frontend resources)",
  "flows": "Path(__file__) -> Path(parent directory) -> frontend directory; declare_component loads resources from the specified path",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or malicious code detected. Variable names are obfuscated but do not appear malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries and a Streamlit module, then defines a directory path for frontend assets. It uses 'declare_component' to create a custom component, which is typical for Streamlit apps. No data input/output, user data, or network communication is present. Obfuscated variable names are likely for naming consistency or obfuscation but do not suggest malicious intent. There are no code injections, external data leaks, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard setup for a Streamlit custom component. No malicious or suspicious behavior identified. It simply loads frontend assets for use in a Streamlit app.",
