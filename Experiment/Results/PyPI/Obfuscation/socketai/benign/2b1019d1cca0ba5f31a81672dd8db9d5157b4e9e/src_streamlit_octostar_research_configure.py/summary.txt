  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate setup code for a custom Streamlit component, with obfuscated variable names that do not indicate malicious intent. There are no signs of malware or security vulnerabilities. The overall security risk is very low, and the malware score should remain at 0. Obfuscation alone is not sufficient to assign a high maliciousness score. The code is safe and typical for its purpose."
