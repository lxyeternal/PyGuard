{
  "purpose": "This code sets up a custom Streamlit component by declaring a component and specifying its path relative to the current file.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current file path (__file__) and constructs a path to a 'frontend' directory.",
  "sinks": "The path to the frontend directory is passed to 'components.declare_component', which loads the component from that directory.",
  "flows": "The code reads the __file__ path and constructs a directory path, then passes this path to the declare_component function.",
  "anomalies": "The variable names appear obfuscated with random characters, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials, no network activity, or suspicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules for path handling and streamlit components, then constructs an absolute path to a 'frontend' directory relative to the current script. It then declares a custom Streamlit component using this path. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors such as network calls, data leaks, or obfuscated malicious code. The variable names are unusual but do not indicate malicious intent, possibly obfuscation or code generation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup for a custom Streamlit component, with no signs of malicious behavior. The obfuscated variable names are suspicious but do not constitute malicious activity on their own.",
