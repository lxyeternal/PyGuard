  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code simply constructs a path to a 'frontend' directory and declares a custom component. No malicious activity, data leaks, or code injection.\n- **Errors/flaws:** The variable names are obfuscated, which is unusual but not malicious. The report correctly notes the lack of user input or network activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.1, obfuscated = 0.7, confidence = 0.9. These seem reasonable; obfuscation is high but not suspicious enough to warrant a higher malware score.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid setup code, no security issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above, standard pattern for loading frontend assets.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues detected; obfuscation is minimal.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.1, obfuscated = 0.2. Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same pattern, no malicious activity.\n- **Errors/flaws:** Obfuscated variable names but no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.2, obfuscated = 0.2. Consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate setup code.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above.\n- **Errors/flaws:** Obfuscation noted but no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.2, obfuscated = 0.5. Slightly higher obfuscation but not necessarily malicious.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same pattern.\n- **Errors/flaws:** Obfuscated variable names, but no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.1, obfuscated = 0.8. High obfuscation, but that alone isn't malicious.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Ranges from 0.2 to 0.8, reflecting variable name obfuscation. While obfuscation can sometimes be suspicious, in this context, it appears to be a code-generation or naming style choice, not malicious.\n- **Risk score:** Very low (0.1-0.2), appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The code is straightforward setup code for a custom Streamlit component.\n- No signs of malware, malicious intent, or security vulnerabilities.\n- Obfuscation is noted but not necessarily malicious; it might be auto-generated variable names.\n\n### My estimated scores:\n- **Malware:** 0.0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.6 (variable names are obfuscated but not suspicious)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (low risk, standard setup code)\n\n**Summary:** The code appears legitimate, with obfuscation being the only somewhat suspicious aspect, but not enough to raise the risk score.",
