{
  "purpose": "This code constructs an absolute path to a 'frontend' directory relative to the current script and declares a custom Streamlit component using that path.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current file's directory (__file__), constructs a path to the 'frontend' directory, and passes it to declare_component.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks; the code does not process user input, perform network operations, or handle sensitive data.",
  "flows": "The source is the path construction (__file__ and Path), which flows into the declare_component function as a string argument.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are obfuscated or randomly generated, which is unusual but not malicious. No other anomalies are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup for a custom Streamlit component, referencing a local 'frontend' directory. No signs of malicious activity, such as network calls, data leaks, or code injection, are present. Obfuscated variable names are noted but likely due to code generation or naming conventions, not malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, low security risk, high obfuscation) are consistent with benign code. No vulnerabilities or malicious payloads are detected. The obfuscation does not inherently imply malicious behavior, and the code's purpose is clear and limited to component registration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate setup code for a custom Streamlit component, with obfuscated variable names that do not indicate malicious intent. There are no signs of malware or security vulnerabilities. The overall security risk is very low, and the malware score should remain at 0. Obfuscation alone is not sufficient to assign a high maliciousness score. The code is safe and typical for its purpose.",
