{
  "purpose": "To define a custom Streamlit component that loads frontend assets from a specific directory.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __file__ attribute to determine the script's directory and uses it to locate the 'frontend' folder.",
  "sinks": "The code passes the directory path as a string to 'declare_component', which could be used to serve frontend assets.",
  "flows": "Path(__file__).parent / 'frontend' -> absolute path -> string conversion -> declare_component with path",
  "anomalies": "The variable names are obfuscated or randomly generated, which is unusual and can be suspicious. The code only handles static paths and does not process untrusted input.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules for filesystem path handling, typing, and Streamlit components. It constructs an absolute path to a 'frontend' directory relative to the current script. This path is then used to declare a custom Streamlit component. No user input, network connections, or data processing occurs. The obfuscated variable names are unusual but not inherently malicious. The code appears to be part of a larger setup for loading frontend resources, typical in custom Streamlit components. There are no signs of data leakage, code injection, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup for a custom Streamlit component, with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be legitimate application code for loading frontend assets.",
