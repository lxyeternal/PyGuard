Other reports are appropriately scored as benign. The analysis confirms that the overall security posture is low risk, except for the highlighted dynamic evaluation, which increases potential danger."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is legitimate setup code for a custom Streamlit component, with obfuscated variable names that do not indicate malicious intent. There are no signs of malware or security vulnerabilities. The overall security risk is very low, and the malware score should remain at 0. Obfuscation alone is not sufficient to assign a high maliciousness score. The code is safe and typical for its purpose."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of a context menu component with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The main security consideration is the reliance on external parent window functions, which should be trusted. The undefined 'component_id' is a bug that should be fixed for stability but does not impact security."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of a custom Streamlit component for search functionality, interacting with an external 'octostar' system. No malicious activity, backdoors, or malware are evident. The main issues are incomplete variable definitions that could cause runtime errors but do not pose security risks. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score is zero."

The primary concerns are external dependencies and obfuscation, which could be exploited if compromised, but within this code, no malicious intent is evident."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code functions as wrapper interfaces with external components, with obfuscated naming but no direct evidence of malicious activity. The risk and malware scores are appropriately low, considering the obfuscation and external invocation. Continued validation of the external component's behavior is recommended, but based solely on this snippet, the code appears safe."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of obfuscated API wrappers for managing workspaces and remote app interactions. While obfuscation and remote invocation capabilities warrant cautious handling, static analysis does not reveal active malicious behavior. Continuous monitoring and validation of external components are recommended."

      "conclusion": "The code functions as API wrappers for ontology operations with moderate obfuscation and key-based access control. No malicious activity or supply chain sabotage signs are present. The low malware and risk scores are justified, though obfuscation warrants cautious review in the full system context."
