  "purpose": "Generate a custom context menu component in a Streamlit application with embedded HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'item' parameter (data input), and the 'label' parameter. It also accesses 'component_id' (although it is not defined in the provided snippet). It manipulates DOM elements and communicates with the parent window.",
  "sinks": "JavaScript functions that call 'window.parent.octostar.call' with context menu request data, which could potentially send data to parent window.",
  "flows": "Input data ('item') is injected into the HTML/JavaScript as JSON; events like 'mouseenter' and 'contextmenu' trigger 'handleMouseEvent', which computes coordinates and sends a request to parent window via 'octostar.call'.",
  "anomalies": "The variable 'component_id' is used but not defined, indicating a possible missing piece. The script dynamically serializes 'item' as JSON, which is standard, but if 'item' contains malicious content, it could lead to injection issues. The code dynamically calls 'octostar.call' without validation, potentially enabling data exfiltration if the parent window is malicious or compromised.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs an HTML page with embedded JavaScript to handle context menu interactions. It serializes 'item' into JavaScript directly via 'json.dumps', which is generally safe but depends on 'item' content. The event handlers are standard for context menus and hover events, adjusting for iframe nesting to get correct coordinates. The 'window.parent.octostar.call' is a communication mechanism; if the parent window is malicious, it could misuse this data. There is no evidence of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code like network exfiltration, data theft, or reverse shells. The use of 'component_id' without definition is a potential bug but not malicious. Overall, the code appears to be a typical component for context menus with no direct malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a Streamlit component for context menus, dynamically generating HTML/JS. While it involves cross-window communication, there is no evident malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The main concern is reliance on parent window 'octostar.call', which, if the parent is malicious, could misuse the data. No malware or obfuscation detected. The overall security risk appears low.",
