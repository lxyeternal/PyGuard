  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package 'streamlit-octostar-research' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file content from the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external calls observed.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md content -> passing it as long_description in setup()",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names; no hardcoded credentials or malicious code evident; no suspicious network or system operations.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup operations: defining paths, reading a markdown file for the description, and configuring package metadata with setuptools. All operations are typical for a package setup script. The variable names are intentionally obfuscated but do not influence functionality or security. No external or network calls are made, and no suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a standard Python package setup with obfuscated variable names but no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
