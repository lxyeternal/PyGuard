{
  "purpose": "A standard Python package setup script that reads README.md for long description and configures package metadata using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file from the package directory.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external network or data exfiltration points present.",
  "flows": "Reads local file content into a variable, then passes it to setuptools.setup() as long_description.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names that do not affect functionality but suggest concealment; no malicious code or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with obfuscated variable names. It reads a local README.md file and invokes setuptools.setup() with package metadata. No network activity, code injection, or malicious logic is present. The obfuscation appears to be solely in variable naming, not in code behavior. No external data handling or dynamic code execution is observed. Given the benign nature of the code, the malware score is set to 0. The obfuscation score is high (~0.8) due to variable naming, but this does not imply malicious intent. The security risk score remains very low (~0.1), consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malware or malicious behavior. The obfuscation is likely superficial and does not impact security. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
