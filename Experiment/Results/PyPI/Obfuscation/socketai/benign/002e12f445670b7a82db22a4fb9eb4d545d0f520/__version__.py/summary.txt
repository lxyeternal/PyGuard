  "conclusion": "Most reports indicate benign code with appropriate low risk scores. Report 2 warrants cautious attention due to obfuscation and dynamic execution signs, with a slightly elevated malware score. Minor score adjustment for Report 2's malware score from 0.4 to 0.3 could be considered for conservativeness, but current scores are acceptable. No definitive malicious activity is confirmed, and the overall assessment remains low risk."
