  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code reading input data, environment variables, dynamic code execution functions like eval/exec.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, system modifications, network communications, or code injection points.",
  "flows": "From source points such as input or environment variables to sinks like eval/exec or network calls.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, missing or empty code snippets, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious control flow.",
  "analysis": "The code appears benign with no obfuscation or malicious indicators in the majority of reports. Report 2 shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, raising suspicion but lacking concrete malicious payloads. The scores assigned reflect these observations: low malware and obfuscation in benign reports, moderate suspicion in Report 2. The security risk scores are consistent with the suspicion levels, with the highest in Report 2. Confidence levels align with the evidence; no false positives are indicated. Overall, the assessments are consistent and justified based on the provided descriptions.",
  "conclusion": "Most reports indicate benign code with appropriate low risk scores. Report 2 warrants cautious attention due to obfuscation and dynamic execution signs, with a slightly elevated malware score. Minor score adjustment for Report 2's malware score from 0.4 to 0.3 could be considered for conservativeness, but current scores are acceptable. No definitive malicious activity is confirmed, and the overall assessment remains low risk.",
