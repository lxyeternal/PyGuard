  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script designed to perform specific tasks, possibly related to data processing or system operations.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables and potentially file reads or network data if present (not explicitly shown).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, network requests, file writes, or data output mechanisms.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources like environment variables or inputs to sinks such as network functions, file operations, or system commands.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are detected. No unusual imports or code patterns indicating malicious intent. The structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script's structure was reviewed thoroughly. It uses common Python modules and functions, with no signs of malicious obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration or system tampering. All third-party modules are standard and used appropriately. No hardcoded secrets or malicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a benign, standard Python script. However, this conclusion is based solely on the visible code snippet and does not account for external dependencies or runtime behavior.",
