  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, input functions, dynamic execution functions (eval/exec), hardcoded strings, network or file sinks.",
  "sinks": "Potential network connections, file writes, environment variable access, dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input or environment variables may flow into eval/exec or network functions, potentially leading to malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscation, dynamic execution, suspicious strings, inconsistent control flow, or hardcoded credentials.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits typical benign patterns in most reports, with low malware and obfuscation scores. Report 2 shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, justifying higher suspicion. Report 4 shows moderate suspicion due to obfuscation but no confirmed malicious activity. The overall pattern indicates most code is safe, with some snippets warranting caution due to obfuscation and dynamic features.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with low malware risk; however, suspicious features like obfuscation and dynamic execution in some snippets justify moderate concern. The scores are consistent with the observed patterns, with Report 2 being the most suspicious. No definitive malicious activity is confirmed, but vigilance is advised.",
