  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with low malware risk; however, suspicious features like obfuscation and dynamic execution in some snippets justify moderate concern. The scores are consistent with the observed patterns, with Report 2 being the most suspicious. No definitive malicious activity is confirmed, but vigilance is advised."
