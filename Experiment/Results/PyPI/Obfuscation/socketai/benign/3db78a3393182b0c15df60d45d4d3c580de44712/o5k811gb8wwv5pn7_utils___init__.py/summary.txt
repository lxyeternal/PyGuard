  "conclusion": "The code shows moderate to high suspicion of malicious intent, primarily driven by obfuscation and dynamic execution patterns. The most suspicious report (Report 3) justifies higher malware and risk scores. Overall, scores should be adjusted upward for better accuracy, especially in Report 1, to reflect the suspicious features. The rest are consistent with their analyses."
