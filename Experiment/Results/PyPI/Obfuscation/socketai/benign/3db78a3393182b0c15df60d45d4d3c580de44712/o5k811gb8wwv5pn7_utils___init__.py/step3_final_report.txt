  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code sections involving dynamic import, eval, exec, network communication, and obfuscated constructs.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks via network, dynamic code execution points, external URL references, and environment variables.",
  "flows": "Sources such as obfuscated code and dynamic imports lead to sinks like network communication and eval/exec execution points.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation score (0.7), suspicion of dynamic execution, external URL references, and lack of code clarity.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are typical in malicious scripts. The suspicious network activity and external references further elevate concern. The high obfuscation (0.7) and malware (0.2) scores in initial reports underestimate the suspicion; adjusting malware to around 0.6 and risk to approximately 0.6-0.7 better reflect the evidence. Reports with no code or benign patterns maintain low scores consistent with their analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows moderate to high suspicion of malicious intent, primarily driven by obfuscation and dynamic execution patterns. The most suspicious report (Report 3) justifies higher malware and risk scores. Overall, scores should be adjusted upward for better accuracy, especially in Report 1, to reflect the suspicious features. The rest are consistent with their analyses.",
