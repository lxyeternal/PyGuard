  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a specific task within a larger Python application, such as data processing, utility function, or library functionality.",
  "sources": "Data is read from environment variables, user input, or external files; also possibly from network sources if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system commands, network communication, or sensitive data storage such as files or environment variables.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs/environment) to sinks (outputs/system calls), potentially passing through intermediate processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscation, or unusual code constructs identified. No signs of malicious backdoors or secretive behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code was examined for malicious patterns such as code injection, data exfiltration, insecure handling of secrets, or suspicious external calls. No evidence of such behaviors was found. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard, and no obfuscation or malicious constructs are present. The structure indicates typical data processing without hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit signs of malicious intent or malware. It appears to be standard application code with no security risks detected based on the provided snippet.",
