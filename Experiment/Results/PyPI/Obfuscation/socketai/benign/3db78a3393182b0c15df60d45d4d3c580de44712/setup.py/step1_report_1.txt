{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package related to image data analysis, including package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file from the package directory",
  "sinks": "No evident untrusted data sinks or data leaks; no external network or system commands executed",
  "flows": "Read from filesystem (README.md) -> Package metadata; dependencies loaded for installation",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, unconventional variable naming, and inconsistent indentation or code style. No explicit malicious code or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools and reads a README file using obfuscated variable names, which could be an attempt to conceal intent. The setup function specifies package metadata and dependencies, which are typical for a package distribution script. There are no network connections, code injections, or suspicious commands present. The obfuscated naming might be considered unusual but does not directly imply malicious behavior. No code execution or external data handling beyond standard package setup is observed.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup.py script with obfuscated variable names. No evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks is detected. The obfuscation appears to be an attempt to conceal the code's purpose but does not indicate harmful behavior.",
