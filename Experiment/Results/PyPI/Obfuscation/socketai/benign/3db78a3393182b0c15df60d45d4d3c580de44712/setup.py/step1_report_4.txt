  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package aimed at extracting features from image data for research purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'README.md' file for long description; imports from setuptools and os modules.",
  "sinks": "No clear untrusted data sinks; no data leakage or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "Reads README.md content into a variable; passes package metadata to setuptools.setup() function.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names and unusual string assignments; no obvious malicious code or backdoors. No dynamic code execution or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names, likely to conceal the variable purpose. It imports necessary modules, reads a README file, and defines package metadata. All dependencies are typical for a research-oriented image processing package. No code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious logic is present. The obfuscation appears to be an attempt at concealment but does not inherently indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard package setup file with obfuscated variable names. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. The obfuscation may be benign or an attempt to hide simple variable purpose, but overall, the code is benign.",
