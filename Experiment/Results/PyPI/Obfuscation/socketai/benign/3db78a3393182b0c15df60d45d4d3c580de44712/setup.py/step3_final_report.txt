  "purpose": "Standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project related to image data analysis, with obfuscated variable names.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md for long description; defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external network or system calls observed.",
  "flows": "Initialization and setup functions with no external data flow or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, which are unusual but not malicious; no malicious code or network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package, with obfuscated variable names possibly to conceal intent. No malicious behavior, network activity, or data leaks are present. Dependencies are standard for image analysis and research. The obfuscation appears superficial, not indicative of malicious intent. Malware score is zero, consistent with the absence of malicious code. Obfuscation score is moderate (~0.5), reflecting variable name obscurity but not malicious concealment. Security risk is low (~0.2), as the code performs standard setup tasks without vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated setup script for an image data analysis package. No evidence of malicious activity or supply chain sabotage is detected. The obfuscation is superficial and does not elevate security concerns. Scores are consistent with the analysis, with malware at 0, obfuscation around 0.5, and low security risk.",
