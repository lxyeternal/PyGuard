{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform data handling, possibly involving network communication or environment variable access, with no explicit malicious activity or obfuscation detected.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, data input functions, network communication points",
  "sinks": "Potential data exfiltration points via network, environment variable access",
  "flows": "Input sources (environment/network) to data processing or transmission functions",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. Data flows from environment or network inputs to processing or transmission points without suspicious patterns. No suspicious functions, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscation techniques are present. The overall structure is standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The low scores across malware and obfuscation are justified, and the moderate security risk score reflects cautious monitoring rather than active threat.",
