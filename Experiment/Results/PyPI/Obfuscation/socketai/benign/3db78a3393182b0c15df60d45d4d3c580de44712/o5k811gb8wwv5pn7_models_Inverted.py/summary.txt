  "conclusion": "The code is a typical machine learning model loader with external dependencies. No malicious activity or backdoors are detected. The obfuscation and external URL reliance pose supply chain risks but do not constitute malicious intent. The malware score is 0, the obfuscation score is approximately 0.2, and the security risk score is around 0.2-0.4, reflecting moderate supply chain concern without active malicious behavior."
