  "conclusion": "The code is a standard model loading and inference setup with obfuscated variable names. No malicious activity or malware is evident. The main security consideration is the external weight download without validation, which is a common but manageable risk. The obfuscation reduces readability but does not indicate malicious intent. The overall security risk is low."
