{
  "purpose": "Load a pre-trained age classification model, download weights if not present locally, and construct the model architecture.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, checks local filesystem for weights, downloads weights from a remote URL, loads weights into the model.",
  "sinks": "Loads weights into the neural network model, performs inference on input data.",
  "flows": "From remote URL to local filesystem, then into model weights loading, then inference.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with inconsistent variable names, syntax irregularities, malformed layer definitions, suspiciously complex code structure, inconsistent string quotations.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a CNN model similar to VGG, downloads weights from an external URL if not found locally, and loads them into the model. Obfuscation and syntax irregularities suggest possible concealment or poor coding practices. No explicit malicious actions such as data exfiltration, network communication beyond initial download, or system modification are evident. The external dependency poses supply chain risks. The obfuscation complicates static analysis but does not confirm malicious intent. The code appears primarily designed for model loading and inference, with no active malicious payloads detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily a model loader with obfuscation and external dependencies that introduce supply chain risks. There is no direct evidence of malicious behavior such as data theft, backdoors, or system compromise. The obfuscation and reliance on external, unverified sources warrant caution but do not confirm malware. The security risk is moderate due to these factors. Overall, the code appears benign but warrants further verification of external sources and deobfuscation for clarity.",
