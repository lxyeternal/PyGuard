{
  "purpose": "The code loads a pre-trained ResNet50V2 model, optionally downloads its weights if not already present, and constructs a custom classification model with additional layers.",
  "sources": "The code reads a URL for weights download, checks for existing local files, and reads environment variables or paths from functions.dQarIOwRAWifxvWvxLzRjvEwWvUiwSCN().",
  "sinks": "The code writes model weights to local storage, loads model weights, and possibly downloads data from an external URL.",
  "flows": "The URL for weights download flows from the network to the local file system; the weights file flows from the network to local storage; the model loads weights from local storage; model training or inference flows to external outputs (not shown).",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names (e.g., dPHEjfBVsGgIFXurSLGxbqJAdABlgRFY, dkNcjvdJmStkdDZJTDoaQTBjqGSqZZBp) and function calls (functions.dQarIOwRAWifxvWvxLzRjvEwWvUiwSCN), which are suggestive of obfuscation. Also, the code downloads weights from an external URL, which could be risky if URL is malicious. The URL appears to point to a GitHub release, but the obfuscated code raises suspicion.",
  "analysis": "The script obfuscates variable and function names, making the code harder to understand. It fetches weights from an external URL (GitHub link), and stores them locally, downloading only if not already present. The model architecture is standard, with no evidence of malicious layers or behaviors. The code does not perform any network communication beyond the initial download, nor does it execute any code from untrusted sources at runtime. However, the obfuscation and external download are potential indicators of malicious intent or sabotage, especially if the source is malicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious network behaviors are evident beyond the download. The download and file check logic are typical for model loading scripts, but combined with obfuscated names, they raise suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "The code constructs a standard deep learning model, but uses obfuscated naming and fetches weights from an external URL, which could be malicious or compromised. No explicit malicious activities are detected, but obfuscation and external download pose a moderate security concern.",
