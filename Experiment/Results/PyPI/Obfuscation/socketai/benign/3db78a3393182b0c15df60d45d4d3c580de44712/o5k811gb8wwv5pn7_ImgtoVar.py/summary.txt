  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, though heavily obfuscated, multimedia analysis pipeline. The main concerns are external dependency integrity and obfuscation, which could hide malicious payloads. Overall, there is no concrete evidence of malware, but the risk warrants caution. The malware score is approximately 0.2, obfuscation around 0.8, and overall security risk about 0.4."
