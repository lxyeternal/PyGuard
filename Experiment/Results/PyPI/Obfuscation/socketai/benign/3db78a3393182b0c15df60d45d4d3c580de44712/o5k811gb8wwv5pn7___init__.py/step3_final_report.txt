  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Standard data inputs such as variables, environment variables, external data sources.",
  "sinks": "Potential network connections, file operations, environment variables, or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks, possibly untrusted data leading to security issues.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate benign, straightforward code with no obfuscation or malicious activity. Malware scores are consistently zero, aligning with the absence of malicious indicators. Security risk scores are set at 0.2, reflecting a conservative low-risk estimate suitable for utility scripts. Confidence levels are high (0.8-0.9), justified by thorough reasoning. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are identified across the reports.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency appears safe with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores are consistent with the analyses, and the overall security posture is benign. Minor adjustment could be lowering the security risk score to 0.1 for a more conservative stance, but 0.2 remains acceptable.",
