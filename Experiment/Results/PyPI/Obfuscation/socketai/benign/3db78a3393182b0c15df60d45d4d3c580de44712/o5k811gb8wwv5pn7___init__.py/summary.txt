  "conclusion": "The dependency appears safe with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores are consistent with the analyses, and the overall security posture is benign. Minor adjustment could be lowering the security risk score to 0.1 for a more conservative stance, but 0.2 remains acceptable."
