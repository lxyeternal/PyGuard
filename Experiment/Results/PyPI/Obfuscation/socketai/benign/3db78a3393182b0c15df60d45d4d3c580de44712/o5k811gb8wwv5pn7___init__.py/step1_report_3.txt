  "purpose": "This code appears to be a standard Python script with typical functionality; no explicit purpose is evident without further context.",
  "sources": "Reads input from environment variables, function parameters, or external files (if any).",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe if user input or untrusted data is processed without validation; includes network connections, subprocess calls, or file operations.",
  "flows": "Data from sources (e.g., environment variables, inputs) flows into functions that perform actions such as file I/O, network communication, or system commands.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. No unusual or suspicious code constructs are present. The code structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script's structure and content suggest standard functionality with no signs of malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious external connections identified. The code performs typical operations such as reading data, processing, and output, with no indications of malicious behavior. Given the absence of suspicious patterns, the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems to serve its intended purpose without evident malicious intent.",
