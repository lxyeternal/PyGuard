{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a simple utility script, likely for data processing or communication, but the specific purpose is unclear due to the lack of comments or explicit function definitions.",
  "sources": "Data is read from the 'input_data' variable, environment variables, and possibly external files or network sources if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communication functions, file write operations, or system commands, which could be exploited if untrusted data is involved.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (such as environment variables or input variables) through processing functions to sinks like network calls or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity are detected. The code does not contain any malicious functions or payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code lacks comments, contains minimal complexity, and uses standard Python constructs. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or hidden backdoors. The overall structure suggests a benign utility script. However, without additional context or external dependencies, absolute certainty isn't possible, but nothing suspicious is detected in the visible code.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a straightforward utility with no malicious intent. The confidence level is high due to the lack of suspicious patterns.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
