{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'libknot' Python package, primarily used for packaging and distribution of the library.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file to include its content as the long description.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data is written or executed.",
  "flows": "Reads the README.md file, assigns its content to the package's description parameter during setup.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names (e.g., IHNZpPAUUrbouhKBjdososOLfAmFxYed, ojypbwDfZVIehXwJGhnkhcWCfDiQKVxn, PcCQrhlHskSHdMjwrGmCdQuyvXpBkOgG, YupNULQpjczNZMRSMxVowQIWOkCPtzqv) which do not match standard naming conventions. These could be an attempt to obscure the code's intent or to evade detection.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a standard package setup using setuptools, with variables assigned to string literals, including reading the 'README.md' file if it exists. The variable names are intentionally obscure, which is unusual for typical setup scripts and could be a sign of obfuscation. The code does not contain any network activity, data exfiltration, command execution, or other suspicious behaviors. No hardcoded credentials or malicious logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup script with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based on the provided code. The obfuscation could be benign or for internal purposes, but it does not raise security concerns in itself.",
