{
  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script that reads 'README.md' if available and configures package metadata using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file from local filesystem.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or external data handling.",
  "flows": "Reads local file -> passes content to setuptools.setup()",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated variable names; no malicious code or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with obfuscated variable names but performs a benign task of configuring package metadata. It reads a local README file and calls setuptools.setup() with static data. There are no network calls, dynamic code execution, or handling of untrusted inputs. The obfuscation appears cosmetic rather than malicious. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. The variable names, while obscure, do not indicate malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with this analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with superficial obfuscation. No malicious activity or security risks are evident. The malware score should be 0, and the obfuscation and risk scores are justified given the variable naming and code behavior.",
