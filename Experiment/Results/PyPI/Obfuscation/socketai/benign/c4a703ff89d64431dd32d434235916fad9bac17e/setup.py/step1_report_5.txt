{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'libknot' Python package, intended to configure package metadata and prepare for installation.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file if it exists to include as long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; standard setup functions used for package configuration.",
  "flows": "Reads 'README.md' file content, then passes it to setuptools.setup as a long description.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are obfuscated, but there is no malicious or suspicious logic; code appears straightforward and typical for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'pathlib' and 'setuptools', reads a 'README.md' file if it exists, and then calls 'setuptools.setup' with package metadata. Variable obfuscation is present but no malicious behavior is detected. No use of untrusted inputs, no data exfiltration, network activity, or obfuscation aimed at hiding malicious intent. The code performs a standard package setup configuration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for a Python package with obfuscated variable names but no malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears to serve only the purpose of package configuration and metadata setup.",
