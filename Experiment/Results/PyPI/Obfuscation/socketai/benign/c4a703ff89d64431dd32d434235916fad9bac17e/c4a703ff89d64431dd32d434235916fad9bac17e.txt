      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with superficial obfuscation. No malicious activity or security risks are evident. The malware score should be 0, and the obfuscation and risk scores are justified given the variable naming and code behavior."

      "obfuscated": 0.75,
      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "This dependency acts as a complex interface to native network control functions with significant obfuscation and native interactions. While no explicit malware or malicious payloads are evident, the native calls and obfuscation increase the risk profile. The code could be exploited if inputs are malicious or if the underlying native library is compromised. The overall security risk is moderate to high, warranting cautious handling and further validation."

      "obfuscated": 0.75,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code functions as an obfuscated interface to a native 'knot' library, with no direct evidence of malicious behavior. While obfuscation and dynamic DLL loading warrant caution, there is no indication of malware or sabotage in this fragment. The scores should reflect low malware likelihood but recognize the obfuscation as a potential risk factor."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "This is a legitimate, obfuscated wrapper around an external 'libknot' library for domain name processing, with no signs of malicious behavior. The obfuscation and external dependency warrant cautious trust, but the code itself does not exhibit malicious intent."

      "obfuscated": 0.6,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate network protocol and probing utility that interfaces with an external 'libknot' library. It does not contain explicit malicious payloads or backdoors. However, reliance on external native code without validation and obfuscated naming increase security risks. The malware score is low (0.2), and the overall security risk is moderate (0.4). Further validation of the external library's integrity and input sanitization is recommended."
