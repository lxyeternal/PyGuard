  "conclusion": "This dependency acts as a complex interface to native network control functions with significant obfuscation and native interactions. While no explicit malware or malicious payloads are evident, the native calls and obfuscation increase the risk profile. The code could be exploited if inputs are malicious or if the underlying native library is compromised. The overall security risk is moderate to high, warranting cautious handling and further validation."
