  "conclusion": "The code functions as an obfuscated interface to a native 'knot' library, with no direct evidence of malicious behavior. While obfuscation and dynamic DLL loading warrant caution, there is no indication of malware or sabotage in this fragment. The scores should reflect low malware likelihood but recognize the obfuscation as a potential risk factor."
