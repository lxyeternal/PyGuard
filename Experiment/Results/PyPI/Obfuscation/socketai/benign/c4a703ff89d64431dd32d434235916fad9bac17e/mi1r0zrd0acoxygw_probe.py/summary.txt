  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate network protocol and probing utility that interfaces with an external 'libknot' library. It does not contain explicit malicious payloads or backdoors. However, reliance on external native code without validation and obfuscated naming increase security risks. The malware score is low (0.2), and the overall security risk is moderate (0.4). Further validation of the external library's integrity and input sanitization is recommended."
