  "purpose": "Minimal Python module importing an obfuscated symbol from a local module and defining an export list.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .test_utils module, reading the symbol egaxczYmRIzhDpVdPjCIKpraGVkVWazq.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data flows; no external interactions or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Import source (local module) to the symbol egaxczYmRIzhDpVdPjCIKpraGVkVWazq; no further flows observed.",
  "anomalies": "The imported symbol name appears obfuscated or randomly generated, which is unusual and suspicious but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a single, obfuscated-looking symbol from a local module and defines an __all__ list. No dynamic code, data flows, or external interactions are present. The obfuscated name raises suspicion but lacks evidence of malicious activity. Scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated ~0.7, risk ~0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code but acknowledge the obfuscation. The absence of usage of the imported symbol suggests it may be a placeholder or part of a larger context. Overall, the code appears benign, with obfuscation as a potential concealment tactic, but no active malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with an obfuscated import name that warrants caution but does not indicate malicious intent. Scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. Further context could clarify the purpose of the obfuscated symbol, but based on this fragment alone, it poses minimal security risk.",
