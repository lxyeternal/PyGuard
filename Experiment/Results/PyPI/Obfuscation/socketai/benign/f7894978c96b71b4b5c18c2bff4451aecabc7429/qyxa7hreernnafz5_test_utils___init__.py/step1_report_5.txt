{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python module that imports a specific symbol from a local utility module and defines an export list.",
  "sources": "The code reads a symbol 'egaxczYmRIzhDpVdPjCIKpraGVkVWazq' from the 'test_utils' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The imported symbol could be used elsewhere, but within this fragment, no data flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "The imported symbol name 'egaxczYmRIzhDpVdPjCIKpraGVkVWazq' appears to be a random or obfuscated string, which could indicate obfuscation or hidden intent. The module exports only 'pprint_equal_to', but this symbol is not defined or used within this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a seemingly random or obfuscated symbol from a local module, possibly to hide or obfuscate functionality. The export list is minimal and standard. There are no apparent security issues or malicious behaviors, but the obfuscated import name warrants suspicion as it may be part of an attempt to conceal malicious code or behavior. Since this is only a fragment, further context is needed to fully assess intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself is simple and does not contain explicit malicious behavior. The obfuscated import name is unusual and could suggest an attempt at concealment. No malware or security risks are immediately apparent based solely on this snippet.",
