  "purpose": "Import a specific object from a local module named test_utils and define __all__ for export control.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'egaxczYmRIzhDpVdPjCIKpraGVkVWazq' from .test_utils module.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that could lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The imported object could be used elsewhere, but no data flow is shown here.",
  "anomalies": "The imported attribute name 'egaxczYmRIzhDpVdPjCIKpraGVkVWazq' appears to be a random string, which is unusual and suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a seemingly random or obfuscated attribute from a local module and defines __all__ with a static string. The attribute name is suspicious due to its randomness, which could suggest obfuscation or hidden intent. There are no other code constructs, no dynamic code execution, or external data handling. The import itself is from a relative module, which is standard, but the attribute name warrants caution as it could be part of an obfuscation or malicious scheme. No malicious code or behaviors are evident in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal and appears to be benign in structure. However, the imported attribute name's obfuscated appearance raises suspicion about possible hidden or malicious intent, especially if used elsewhere. No malicious activity or security risks are directly observable within this snippet.",
