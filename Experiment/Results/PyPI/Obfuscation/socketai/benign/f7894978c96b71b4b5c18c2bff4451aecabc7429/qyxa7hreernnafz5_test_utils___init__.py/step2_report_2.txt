  "review": "Let's analyze these reports systematically.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code imports a single symbol `egaxczYmRIzhDpVdPjCIKpraGVkVWazq` from a local module `.test_utils`.\n- It defines `__all__ = (\"pprint_equal_to\",)` to control exports.\n- The imported symbol is a long, seemingly random string, which appears obfuscated or auto-generated.\n- There are no data flows, external sinks, or malicious code present in this fragment.\n- The symbol is not used within this snippet, but may be used elsewhere.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  The reports correctly identify the import of an obfuscated symbol, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No malicious activity or data flow is evident.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- The reports are consistent; they acknowledge the obfuscated import name but correctly conclude benignity based on this fragment.\n- No significant errors or flawed reasoning are apparent.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports. This aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Ranges from 0.6 to 0.8, which seems reasonable given the obfuscated nature of the imported symbol.\n- **Security risk:** Low (0.1-0.2), consistent with no evident malicious activity.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- The obfuscated import name raises suspicion but, in isolation, does not constitute a security risk.\n- The lack of usage, dynamic code, or external data flows supports a low malware and risk score.\n\n### Potential issues:\n- The import name's obfuscation could be part of an attempt to hide malicious code, but there's no evidence here.\n- The fact that the imported symbol is not used within this fragment might suggest placeholder or obfuscation tactics.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis. The high obfuscation scores reflect suspicion but not confirmed malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0 (benign fragment)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0.7 (moderately obfuscated, but not necessarily malicious)  \n**Risk score:** 0.2 (low, given no evidence of malicious activity)\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusion:\nThe code appears benign, with obfuscation possibly indicating an attempt to conceal or generate code dynamically. Without further context, it's prudent to keep suspicion but not escalate risk.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.7  \n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThese reflect a cautious but justified stance based on the available fragment.",
