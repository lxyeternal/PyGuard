  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n### General observations:\n- The code is a module that imports many functions/classes with obfuscated or nonsensical variable names.\n- The only actual code is a version string assignment with an obscure variable name and a list of imports.\n- No runtime data processing, external inputs, network calls, or data leaks are visible.\n- The variable names and large import lists suggest obfuscation but not necessarily malicious intent.\n- The version string assignment appears straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n**Summary:**\n- Obfuscated variable names.\n- No malicious patterns.\n- Low malware and risk scores.\n- Confidence: 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The report correctly notes obfuscation but finds no malicious activity.\n- The malware score of 0.0 aligns with the analysis.\n- Risk score of 0.1 is reasonable, given obfuscation but no evidence of threat.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n**Summary:**\n- Similar to Report 1.\n- No signs of malicious activity.\n- Perfect confidence.\n- Malware: 0, Risk: 0.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The report correctly identifies this as a standard module setup.\n- Malware score of 0 matches the absence of malicious indicators.\n- Risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n**Summary:**\n- Obfuscated variable names.\n- No suspicious behavior.\n- Slightly higher obfuscation score (0.2).\n- Malware: 0, Risk: 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The report emphasizes the obfuscation but finds no malicious activity.\n- The risk score is low; the obfuscation alone isn't enough to raise it.\n- Malware score remains 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n**Summary:**\n- Similar to previous reports.\n- No malicious behavior.\n- Obfuscation score 0.0, malware 0, risk 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The report correctly notes the standard nature of the code.\n- Obfuscation is minimal here, and no malicious patterns are detected.\n- The risk score of 0.1 is acceptable.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n**Summary:**\n- Obfuscated variable name assigned to version string.\n- Lengthy, seemingly random import names.\n- Obfuscation score high (0.8).\n- Malware: 0, Risk: 0.2.\n- Notes potential concealment but no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The variable name and import names are suspicious but do not demonstrate malicious activity.\n- The higher obfuscation score is justified.\n- Malware remains 0, consistent with the lack of malicious indicators.\n- Risk score of 0.2 is acceptable, considering the obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusions:\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard module setup with obfuscated variable and function names.\n- No evidence of malware, network activity, or data exfiltration.\n- The obfuscation appears to be an attempt to conceal code structure but not necessarily malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0.0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** Based on the reports, I would assign an obfuscated score of **0.6**, reflecting moderate obfuscation but not full concealment.  \n**Risk score:** Given the obfuscation and lack of malicious activity, I would set the overall risk at **0.2**.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n| Score Type      | Final Estimated Score |\n|-----------------|-----------------------|\n| Malware         | 0.0                   |\n| Obfuscated      | 0.6                   |\n| Risk            | 0.2                   |\n\nThis conservative estimate recognizes the obfuscation but confirms the absence of malicious intent or active security threats.",
