{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a Python package, likely for data processing or transformation, involving categorical data, grouping, mapping, and utility functions.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.categorical, .group, .mapping, .util) and a version string assignment",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted",
  "flows": "Imported functions and variables are used within the module; no external data flow or user input handling observed",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code detected. The version string assignment is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple functions and variables from internal modules, defining an API via __all__. The import statements are static, and the version string is a simple assignment. The code structure suggests standard modular design without malicious code. No code injection, network communication, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code is clean, organized, and does not include any suspicious constructs or unusual code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a typical part of a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It primarily defines the package's public interface and imports internal functions. There are no indications of malware or security vulnerabilities.",
