{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Python module with static imports from internal submodules, assigns a version string to an obfuscated variable, and exposes specific functions/classes via __all__. It appears to be a standard package setup with obfuscated naming but no active malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "The version string assignment and the import statements from internal modules.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input, perform network communication, or write to files.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is static and does not execute runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable name 'GXFhtYgzGtrYgNCPqvqwhiPfuXAIZToZ' assigned a version string; lengthy, nonsensical import names; presence of obfuscated identifiers.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static import statements with obfuscated variable names and a version string assignment. No dynamic behavior, data flow, or external communication is present. The obfuscation appears to be either a form of code concealment or generated naming, not necessarily malicious. The __all__ list indicates a standard API exposure. No signs of malicious code, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection, are evident. The high confidence scores reflect the static and benign nature of the code, with the obfuscation being the primary concern but not indicative of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated module setup with no active security threats. The obfuscation is notable but does not imply malicious behavior. Scores are consistent with a safe, static code snippet, though ongoing monitoring of obfuscated code is advisable.",
