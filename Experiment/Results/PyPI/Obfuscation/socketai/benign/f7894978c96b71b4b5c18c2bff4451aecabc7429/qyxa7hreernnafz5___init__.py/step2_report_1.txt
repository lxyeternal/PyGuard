  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, compare their assessments with the code, and determine appropriate scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is mainly static imports with obfuscated variable names, no malicious patterns, and no data flow or external communication. It appears to be a standard module with obfuscated naming.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- **Presence of issues:** No. The code does not perform any malicious actions.  \n- **Obfuscation:** Present but not malicious.  \n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — consistent.  \n- **Security risk:** Low (0.1) — reasonable, given no malicious activity.  \n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — high, given the static nature.  \n\n**Verdict:**  \nThe report's conclusion aligns well with the code. The obfuscation is noted but not suspicious. The scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n**Summary:**  \nAgain, the code is a typical package module with static imports, no external data handling, and no suspicious behavior. It emphasizes standard modular design.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Security risk:** 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Confidence:** 1 — very high, given the straightforward nature.  \n\n**Verdict:**  \nThe report is accurate. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n**Summary:**  \nSimilar to previous reports, it highlights standard import statements, no external data flow, and no malicious patterns. Obfuscated variable names are present but not suspicious.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- **Malicious activity:** None.  \n- **Obfuscation:** Present but not malicious.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent.  \n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — reasonable.  \n\n**Verdict:**  \nThe analysis and scoring are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n**Summary:**  \nAgain, the code is a module setup with no signs of malicious behavior. Obfuscated variable names are noted but not suspicious.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — reasonable.  \n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — high.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nThe report's conclusions and scores are consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n**Summary:**  \nThis report notes the obfuscated variable assignment (`GXFhtYgzGtrYgNCPqvqwhiPfuXAIZToZ`) with a version string, and lengthy, seemingly random import names. It suggests possible obfuscation or concealment but finds no malicious activity.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The variable name and string are unusual but not inherently malicious.  \n- No external data flow, network activity, or system modifications are observed.  \n- The obfuscation could be for concealment but does not imply malicious intent.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 — consistent.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.8 — justified given the obfuscated variable name and string.  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 — reasonable, considering potential concealment but no active threat.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nThe analysis is cautious and appropriate. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not indicate malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary & Final Estimation**\n\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  All reports agree on 0.0, and I concur. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  Given the obfuscated variable name and string, I estimate a **0.7** score overall, balancing the reports' concern and the lack of evidence for malicious intent.\n\n- **Risk Score:**  \n  Since there's no active malicious activity, but obfuscation is present, a **0.2** seems appropriate. I might slightly raise it to **0.3** considering the potential for concealment, but cautious evaluation supports 0.2.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0.0** (No malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated:** **0.7** (Obfuscation present but not necessarily malicious)  \n- **Risk:** **0.3** (Low, but with some concern due to obfuscation)  \n\nThe code appears to be a standard, obfuscated module setup with no active security threats. However, the obfuscation warrants cautious monitoring in future analyses.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign but obfuscated. The scores reflect a low security risk with a moderate obfuscation concern. No evidence supports malicious activity or vulnerabilities.",
