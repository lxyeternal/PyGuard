  "purpose": "Load a JSON template, replace placeholders in 'name' fields with provided variable values, and return the modified JSON.",
  "sources": "Reading JSON data from a file, accessing 'fields' array, reading 'name' attributes, and input variable values.",
  "sinks": "String formatting in 'name' attributes, which could lead to injection if inputs are maliciously crafted.",
  "flows": "JSON loaded -> iterate over 'fields' -> identify 'name' containing placeholder -> format 'name' with variable values -> return modified JSON.",
  "anomalies": "Use of string formatting without validation, potential injection risk; open() without context manager; no obfuscation or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward JSON template loading and string replacement. No malicious actions or obfuscation are present. The main concern is potential injection if input data is malicious, but this is typical in template processing. Malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero. The security risk score of 0.2 reflects low risk due to possible injection, which is justified given the lack of input validation. Confidence in benign assessment is high (0.9).",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily a template expansion utility. The only notable risk is injection if inputs are malicious, but no malicious intent or behavior is evident. Scores are consistent with the code's behavior. No changes recommended.",
