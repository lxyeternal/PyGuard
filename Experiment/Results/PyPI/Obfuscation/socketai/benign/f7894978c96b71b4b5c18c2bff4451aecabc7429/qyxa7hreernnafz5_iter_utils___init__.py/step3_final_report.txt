  "purpose": "This code module re-exports utility functions related to handling optional or singleton values, imported from a local obfuscated module.",
  "sources": "Import statements from .iter_utils with obfuscated identifiers",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external communication present in this snippet",
  "flows": "Import of functions from iter_utils (obfuscated) to module namespace, then exported via __all__",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated import identifiers that do not convey meaning, potential concealment of malicious code",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple symbols with nonsensical names from a local module, then defines __all__ with meaningful utility function names. No function implementations or data flows are visible. The obfuscated identifiers are suspicious but not inherently malicious. The code appears benign, serving as an interface re-export. The high obfuscation score (around 0.8) reflects suspicion, but malware score remains at 0 due to lack of evidence. Risk score is low (~0.2), considering the obfuscation alone. Further investigation into the contents of 'iter_utils' is recommended to confirm whether the functions are benign or malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet is a benign utility interface with obfuscated import names. While obfuscation warrants caution, there is no direct evidence of malicious activity or security risks. The high obfuscation score is justified, but overall risk remains low. Further analysis of the 'iter_utils' module is advised before making definitive security assessments.",
