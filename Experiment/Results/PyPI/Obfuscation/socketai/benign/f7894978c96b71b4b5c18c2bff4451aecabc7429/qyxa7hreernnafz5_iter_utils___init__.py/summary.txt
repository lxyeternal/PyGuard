  "conclusion": "The snippet is a benign utility interface with obfuscated import names. While obfuscation warrants caution, there is no direct evidence of malicious activity or security risks. The high obfuscation score is justified, but overall risk remains low. Further analysis of the 'iter_utils' module is advised before making definitive security assessments."
