  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions with obfuscated names, performing benign in-memory data manipulations. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security threats. The high obfuscation score is justified, but the malware score remains zero. The overall security risk is low, and the code appears safe for use."
