  "purpose": "Utility functions for data comparison, formatting, and assertion with detailed discrepancy reporting.",
  "sources": "Input data structures provided to comparison functions; data passed as 'expected' and 'actual' parameters.",
  "sinks": "Raises exceptions on mismatches; no external data transmission or system modification observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through sorting and comparison, leading to exception raising if discrepancies are found.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names; no malicious code or external side effects detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for formatting data structures and asserting their equality with detailed diff reporting. It uses standard libraries (pprint, deepdiff, BeamAssertException). No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious patterns are present. Obfuscation is notable but appears to serve concealment rather than malicious intent. The functions perform data comparison and detailed exception raising, typical in testing utilities. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0, low risk, high obfuscation) are consistent with the code's purpose and structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated testing utility for data comparison and reporting. No evidence of malware, malicious sabotage, or supply chain risks. The high obfuscation is likely for concealment but does not imply malicious intent. Overall security risk is low.",
