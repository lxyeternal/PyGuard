  "purpose": "Define several data transformation functions using Apache Beam for processing data streams or collections.",
  "sources": "Data inputs are not explicitly defined; functions are designed to be used as transforms on PCollections within Apache Beam pipelines.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks or outputs are present within this code; functions produce Beam transformations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (not shown) through these transformation functions to eventual outputs in the pipeline.",
  "anomalies": "Use of string labels like 'Label', 'Select', etc., as placeholders for transform names. Functions like GnGaVDQpGfVKSgEdxvTDSdbXBwlFSECy are used for JSON serialization, which is standard. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns are apparent. No obfuscation or malicious logic evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple functions that create Apache Beam Map transforms with lambda functions. These functions perform common data transformations: adding labels, selecting specific keys, projecting values into tuples, indexing by keys, converting Decimal objects for JSON serialization, stringifying objects, indexing by a single key, renaming keys based on a mapping, and excluding keys from records. All functions use straightforward lambda expressions and standard Python operations. No external network operations, system calls, or suspicious data handling are present. No malicious behaviors or backdoors are detected. The code appears to be boilerplate data processing functions intended for use in a larger pipeline. The use of descriptive but placeholder-like names suggests this is auto-generated or obfuscated code, but nothing malicious is implied.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of standard data transformation functions for Apache Beam pipelines. It does not exhibit malicious intent or suspicious behavior. No security risks are apparent from this isolated module.",
