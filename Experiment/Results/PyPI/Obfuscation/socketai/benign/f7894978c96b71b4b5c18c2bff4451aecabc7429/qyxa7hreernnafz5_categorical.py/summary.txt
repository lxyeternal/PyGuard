  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated data transformation pipeline performing typical feature engineering tasks. There is no evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not imply malicious intent. The malware score remains at 0, with high obfuscation (~0.7) and low risk (~0.2)."
