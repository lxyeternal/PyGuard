{
  "purpose": "This code imports obfuscated internal modules, defines a version string, and specifies exportable symbols, likely as part of a larger package.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules with obfuscated names; version string assignment.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, network calls, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Imports and variable assignments; no data flow from external inputs to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated import names and internal symbols; unusual naming but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward imports with obfuscated identifiers, which could be for internal API hiding or obfuscation. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or external data handling is evident. The version string and export list are benign. The high obfuscation scores across reports reflect suspicion but are justified given the naming. No malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities are detected within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module with internal obfuscated identifiers, likely for API concealment or anti-reverse engineering. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security risks based solely on this fragment. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not constitute malicious intent.",
