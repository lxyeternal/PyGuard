  "purpose": "Manage asynchronous PostgreSQL notifications, handle listeners, and queue incoming messages for processing.",
  "sources": "Listening to PostgreSQL notification channels via add_listener, receiving notifications through callback functions, and queuing notification objects.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data is directly written to external systems or files. The code uses parameterized queries, reducing injection risk.",
  "flows": "Notification channel name (input) triggers callback, which creates a notification object and puts it into an internal queue for processing.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of class and method names; no input validation on notification data; no explicit validation or sanitization of notification channel names or payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of an async PostgreSQL notification handler, with obfuscated identifiers that could be suspicious but are not inherently malicious. It uses parameterized queries for notifications, reducing injection risks. No hardcoded secrets or network exfiltration behaviors are present. The main concern is obfuscation and lack of validation, which could be exploited if malicious data is received downstream. Overall, the logic appears benign, with no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a typical async notification listener with obfuscated identifiers. No malicious activity is evident, but obfuscation and lack of input validation warrant cautious review. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with this assessment.",
