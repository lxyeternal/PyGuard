{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract class with multiple async method stubs, likely intended as an interface or base class for further implementation.",
  "sources": "No actual data input sources; only method signatures with no implementation or data handling.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed; methods are not implemented.",
  "flows": "No executable flow or data flow present due to lack of implementation; only method definitions with raise NotImplementedError.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated class and method names, which could be intentionally confusing, but this alone is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code only defines a class with unimplemented methods that raise NotImplementedError, serving as an interface or abstract base class. No data processing, external input, or network operations are present. The unusual naming could be an attempt at obfuscation, but it does not inherently indicate malicious behavior. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious activity within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This appears to be a purely structural, abstract class definition with no executable or malicious code. No security risks or malware indications are detected based on this code snippet.",
