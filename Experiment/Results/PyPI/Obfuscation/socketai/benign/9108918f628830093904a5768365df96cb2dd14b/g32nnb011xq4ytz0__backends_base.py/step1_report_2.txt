{
  "purpose": "The code defines an abstract class with several asynchronous methods that raise NotImplementedError, indicating it is likely intended as an interface or base class for further implementation.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; the code does not perform any data reading or processing.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points; the code does not contain any data handling, network connections, or external effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; all methods are placeholders raising exceptions, with no internal logic or data movement.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; the class consists solely of method declarations raising NotImplementedError, with no concrete logic or data manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains an abstract class definition with method signatures, all of which raise NotImplementedError. There are no implementations, data processing, or external interactions. The lack of logic, data handling, or external calls indicates this is a structural or interface component. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks present in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard abstract base class serving as an interface for further implementation. There are no malicious behaviors, security issues, or suspicious activity detected in this fragment.",
