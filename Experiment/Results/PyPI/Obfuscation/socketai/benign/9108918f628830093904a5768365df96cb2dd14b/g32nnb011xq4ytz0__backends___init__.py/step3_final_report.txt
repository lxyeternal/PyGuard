  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, input functions, network communication, dynamic code execution, hardcoded credentials.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file operations, environment variable access, eval/exec calls.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or user input flow into network functions, dynamic execution, or data processing routines.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious patterns include hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, network communication with external servers, potential obfuscation, and use of eval/exec.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits patterns that could be misused for malicious purposes, such as network communication and dynamic code execution, but no definitive malicious activity is confirmed. The presence of suspicious patterns justifies a moderate security risk score. No obfuscation or malware is detected. Input sources are standard, and sinks involve network and file operations. The flow from sources to sinks is typical but warrants caution due to patterns like hardcoded secrets.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows potential for misuse but lacks concrete evidence of malicious intent. Scores are consistent with the observed patterns, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a moderate security risk score of 0.4 justified by suspicious patterns. Confidence is high (0.8), given the patterns observed.",
