  "purpose": "Terminal image rendering utility supporting style and color modes, designed for styled text/image output in terminal environments.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (COLORTERM, TERM), input image data, style parameters, environment detection functions.",
  "sinks": "Generated styled string output for terminal display; no external network, file, or system modification observed.",
  "flows": "Input image and style parameters (source) processed through nested functions and pixel data loops (flow) to produce styled string output (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Heavy variable name obfuscation, complex nested logic, environment variable checks for terminal capabilities, but no malicious code or external communication.",
  "analysis": "The code is a heavily obfuscated terminal image rendering class, with functions for style parsing, environment detection, and pixel data processing. No network activity, file writes, or system commands are present. Obfuscation appears to serve proprietary or stylistic purposes rather than malicious intent. The logic focuses on pixel and style manipulation, outputting styled strings for terminal display. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful system modifications are evident. The obfuscation increases difficulty in maintenance but does not imply malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, albeit heavily obfuscated, terminal image rendering utility. There is no evidence of malware, malicious backdoors, or malicious data flow. The high obfuscation score is justified, but overall security risk remains low.",
