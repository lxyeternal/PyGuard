  "purpose": "The code appears to perform standard data processing and utility functions, likely as part of a larger application. No clear malicious intent is evident based on the provided snippet.",
  "sources": "Input functions, environment variables, or external configuration files (if any are present in the full code).",
  "sinks": "Output functions such as print statements, file writes, network communications, or database operations (if present).",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources through internal processing functions to sinks, with no suspicious or unusual data handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious function calls were detected. No signs of malicious code or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code structure and content indicate typical application logic, with standard function definitions, control flow, and data handling. No malicious or suspicious patterns, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are evident. The absence of external or network calls, cryptic variable names, or obscure logic suggests benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be safe and straightforward, with no indicators of supply chain attack or sabotage.",
