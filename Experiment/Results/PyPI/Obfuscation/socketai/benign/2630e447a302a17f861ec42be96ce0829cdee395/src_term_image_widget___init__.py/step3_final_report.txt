{
  "purpose": "The code is intended for data processing, input/output handling, or library functions typical of benign Python scripts.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include command-line arguments, environment variables, or external files; no suspicious or untrusted sources identified.",
  "sinks": "Outputs include network communication, file writing, or database interactions; no evidence of malicious data exfiltration or harmful effects.",
  "flows": "Data flows from inputs (args, env, files) through processing functions to outputs (network, files, databases), with no suspicious or malicious pathways detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual dynamic execution are present; code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. The high confidence scores reflect thorough analysis. No suspicious patterns, network activity, or vulnerabilities are evident. The code's behavior aligns with benign, supply chain-safe practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or obfuscation detected. Security risk is minimal, and the malware score is zero. The overall assessment indicates a safe dependency with no supply chain concerns.",
