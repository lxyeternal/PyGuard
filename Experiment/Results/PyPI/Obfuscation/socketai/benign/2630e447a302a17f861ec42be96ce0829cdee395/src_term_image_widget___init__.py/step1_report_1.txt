  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script, potentially for data processing or utility functions, with no explicit purpose stated within the snippet provided.",
  "sources": "Data sources include environment variables, user input, or external files (if any are used).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writing, or system commands, but none are explicitly evident in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (environment, input) to sinks (output, network, files) if present; however, no such flows are clearly demonstrated in this code segment.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual dynamic execution. No backdoors or suspicious behaviors are visible. The structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "A detailed review shows that the code performs typical operations without any signs of malicious activity. It does not manipulate or leak sensitive data, does not execute untrusted code, and uses standard libraries. There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated parts, or suspicious network activity. The code's purpose seems benign based on the visible content.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign, standard Python script with no indications of malware or security vulnerabilities.",
