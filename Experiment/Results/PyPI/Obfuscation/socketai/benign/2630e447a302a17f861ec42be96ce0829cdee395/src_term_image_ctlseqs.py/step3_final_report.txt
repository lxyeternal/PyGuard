  "purpose": "The code contains only comments, references, and URLs related to terminal control sequences and color names, serving as documentation or inline comments.",
  "sources": "Comments and references within the code, including URLs and control sequence descriptions.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or untrusted data flows; the code does not process input or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists, as the code is purely informational.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the content is static documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code is non-executable, consisting solely of comments and references. No dynamic behavior, data processing, or system modifications are present. The absence of code, combined with static references, indicates no malicious intent or security issues. All signals point to benign documentation with no obfuscation or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely informational documentation referencing terminal control sequences and color names. There are no security risks, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation present. The scores are appropriately set to zero, reflecting a benign and safe snippet.",
