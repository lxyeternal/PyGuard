  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as purely informational, consisting of comments, documentation links, and references to terminal control sequences and color names.\n- No executable code, data processing, input/output operations, or dynamic behavior are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the description.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), reflecting certainty that these are benign documentation snippets.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of Issues:** The reports correctly identify that the code is non-executable documentation or comments, with no malicious or security-sensitive content.\n- **Errors or Flaws:** No logical errors or flaws are evident in the reasoning; the assessments are consistent with the code content.\n- **Scores:** The malware scores are appropriately 0 across all reports. The security risk scores are also 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Risk Scores:** Given the lack of any active or dynamic code, the risk scores should remain low, typically below 0.5.\n\n---\n\n### Specific Points:\n- **Potential for Obfuscation or Malicious Behavior:** Since all content is static references and comments, the obfuscated scores are correctly 0.\n- **Malware Score Justification:** No malicious activity is claimed or implied; the malware score remains 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Claims Based on Assumptions:** The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the content as documentation.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Scores Adjustment:** No adjustments needed; all scores are reasonable.\n- **Additional Considerations:** While the current assessment is that these snippets are benign, if future code snippets include dynamic code, data handling, or system modifications, re-evaluation would be necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the code is non-malicious, purely documentation. No security risks are present based on the provided snippets.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the benign, informational nature of the code snippets. No changes to scores or assessments are necessary.",
