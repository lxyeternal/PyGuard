  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is purely informational, consisting of comments, references, or documentation links related to terminal control sequences and color names.\n- No executable code, data processing, or system modifications are present.\n- No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are identified.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), and malware/security risk scores are consistently 0.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Documentation or comments, no executable code.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies that there are no data flows, sinks, or sources that could lead to security issues.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, security risk = 0, which aligns with the content.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, references to control sequences and documentation.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes the absence of executable code or dynamic components.\n- **Scores:** Malware and risk scores are 0, consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Documentation/comments about terminal sequences.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly states that there's no malicious activity or executable code.\n- **Scores:** Zero malware/security risk.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Information about control sequences and color names.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies that it's purely informational.\n- **Scores:** Zero malware/security risk.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** References to control sequences and documentation URLs.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly states no executable logic or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Zero malware/security risk.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- All reports are consistent in their assessment.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate given the content.\n- The confidence levels are high, which is justified.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**The provided reports are accurate and reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n### Additional notes:\n- If I were to assign my own estimates, they would match the reports: **malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0**.\n- No further action needed; the content is benign documentation references.\n\n**Summary conclusion:**  \nThe reports are thorough, accurate, and consistent. The code snippets are purely informational, posing no security threat.",
