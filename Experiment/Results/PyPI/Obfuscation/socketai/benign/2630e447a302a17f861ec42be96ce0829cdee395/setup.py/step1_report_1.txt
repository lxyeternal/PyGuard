{
  "purpose": "The code is for setting up a Python package distribution, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading from 'README.md' file, hardcoded strings, and setup() function parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network connections, file writes, or execution functions are present.",
  "flows": "The code reads the README file, then uses static values and dependencies in setup(), with no dynamic or external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are obfuscated (e.g., YapCiTcpmcJzPqEdwhnCxBxxuzlAKAOo), but this alone is not suspicious. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code detected. The 'license' field contains a hardcoded license type, but this is standard. No obfuscated code, obfuscated strings, or suspicious function calls are present.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily imports setuptools, reads a markdown file for description, and calls setup() with package metadata and dependencies. The obfuscated variable names appear to be a form of code obfuscation, but no malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The dependencies listed are standard packages. No external data is fetched or sent, no dynamic code execution, and no malicious patterns observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with obfuscated variable names but no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain malware, suspicious data flows, or malicious code injection.",
