  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration for a Python project, including metadata, dependencies, and project URLs.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file, hardcoded package metadata, and dependencies in setup() call.",
  "sinks": "None identified—no untrusted data output, no network communication, no sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "Input from README.md -> used in setup() metadata; static package info -> used in package distribution.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are obfuscated or nonsensical, but this alone is not suspicious; no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, no malicious code activities detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of a setup.py configuration script with obfuscated variable names and static data. It reads a README.md file to include as long_description. No user input, network activity, or execution of dynamic code is present. The package dependencies are standard. The variable names appear intentionally obfuscated but do not execute or hide malicious payloads. No suspicious behaviors or malware indicators are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script functions as a typical setup configuration with obfuscated variable names. No malicious activity, security risks, or malware indications are detected. The obfuscation appears superficial and does not impact the security assessment.",
