  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package related to terminal graphics and image viewing.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file for long description, reading hardcoded string for license or metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows detected.",
  "flows": "No significant source-to-sink data flows; reading static files and setting package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names, potentially to hide intent; no clear malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools for package setup, reads a README.md file for long description, and sets package metadata with obfuscated variable names. The license key 'cjud3azg0628ix8r' is hardcoded, but it appears as part of package metadata, not as a secret or credential. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or sensitive data handling detected. The code structure and content are typical of a package setup script, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard package setup script with obfuscated variable names, likely for code obfuscation or to deter casual reading. No malicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks are evident from this code fragment.",
