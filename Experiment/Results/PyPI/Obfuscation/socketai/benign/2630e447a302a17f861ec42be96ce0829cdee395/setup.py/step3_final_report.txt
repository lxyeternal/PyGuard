  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python project, defining metadata, dependencies, and URLs.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for description; hardcoded string 'cjud3azg0628ix8r' as a parameter value.",
  "sinks": "None; no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "Static data from file read and hardcoded string passed into setup() parameters; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; presence of a hardcoded string that could be a license key or token.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py with superficial obfuscation and no malicious code. The only noteworthy element is the hardcoded string, which may be a license or identifier but does not exhibit malicious behavior. No dynamic or network activity is present. Obfuscation is minimal and likely for code concealment rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The package is benign, with no evidence of malware or malicious activity. The obfuscation is superficial, and the hardcoded string warrants caution if sensitive, but in this context, it appears as metadata. Overall security risk is very low.",
