{
  "purpose": "This code defines several custom exception and warning classes with obfuscated class names and attributes, likely intended for warning or error handling with non-descriptive identifiers.",
  "sources": "The code does not read any external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks related to data leaks, network operations, or sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks are present since no input or output operations are involved.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class names and attribute names, with attributes containing random-looking strings. The use of the __all__ variable to dynamically include classes based on type checks adds complexity but no clear malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of class definitions with obfuscated names and attributes, none of which perform any actions, input/output, or network operations. The __all__ list dynamically includes classes based on isinstance checks, which may be an attempt at hiding or complicating code comprehension but does not inherently indicate malicious behavior. No code injections, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The obfuscation might be suspicious but could also be a form of intentional code concealment. Overall, the code appears benign and does not demonstrate malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be obfuscated class definitions with no active behavior or malicious intent. There are no signs of malware, data exfiltration, or malicious logic. The obfuscation might be suspicious but does not constitute malicious activity based on this snippet alone.",
