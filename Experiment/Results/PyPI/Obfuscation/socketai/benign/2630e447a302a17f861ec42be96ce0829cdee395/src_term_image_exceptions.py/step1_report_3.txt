{
  "purpose": "Define custom warning and exception classes with obfuscated class names and attributes, with no apparent functional purpose beyond exception handling.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and their class variables (strings). No input sources or data reading mechanisms are present.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks or data output points; no functions, data flows, or external interactions are included.",
  "flows": "No data or control flow from sources to sinks, as the code only defines classes and variables without execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated class names and attributes, presence of seemingly random string constants, and dynamic generation of __all__ list based on class types. No functional code, but the obfuscation pattern is unusual and may be intended to hide malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple class definitions inheriting from standard exceptions and warnings, with class variables assigned to seemingly random strings. The class names and variable names are obfuscated, and the __all__ list dynamically includes classes that are subclasses of a specific class. There is no executable logic, data handling, or external interaction observed. The obfuscation may suggest an attempt to hide malicious activity or make reverse engineering difficult, but there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or network activity. The code's primary suspicious feature is its obfuscation pattern and dynamic __all__ assignment, which could be used to hide malicious payloads in a real scenario.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be obfuscated class definitions with no direct malicious actions or data flows. Its primary concern is the obfuscation pattern, which could be used to conceal malicious intent, but there is no concrete evidence of malware or malicious behavior within this fragment alone.",
