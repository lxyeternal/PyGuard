{
  "purpose": "Defines obfuscated warning and exception classes with static string attributes, and dynamically constructs __all__ based on subclasses, with no active code or external interactions.",
  "sources": "Class attribute assignments, subclass definitions, dynamic __all__ construction filtering subclasses of a specific class.",
  "sinks": "No data flows or external data handling; static class attributes pose no risk.",
  "flows": "Class definitions and attribute assignments; no runtime data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with cryptic class names and attributes; reference to an undefined symbol 'TermImageWarning' in __all__ (string present but class not defined).",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple obfuscated classes inheriting from standard exceptions or warnings, with static string attributes. The __all__ list is dynamically built by including subclasses of a specific class, which are all obfuscated. No functions, data handling, or external interactions are present. The obfuscation suggests an intent to conceal, but no malicious activity such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code injection is evident. The undefined symbol 'TermImageWarning' in __all__ indicates incomplete or placeholder code but does not imply malicious intent. The static attributes are harmless. Overall, the code appears benign but intentionally obfuscated, possibly to hinder analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated with no evidence of malicious behavior or active security threats. The obfuscation warrants caution, but based solely on this fragment, it appears benign. The high obfuscation score is justified; malware score remains at zero; security risk is low. Continuous monitoring and review in the context of the larger codebase are recommended.",
