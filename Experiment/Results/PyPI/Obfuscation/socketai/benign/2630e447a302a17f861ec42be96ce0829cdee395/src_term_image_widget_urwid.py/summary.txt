  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated terminal image rendering utility with no concrete evidence of malicious activity. The high obfuscation score is justified, and malware likelihood is minimal. The main concern is the obfuscation hindering thorough review, but functionally, it appears benign."
