{
  "purpose": "This code appears to provide utility functions and configurations for terminal or console interface management, including enabling/disabling queries, adjusting window sizes, and setting cell ratios and timeouts.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration values and system states from utils module (e.g., _query_timeout, _queries_enabled, _swap_win_size, _cell_size_lock, _cell_size_cache, get_cell_size, get_fg_bg_colors, get_terminal_name_version). It also reads input parameters in functions (ratio, timeout).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that process untrusted data into system effects or leaks. No network, file, or environment variable access that indicates data exfiltration or malicious output.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (ratio, timeout) flow into functions, which validate and set global state variables (JgAJfxgZFWaYmhzTnZXuQEyFMRuPKrvo, _query_timeout). Internal state changes occur, but no external harmful effects or data leaks are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains intentionally obfuscated variable names and function names, which may suggest attempts to hide intent. The import of a private utility module and the presence of functions that enable/disable queries or window size swapping are typical for UI or terminal configuration management, not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present. No suspicious network activity or system modifications are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines configuration constants, functions to enable or disable terminal queries and window size swapping, functions to get and set cell ratios and timeouts, and manages internal states via global variables. The obfuscated variable and function names do not seem to serve malicious purposes but could be designed to evade casual inspection. The code relies on the utils module for core configuration management. No data is sent externally, and no system files are modified. The use of locks suggests thread safety. Overall, the code appears to be legitimate utility functions for terminal UI management, with no evidence of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily utility functions for terminal interface management with obfuscated naming. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware, nor does it perform harmful system actions. The obfuscation is likely for code hiding or just stylistic, not malicious intent. Based on available information, there is no indication of supply chain security risks or malware.",
