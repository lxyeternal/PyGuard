  "purpose": "Configuration management for terminal and UI settings, including toggling query and window size behaviors, and managing cell ratios and timeouts.",
  "sources": "Internal utils module variables, environment-like variables, and internal cache/state variables.",
  "sinks": "Internal flags and cache variables, cache invalidation functions, and global configuration states.",
  "flows": "Functions modify internal flags and cache states based on internal conditions; no external data or network operations are present.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of variable and class names, use of a nonsensical exception class name, and manipulation of internal cache variables.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a set of configuration utility functions with obfuscated identifiers, managing internal state flags related to terminal or UI behaviors. No network, file, or external data operations are observed. The obfuscation could be an attempt to conceal malicious intent or simply a stylistic choice. The functions perform internal state toggling, cache invalidation, and timeout adjustments, which are typical for configuration modules. No malicious code, data exfiltration, or system modifications are evident from static analysis. The heavy obfuscation raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign configuration utility with significant obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity, data theft, or system sabotage. However, the obfuscation warrants cautious review before deployment, especially in supply chain contexts. The malware score is set to 0.1 reflecting minor suspicion primarily due to obfuscation, and the overall security risk remains low.",
