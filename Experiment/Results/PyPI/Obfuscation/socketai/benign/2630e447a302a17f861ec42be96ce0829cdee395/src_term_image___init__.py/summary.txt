  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign configuration utility with significant obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity, data theft, or system sabotage. However, the obfuscation warrants cautious review before deployment, especially in supply chain contexts. The malware score is set to 0.1 reflecting minor suspicion primarily due to obfuscation, and the overall security risk remains low."
