{
  "purpose": "Import a specific function from a local module and a command from an external library, likely for automation or browser control.",
  "sources": "Local module '.patch_pyppeteer' for 'fYBCqavwQCSVsSqwGPHwpXyfbDzImWUE' and external 'pyppeteer.command' for 'install'.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present in this snippet; no data output, network calls, or execution of untrusted input identified.",
  "flows": "No evident source-to-sink data flow; code merely performs imports without further actions.",
  "anomalies": "The imported function name 'fYBCqavwQCSVsSqwGPHwpXyfbDzImWUE' appears obfuscated or auto-generated, which could be suspicious, but it is not inherently malicious. The code does not show any malicious activity itself.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements. The first import pulls a potentially obfuscated or auto-generated function from a local module, which might be designed to hide its purpose. The second import is from a well-known library, 'pyppeteer'. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or execution of untrusted data. Without additional context, the code appears benign, but the obfuscated function name warrants further inspection of the local module.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet alone does not demonstrate malicious activity. The use of an obfuscated function name in a local module could be benign or an attempt to conceal functionality. No direct security threats or malware indicators are evident in these import statements.",
