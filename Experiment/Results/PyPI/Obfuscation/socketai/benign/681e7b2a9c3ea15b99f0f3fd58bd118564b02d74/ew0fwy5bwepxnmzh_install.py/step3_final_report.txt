{
  "purpose": "The code imports an obfuscated function from a local module and a command from pyppeteer, likely for further use in the project.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .patch_pyppeteer for fYBCqavwQCSVsSqwGPHwpXyfbDzImWUE; import from pyppeteer.command for install",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present in this snippet; no data leaks or malicious effects observable",
  "flows": "Import from local module to potential usage point; import from pyppeteer.command to install or execute commands",
  "anomalies": "Use of a highly obfuscated function name, relative import from a local module, which may suggest obfuscation or concealment",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, with no executable logic. The obfuscated function name and relative import are suspicious but not inherently malicious. The scores assigned in reports reflect suspicion primarily due to naming, not active malicious behavior. No evidence of network activity, data exfiltration, or code execution is present. The suspicion is based on obfuscation, which can be legitimate or malicious, but without further context, cannot be confirmed. The malware score remains low (0.1-0.2), and the obfuscation score is high (~0.75), consistent with suspicion. The overall security risk is low (~0.2-0.3). Further investigation into the local module and function implementation is recommended before making definitive security judgments.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign in structure but contains suspicious obfuscation in the function name. The scores assigned are appropriate given the limited context, emphasizing suspicion due to naming but with no active malicious indicators. Further source verification is advised before proceeding.",
