  "purpose": "Importing a function from a local module named 'patch_pyppeteer' and importing 'install' from 'pyppeteer.command'.",
  "sources": "The local module '.patch_pyppeteer' and the 'pyppeteer.command' package.",
  "sinks": "None directly evident; no untrusted data output or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks identified; the code only performs imports.",
  "anomalies": "The imported function 'fYBCqavwQCSVsSqwGPHwpXyfbDzImWUE' has a non-descriptive, seemingly random name, which could indicate obfuscation or malicious intent. The use of relative import '.' may suggest tampering or unusual project structure. No other anomalies are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function with a non-descriptive name from a local module, which could be an obfuscated function possibly used for malicious purposes. It also imports a standard 'install' function from the 'pyppeteer.command' module, which is common for controlling or automating browser tasks. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or execution of suspicious code. The suspicious element is primarily the cryptic function name and relative import, which could suggest malicious obfuscation or a backdoor. However, with the limited code, this remains speculative.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily performs imports, but the use of a non-descriptive function name and relative import raises suspicion of obfuscation. There is no direct evidence of malicious activity in this snippet, but caution is advised if the function source cannot be verified.",
