  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Network communication functions, environment variable access, data processing routines, logging, and standard library usage.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, environment variables, data outputs, and logging functions that could potentially leak data or be exploited.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables and network inputs flow into processing functions, with outputs potentially directed to network sockets or logs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected. Code appears standard and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes standard modules for network communication, data processing, and environment variable access. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or covert channels are evident. The network activity described is typical and not suspicious without context. The absence of obfuscation and hardcoded secrets supports a benign assessment. The low security risk score (0.2) is justified by the network activity but remains cautious. Malware score is zero, aligning with no malicious behavior. Confidence is high (0.8) for the detailed description, but overall certainty is limited by lack of actual code.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency appears benign with no evidence of malicious or obfuscated code. Security risks are minimal, primarily due to network activity, but no malicious intent is detected. Scores are consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0,
