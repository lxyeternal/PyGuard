  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a basic script that performs some form of data processing or utility function, but without additional context, the exact intent is unclear.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from user input, environment variables, or external files (if present), but since no code is provided, this cannot be confirmed.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include data output functions such as print statements, file writes, network requests, or execution of system commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as user input or environment variables to sinks through variable assignments, function calls, or data processing steps.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious API calls are detected due to lack of specific code details. The code structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "Without specific code snippets, a detailed step-by-step analysis is limited. However, based on general review practices: No signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, hidden network connections, or system manipulation are evident. No unusual language features or obfuscation techniques are apparent. The code's intention seems benign, but insufficient detail prevents full certainty.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided information, there are no clear indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears standard and does not demonstrate suspicious patterns. However, a more detailed review of the actual code content is necessary for definitive assessment.",
