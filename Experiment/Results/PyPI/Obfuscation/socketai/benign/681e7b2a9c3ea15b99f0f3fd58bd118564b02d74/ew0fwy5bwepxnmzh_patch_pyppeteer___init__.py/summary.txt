  "conclusion": "The code functions as a configuration setup for pyppeteer with obfuscated identifiers. There is no direct evidence of malicious activity, but obfuscation and unknown local modules warrant cautious review. The assigned scores are appropriate; malware risk is low, obfuscation is moderate, and overall security risk is moderate. Further inspection of the local module is recommended to confirm safety."
