The variable names are intentionally obfuscated, which is suspicious but not necessarily malicious. The environment variable is set using a value mapped from the platform, which is typical in environment configuration. The code then imports and executes a function from a local module, which could be benign or malicious. Due to obfuscation and lack of context about the imported function, there's a potential for malicious behavior, such as executing hidden payloads or malicious code within the imported module. No network activity, credential handling, or suspicious system modifications are observed directly. Overall, the code appears to be a typical setup routine but is obscured enough to warrant caution, especially given the obfuscated identifiers and local import.\"),\n  \"conclusion\": \"The code's primary function seems benign—setting an environment variable based on OS and invoking a local module function. However, obfuscated variable names and the lack of transparency about the imported module's code introduce potential risks. Without further inspection of 'patch_pyppeteer', the possibility of malicious activity cannot be ruled out.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.6,\n  \"obfuscated\": 0.7,\n  \"malware\": 0.3,\n  \"securityRisk\": 0.4\n}",
