  "sinks": "No direct sinks observed; environment variable set, local module executed",
  "flows": "OS detection -> environment variable assignment -> import and execution of local function",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable and function names, reliance on an unknown local module, setting environment variables based on OS without validation",
  "analysis": "The code detects the OS, sets a platform-specific Chromium revision environment variable, imports a local module, and executes an obfuscated function. No network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications are visible. Obfuscation reduces transparency but does not inherently indicate malicious intent. The local module's content is unknown, which warrants caution. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.2, obfuscation ~0.6, risk ~0.3) are reasonable given the evidence. The overall activity appears benign, serving as a configuration routine, but obfuscation and reliance on unverified local code suggest a need for further review of the local module.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a configuration setup for pyppeteer with obfuscated identifiers. There is no direct evidence of malicious activity, but obfuscation and unknown local modules warrant cautious review. The assigned scores are appropriate; malware risk is low, obfuscation is moderate, and overall security risk is moderate. Further inspection of the local module is recommended to confirm safety.",
