  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python module, possibly for data processing or utility functions, but the exact purpose cannot be determined without the actual code content.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables and potentially user input functions such as input() or reading files. However, without specific code, this cannot be confirmed.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, system commands, or data serialization functions that could leak data or execute malicious code. No explicit sinks are identified without actual code.",
  "flows": "Data flow from sources like environment variables or user input to sinks such as network or system functions could pose risks if untrusted data is not sanitized. Specific flow paths are not determinable from the provided snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors, are evident without the actual code content. The absence of code details limits anomaly detection.",
  "analysis": "Due to the absence of concrete code, the review is limited to general observations. No malicious or suspicious patterns can be confirmed. The code structure and usage patterns are unknown, making detailed analysis impossible.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided information, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. However, the lack of code details prevents a comprehensive assessment. The overall risk appears low, but caution should be maintained if more code is provided.",
