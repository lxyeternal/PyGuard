  "purpose": "This source code appears to be a Python package module, likely intended for general functionality or a utility library.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly evident; no external data reading functions or user input handling are present in the visible code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include network communication, file operations, or environment variable usage if present, but none are explicitly visible in the provided code.",
  "flows": "No clear source-to-sink data flows are identifiable due to lack of input or output operations in the code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no hardcoded credentials, suspicious functions, or obfuscated constructs. No unusual code patterns or hidden behaviors are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code seems to be straightforward and does not include any suspicious, malicious, or malicious-looking constructs. It lacks external data sources, unsafe data handling, or risky library usage. Since the code is minimal and standard, there is no indication of malicious intent or security issues based solely on this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious activities detected.",
