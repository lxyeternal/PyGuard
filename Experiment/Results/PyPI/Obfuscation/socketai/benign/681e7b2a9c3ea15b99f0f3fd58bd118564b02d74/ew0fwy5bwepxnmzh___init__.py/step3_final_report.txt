{
  "purpose": "To evaluate supply chain security risks and malicious behavior in the provided Python code snippets, focusing on suspicious patterns, obfuscation, and malicious activities.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, user inputs, files, network connections, and external data flows.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks involve network transmissions, file writes, environment variable access, and system calls that could leak data or execute malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or user inputs to sinks like network or file operations, with no evidence of malicious manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears straightforward with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate minimal or no code, with high confidence in benignity where code exists. The scores reflect low risk (0.2), no malware (0), and no obfuscation (0). The cautious approach for missing code (scores 0) is appropriate. The assessments are consistent and justified given the limited information.",
  "conclusion": "The code is assessed as benign with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The low security risk scores are justified, and the confidence levels are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary based on the current evidence.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.2,
