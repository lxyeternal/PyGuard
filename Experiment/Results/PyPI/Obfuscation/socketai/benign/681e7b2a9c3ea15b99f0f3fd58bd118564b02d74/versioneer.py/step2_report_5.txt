  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the provided code and the reports' assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on version control, Git info extraction, and version file management. Finds no malicious behavior, considers obfuscation benign or accidental.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's purpose: version management via Git, reading/writing files, subprocess calls. No signs of malicious activity, such as data exfiltration or sabotage, are present. The obfuscation appears minimal and likely incidental.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores seem reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Also about version management, with a note on obfuscation and complex dynamic subprocess invocation. Raises suspicion due to obfuscation but finds no malicious intent.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0.7, Confidence = 0.8.\n\n- **Assessment:** The high obfuscation score reflects the complex variable names and dynamic code. However, the core functions involve standard version control operations, with no signs of malicious payloads. The concern about obfuscation is valid but does not imply malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** The malware score of 0 is justified; obfuscation is high but benign here. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, focusing on Git interactions, version parsing, and configuration reading. Finds no malicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0.8, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, obfuscation is high, but functions are standard for version management. No signs of malicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focused on version info reading/writing, Git commands, and configuration parsing. Finds no malicious intent, only obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0.3, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n- **Assessment:** The obfuscation score is lower here, which is consistent with the code's appearance. No malicious activity detected.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, emphasizing versioning via Git, no malicious activity, some obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code's purpose and content.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified. The code is about version management, Git info extraction, and file handling—standard in build tools.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Varies from 0.2 to 0.8, depending on perceived complexity. The code contains complex variable names and templated strings, but no malicious obfuscation patterns (e.g., encrypted payloads, hidden backdoors). The high obfuscation scores in some reports seem to overstate the risk; they are likely due to auto-generated or minimized code, not malicious intent.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Consistently low (0.2), aligning with the absence of malicious activity.\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no signs of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0.3** (some obfuscation but benign)\n- **Risk:** **0.2** (low risk, standard version management functions)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports' scores are reasonable and aligned with the code's purpose. No significant adjustments are necessary. The overall security posture based on this analysis is that the code is legitimate, with obfuscation likely accidental or templated, and no malware present.",
