  "purpose": "Module imports internal classes/functions with obfuscated names and defines __all__ for public API.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.event, .group, etc.) with obfuscated identifiers.",
  "sinks": "No external data sources, network activity, or untrusted sinks present.",
  "flows": "Static import of obfuscated identifiers, exporting via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of internal class/function names, which is unusual but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module interface with heavily obfuscated internal identifiers. No dynamic behavior, external data handling, or network activity is evident. The obfuscation raises suspicion but could be autogenerated or for internal concealment. All reports correctly identify the obfuscated names and lack of malicious activity. Malware scores are appropriately zero; obfuscation scores are high (~0.7-0.8), reflecting suspicion. Risk scores are low (~0.2), acknowledging obfuscation but no active threats. Given the static nature and absence of malicious indicators, the code appears benign, though obfuscation warrants further review of the imported modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is a standard module interface with heavily obfuscated internal identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. Obfuscation alone does not imply malicious intent but warrants further review of the imported modules. The low malware and risk scores are justified; the obfuscation warrants caution but does not indicate malicious behavior.",
