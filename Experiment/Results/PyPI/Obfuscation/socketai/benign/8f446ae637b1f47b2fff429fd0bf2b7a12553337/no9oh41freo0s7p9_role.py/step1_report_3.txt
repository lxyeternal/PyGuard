  "purpose": "Define a Pydantic data model with aliasing for the 'uid' field and a string representation method.",
  "sources": "The 'Field' function from pydantic for the 'uid' attribute; the class constructor for instantiation.",
  "sinks": "The __str__ method outputs a formatted string; no external sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Data is set via 'uid' and 'name' attributes; the __str__ method constructs a string output from these attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward Pydantic model with an alias 'id' for 'uid' and a custom string representation. No external data sources, sinks, or flows that could lead to security issues are present. No malicious behavior, code injection, or data leakage mechanisms are evident. The code appears to be purely structural and descriptive.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard data model definition using Pydantic with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
