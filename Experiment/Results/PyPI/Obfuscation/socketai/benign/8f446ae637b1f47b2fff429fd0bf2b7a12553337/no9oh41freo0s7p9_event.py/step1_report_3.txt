  "purpose": "Define data models for event management, including event details and responses, with conditional imports based on Python version.",
  "sources": "Standard library imports (sys, datetime, enum), third-party libraries (pydantic, typing_extensions), and relative import (.types_).",
  "sinks": "None present; code does not include network access, file operations, or untrusted data sinks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input data dictionaries into model constructors, with no external or untrusted data flows or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class and method names; no obvious malicious logic or backdoors; property methods perform simple attribute access and URL generation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several Pydantic models for event data, with conditional imports for type hints based on Python version. The models include fields for event details, lists of user IDs, and methods for string representation and URL generation. The import statements are standard, and the class/method names appear intentionally obfuscated but do not perform any suspicious operations. No network, file, or external command execution is present. No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or malicious logic are evident. Overall, the code is a typical data model definition with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign, intended for data modeling in an event management context. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security vulnerabilities, or malicious data handling within this module.",
