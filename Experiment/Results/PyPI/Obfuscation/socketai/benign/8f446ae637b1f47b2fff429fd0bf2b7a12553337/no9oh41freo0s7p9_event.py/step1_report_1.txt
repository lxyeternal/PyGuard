  "purpose": "Define data models for event management with properties and utility methods.",
  "sources": "Reads data from external JSON/dictionary input via the WjxiXFQgjFEvIfTvIJPzxuPNnMGfZTzY class method.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; only internal property access and string formatting are used.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input dictionary into class instances, with no external system calls or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscation detected. The code uses dynamic class method to instantiate from JSON, which is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple data models and enums using Pydantic and standard Python libraries. It includes conditional imports based on Python version, which is normal. The models contain fields with aliases, some optional booleans, and methods for string representation and URL generation. No external network calls, eval, exec, or similar risky functions are used. The class method WjxiXFQgjFEvIfTvIJPzxuPNnMGfZTzY simply constructs an object from a dictionary input, with no unsafe behavior. Overall, the code appears to be straightforward data modeling with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical data model implementation for handling event data, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
