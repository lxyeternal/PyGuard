{
  "purpose": "Define a type alias 'DictFromJSON' as a dictionary with string keys and any values for type hinting purposes.",
  "sources": "No data sources; the code imports 'Any' and 'TypeAlias' from 'typing' and defines a type alias.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external interactions; the code is purely a type alias declaration.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code does not process or transfer data at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static type alias declaration with no runtime behavior, data processing, or external calls. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No anomalies or suspicious features are present. The confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and contains no security issues or malicious behavior. The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
