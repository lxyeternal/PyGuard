  "purpose": "Define a type alias for dictionaries with string keys and values of any type, likely for JSON data handling.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data sources are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or output operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths from sources to sinks are present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports type annotations and defines a type alias 'DictFromJSON' for a dictionary with string keys and any type of values. There are no functions, data processing, or external interactions. The code serves as a type hinting utility without execution or side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward type aliasing with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a benign and standard coding pattern.",
