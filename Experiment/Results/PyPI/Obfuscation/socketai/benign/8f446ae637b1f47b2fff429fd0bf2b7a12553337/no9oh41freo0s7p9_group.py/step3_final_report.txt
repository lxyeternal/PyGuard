{
  "purpose": "Defines a group data model with members, roles, and subgroups, providing lookup methods for each.",
  "sources": "Reads data from internal lists: members, roles, subgroups; uses method parameters for lookup IDs.",
  "sinks": "No external data leaks, network activity, or file I/O; internal lookups and exception raising.",
  "flows": "Source data (list of members/roles/subgroups) to lookup methods, raising exceptions if not found.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation through variable and method names; no malicious code or secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward data model with lookup functions, standard imports, and no external communication. Obfuscation appears superficial, likely to hinder readability but not to conceal malicious intent. No signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration are present. The exception handling is standard, and the logic is simple and clear despite variable name obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated data model with no evidence of malicious activity. The high obfuscation score is justified, but overall security risk remains very low. Malware score is 0, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.",
