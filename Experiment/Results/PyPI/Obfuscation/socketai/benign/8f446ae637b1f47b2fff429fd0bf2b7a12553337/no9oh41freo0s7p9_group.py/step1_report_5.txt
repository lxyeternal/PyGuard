  "purpose": "Defines a data model for managing groups, members, roles, and subgroups with methods for retrieval and validation.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and classes; reads environment information from sys and external modules; processes data passed into class methods.",
  "sinks": "Potential data access via methods that retrieve members, roles, or subgroups by UID; no direct untrusted data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input dictionaries into object creation; then methods query internal lists for specific UID matches.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. The class uses dynamic string formatting but no evident obfuscation or malicious obfuscation techniques.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with conditional import statements based on Python version, which is standard. It defines a Pydantic model with various fields and methods for retrieving members, roles, and subgroups by their UID. Methods perform straightforward lookups with error handling. No external network access, code injection, or malicious side-effects are present. The code appears well-structured, with clear purpose and no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are evident. The use of exceptions for lookup failures is appropriate and does not introduce security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code defines a clean, purpose-driven data model with safe lookup methods. No malicious activity or security risks are apparent. The code appears safe and legitimate for its intended function.",
