{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for a Python package, intended to configure package metadata and installation parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; uses hardcoded strings for package info; no external data sources or inputs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output operations identified.",
  "flows": "N/A; the script primarily defines package metadata without data flow or processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of variable names; presence of an invalid parameter 'meHMXlbOUvulmvvdBKGyEZEgAECXFvlB=False' in setup(), which would cause execution failure; inconsistent parameter naming; potential attempt to hide intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names, which raises suspicion but does not inherently indicate malicious activity. The invalid parameter suggests a mistake or an attempt to conceal malicious payloads. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or malicious functions are present. The obfuscation could be benign or malicious; further static or dynamic analysis is recommended. The reports are empty, providing no additional context. The invalid parameter impacts functionality but does not directly imply malicious intent. Overall, the code's obfuscation and syntax issues warrant caution, but no active malware or security vulnerabilities are evident from this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a heavily obfuscated setup configuration with a syntax error due to an invalid parameter. There is no direct evidence of malicious behavior, but the obfuscation and anomalies suggest potential intent to hide or complicate analysis. The package should be reviewed and corrected before use. The malware score is low, but obfuscation and syntax issues merit a moderate security concern.",
