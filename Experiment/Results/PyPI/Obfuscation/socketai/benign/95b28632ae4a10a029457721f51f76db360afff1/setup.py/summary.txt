  "conclusion": "The script is a heavily obfuscated setup configuration with a syntax error due to an invalid parameter. There is no direct evidence of malicious behavior, but the obfuscation and anomalies suggest potential intent to hide or complicate analysis. The package should be reviewed and corrected before use. The malware score is low, but obfuscation and syntax issues merit a moderate security concern."
