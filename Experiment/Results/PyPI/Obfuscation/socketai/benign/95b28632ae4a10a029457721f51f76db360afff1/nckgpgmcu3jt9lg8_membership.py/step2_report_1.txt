  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports confirm that the code is a simple constant declaration (`RENEWAL_ALLOWED_WITH_DAYS_LEFT: int = 40`) with no data input, output, or complex logic. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.  \n   **Conclusion**: The code itself is benign and straightforward.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis. They correctly identify that this is a static constant declaration with no security concerns. No errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign a malware score of 0, security risk of 0, and obfuscation score of 0, which aligns with the code's nature. The confidence levels are all high (1 or 1.0), which is appropriate given the simplicity of the code.  \n   **Suggestion**: No changes needed; scores are reasonable and consistent.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since the code is purely a constant declaration with no external interactions, no input/output, and no suspicious patterns, the risk score should remain at 0. The current scores reflect that accurately.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct. There is no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions and stick to the facts—this is just a constant declaration.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's nature: no obfuscation, no malware, no security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (correct; no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (correct; code is clear)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (correct; no security risk)\n\n### Overall Justification:\n\nGiven the simplicity and benign nature of this code snippet, I agree with the current scores. There is no evidence to suggest any malicious intent or security concern. The constant appears to be a configuration parameter used in broader application logic, which is common and safe.\n\n**Summary**:  \n- The code is a straightforward constant declaration.  \n- No issues or suspicious activity are present.  \n- Scores are appropriate and should remain as-is.\n\n**Final recommendation**: Keep the scores at malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0.",
