  "purpose": "A simple constant declaration used as a configuration parameter for renewal logic.",
  "sources": "The code reads a hardcoded integer value assigned to a variable; no external input or data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flows that could lead to data leaks or security effects, as the code is a static constant.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is a static assignment with no dynamic data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward and clear.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple constant declaration with no functions, input/output, or external dependencies. All reports agree that it is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The malware score is correctly set to 0, as there is no malicious activity. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and clarity of the code. The scores for obfuscation and security risk are also 0, consistent with the analysis. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected. The code's purpose appears to be a configuration parameter, and there is no evidence to suggest any security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward constant declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. The existing reports and scores are accurate and appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
