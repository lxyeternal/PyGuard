  "purpose": "Define a constant for the number of days left to allow renewal",
  "sources": "None, as it is a simple constant assignment",
  "sinks": "None, no data flow or untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "None",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is a straightforward constant declaration with no unusual or suspicious elements",
  "analysis": "The code declares a single integer constant named RENEWAL_ALLOWED_WITH_DAYS_LEFT with a value of 40. It involves no input handling, no data processing, no external communication, and no suspicious behavior. The code appears to be part of a larger codebase where this constant might be used for business logic related to renewal periods.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a simple constant declaration with no malicious intent, no suspicious or malicious behavior detected. It is benign and typical of configuration or parameter setting in Python projects.",
