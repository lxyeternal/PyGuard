  "purpose": "Define a NamedTuple for different user roles and create instances representing various user types with their codes, descriptions, and dues.",
  "sources": "Constants for role codes, descriptions, and dues; instances of NamedTuple with role data.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data flows; no external network or file operations present.",
  "flows": "Data is assigned from constants to NamedTuple instances, no data flows from untrusted sources or to untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or hidden behaviors; code appears straightforward and purely data definition.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a NamedTuple class with three fields and creates multiple instances representing different user categories, each with code, description, and dues. All data are hardcoded string and integer literals, with no dynamic input, network activity, or obfuscated logic. No indications of malicious behavior or security risks are evident from the provided code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely defines data structures and instances for role management. There are no signs of malware, malicious intent, or security risks. The code is benign and appears to serve as a static data configuration.",
