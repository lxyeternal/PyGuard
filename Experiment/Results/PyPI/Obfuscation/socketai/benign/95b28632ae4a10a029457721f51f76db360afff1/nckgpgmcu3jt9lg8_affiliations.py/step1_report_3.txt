{
  "purpose": "Define a NamedTuple class for representing various user roles and instantiate several role objects with associated codes, descriptions, and dues.",
  "sources": "Data sources are hardcoded in the form of NamedTuple instances with role codes, descriptions, and dues.",
  "sinks": "No external data inputs, no output functions, no network or file operations, no data leaks, and no untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "The code initializes static data objects; there are no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The role data is hardcoded, but there are no signs of suspicious or malicious content such as embedded scripts, obfuscated code, or secret keys.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a NamedTuple class and creates several instances representing roles with codes, descriptions, and associated dues. All data are statically defined within the script. There is no input validation, external data processing, or dynamic code execution. No network or file operations are present. The structure appears to be a straightforward data setup without any hidden or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as static configuration or role definitions with no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation detected. The data is hardcoded, which is typical for such purposes, and no malicious activities are evident.",
