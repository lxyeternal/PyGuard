{
  "purpose": "Define a named tuple class for different categories of individuals with associated codes, descriptions, and dues, then instantiate several instances representing specific categories.",
  "sources": "No input sources or untrusted data read; all data is hardcoded within the script.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to external systems, network, files, or outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as all data is static and assigned to variables internally.",
  "anomalies": "The code primarily consists of static data definitions and class instantiation. No suspicious functions, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated logic. No hardcoded credentials or sensitive data found. No malicious patterns such as network calls, file manipulations, or environmental variable usage.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a named tuple class to categorize individuals and then creates multiple instances with hardcoded category codes, descriptions, and dues. The use of the class and instances appears to be for data management purposes. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or system manipulation. The code is straightforward and static, without dynamic or suspicious code constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a static data structure setup for categorizing individuals. There are no indicators of malicious intent, malware, or security risks present.",
