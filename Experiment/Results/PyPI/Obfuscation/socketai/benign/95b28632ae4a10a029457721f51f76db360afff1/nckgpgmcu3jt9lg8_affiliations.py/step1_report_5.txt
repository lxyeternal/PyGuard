{
  "purpose": "Define and instantiate a set of membership or status records with identifiers, descriptions, and associated integer values.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from hardcoded string literals and integer literals assigned during instantiation of namedtuples.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are explicitly present; the data are stored in variables and data structures with no external communication or output functions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from hardcoded values into namedtuple instances, collected into a list for potential future use.",
  "anomalies": "All data are hardcoded with no dynamic input or external data retrieval. No suspicious or hidden code structures are evident. Variable names are nonsensical but do not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a NamedTuple class with three fields, then creates multiple instances with static values representing different membership types. These instances are collected into a list. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no external outputs, and no complex logic or control flow that could be exploited. The variable names are obfuscated, but this appears to be a stylistic choice rather than malicious intent. The data seem to serve as configuration or categorization data without any malicious or harmful behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and appears to be intended for categorizing or managing membership statuses. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks.",
