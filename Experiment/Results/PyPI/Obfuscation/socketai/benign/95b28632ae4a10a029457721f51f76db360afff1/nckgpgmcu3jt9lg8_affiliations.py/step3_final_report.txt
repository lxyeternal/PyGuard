{
  "purpose": "Defines a NamedTuple class for user roles and creates static instances representing different categories with associated codes, descriptions, and dues.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string literals and integer values assigned during instance creation.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, no data sinks, no external I/O or network activity.",
  "flows": "Static data assigned to variables; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are obfuscated or nonsensical, but this appears stylistic rather than malicious; no suspicious code patterns or obfuscation techniques beyond naming.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines a data structure and populates it with static, hardcoded data. There is no dynamic input, output, network activity, or code execution. Variable naming obfuscation is minimal and stylistic, not malicious. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, securityRisk near 0, obfuscated low) are consistent with the static, benign nature of the code. The slight obfuscation in variable names justifies a marginally higher obfuscation score (around 0.2), but it does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static data setup for user roles or categories, with no malicious or security concerns. The scoring in the reports is appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. No modifications are necessary.",
