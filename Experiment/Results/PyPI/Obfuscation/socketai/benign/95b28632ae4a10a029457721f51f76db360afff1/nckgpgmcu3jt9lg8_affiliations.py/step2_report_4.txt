  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code consists solely of static data definitions: a NamedTuple class and several instances with hardcoded strings and integers.\n- No dynamic input, network activity, file I/O, or code execution.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or embedded malicious code.\n- Variable names are mostly nonsensical or obfuscated, but this appears stylistic rather than malicious.\n- The code's purpose seems to be defining static role or category data.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose:** Define roles with codes and descriptions.\n- **Analysis:** Straightforward static data setup.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both 0.\n- **Conclusion:** No security risks or malicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning is sound. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose:** Define categories of individuals.\n- **Analysis:** Static data, no external interactions, no suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** Both 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign static data.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct assessment. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose:** Define roles and instantiate role objects.\n- **Analysis:** Static data, no external data or dynamic code.\n- **Scores:** Both 0.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. The scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose:** Define user roles with codes, descriptions, and dues.\n- **Analysis:** Static data, no external interactions.\n- **Scores:** Both 0.\n- **Conclusion:** No security risks or malware.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid assessment.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose:** Define membership/status records with identifiers and values.\n- **Analysis:** Static data, variable names obfuscated but no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, securityRisk 0.1, obfuscated 0.2.\n- **Discussion of obfuscation:** Variable names are nonsensical but this is likely stylistic or obfuscation, not malicious.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly above zero (0.1), but this could be due to obfuscation rather than malicious intent.\n- **Malware:** 0, no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Conclusion:** The code appears benign, with obfuscation as the only minor concern.\n\n**Verdict:** The obfuscation score (0.2) is reasonable given the variable names, but it’s not malicious. The securityRisk score (0.1) is marginally above zero, justified by the obfuscation. No malware detected.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of scoring consistency:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify the code as static data with no malicious behavior.\n- The scores for malware (all 0) are appropriate.\n- The obfuscation scores are minimal, justified by variable names.\n- The security risk scores are zero or marginally above zero, justified by the obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0 for all reports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Slightly higher for report 5 (0.2) due to variable names, which is justified.\n- **Risk score:** All are 0 or very close to 0, which is appropriate given the static nature.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.2 for report 5, 0 for others.\n- **Risk:** 0 for all, possibly 0.1 for report 5 due to obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are thorough, and their scoring aligns well with the static, benign nature of the code. No changes are necessary.",
