{
  "purpose": "Define a NamedTuple for different user roles and create a list of role instances with associated codes and descriptions.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded string literals and assigns them to variables defining user roles and their attributes.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or untrusted data handling present; no external data inputs or outputs are shown.",
  "flows": "Data flows from hardcoded role attributes into NamedTuple instances stored in variables and a list.",
  "anomalies": "All data are hardcoded, with no input handling or dynamic code execution. No suspicious or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a NamedTuple class representing user roles with associated codes, descriptions, and dues. Several instances of this class are created with static data and stored in variables. These variables are then aggregated into a list. The code does not perform any I/O, network communication, or dynamic code execution. It appears to be a simple data structure definition and initialization, with no malicious behavior or security risks evident. There are no backdoors, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward static data definition with hardcoded role attributes. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
