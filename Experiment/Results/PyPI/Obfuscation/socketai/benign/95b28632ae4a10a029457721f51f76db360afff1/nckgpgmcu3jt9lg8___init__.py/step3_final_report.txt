  "purpose": "Assess open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on suspicious patterns, obfuscation, and malicious activities.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, input functions, data processing, network calls, file operations, environment variables, and any external data sources.",
  "sinks": "Network transmissions, file writes, environment variable access, system commands, or output functions that could leak data or execute malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Input sources such as environment variables or user input flow into processing functions, potentially reaching sinks like network calls or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, suspicious network domains, obfuscated code, unusual dynamic execution, or hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "All provided reports indicate benign behavior, primarily based on absence of suspicious patterns, with high confidence in reports 1 and 2. Reports 3-5 lack code but reasonably assign low confidence and scores reflecting uncertainty. Scores for malware and obfuscation are consistently zero, and security risk scores are low (~0.2), indicating minimal threat. Slight overconfidence in reports without code is noted but acceptable. Overall, assessments are consistent with the limited data, and no evidence of malicious activity is found.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no malicious or obfuscated patterns detected. Scores are appropriate, though minor adjustments to security risk scores (from 0.2 to 0.1) could better reflect minimal inherent risk. All reports are internally consistent and justified given the information.",
