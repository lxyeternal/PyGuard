{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package with JavaScript dependencies and Jupyter extensions.",
  "sources": "Reading 'package.json' for version info, reading static files for JavaScript build, and importing setup tools and packaging functions.",
  "sinks": "The code primarily prepares build steps and package data; no immediate sinks for untrusted data or malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "The version info flows from 'package.json' into setup configuration; file paths flow into build commands; build commands flow into package data setup.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes obfuscated-looking variable names with random character sequences; no clear hardcoded secrets or malicious logic present. The use of dynamic build commands is normal in JS-Python integrations but can sometimes hide malicious behavior, though none is evident here.",
  "analysis": "The script loads package version from 'package.json', constructs paths for JavaScript and Jupyter extension files, and defines build steps for JavaScript assets using 'create_cmdclass' and related functions. The variable names are obfuscated but the operations are standard for building Jupyter extensions. No suspicious network activity, code injection, or backdoors are evident. The code appears to be a typical setup script for a Jupyter widget extension with frontend assets. The obfuscated variable names are likely just code obfuscation or code style and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script performs typical package configuration tasks for a Jupyter extension with JavaScript components. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The only concern is the obfuscated variable names, which seem to be a form of code obfuscation but do not affect the security assessment.",
