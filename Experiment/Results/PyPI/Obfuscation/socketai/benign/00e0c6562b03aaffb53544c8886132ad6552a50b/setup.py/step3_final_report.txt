  "purpose": "Setup script for a Jupyter Notebook/Lab extension package, managing JavaScript assets and versioning.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'package.json', defines paths for JS assets, and executes build commands via 'jupyter_packaging'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or network activity; primarily file operations and build commands.",
  "flows": "Loads version info -> defines paths -> runs npm/yarn build -> copies static assets -> sets up package data.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy variable name obfuscation, but no malicious code, network activity, or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup for a Jupyter extension, with obfuscated variable names likely due to auto-generation or minification. No signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, network exfiltration, or backdoors. The build process uses common tools and practices. Obfuscation is superficial and does not imply malicious intent. The absence of network calls, secrets, or malicious logic supports a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, standard setup for a Jupyter extension with JavaScript assets. Despite obfuscated variable names, there is no evidence of malware or security vulnerabilities. The high obfuscation score reflects variable naming but does not indicate malicious intent. Overall security risk is low.",
