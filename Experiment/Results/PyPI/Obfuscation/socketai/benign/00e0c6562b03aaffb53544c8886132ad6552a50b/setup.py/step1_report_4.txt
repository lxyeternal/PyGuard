{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package with JavaScript frontend components, including npm dependencies and Jupyter extension installation.",
  "sources": "Reading 'version' from 'package.json'; reading package metadata; loading JSON files for configuration; reading files for JavaScript build targets.",
  "sinks": "File operations for configuration; execution of npm commands; package setup functions.",
  "flows": "Load version info from JSON -> configure npm build and target files -> execute npm install -> run package setup.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors observed. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily prepares package metadata and static assets for a Jupyter extension using standard setup tools and npm commands. It loads version info from a JSON file, defines paths for JavaScript sources, and configures build and installation steps for frontend assets. The use of 'create_cmdclass', 'install_npm', and 'ensure_targets' is consistent with common practices for Jupyter extension packaging. No malicious code, backdoors, or data leakage mechanisms are present. All operations are related to package configuration and build automation. There is no evidence of malware, malicious data exfiltration, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate setup code for a Jupyter package with frontend assets. It performs expected tasks such as loading configuration, building JavaScript assets, and registering extensions. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected based on the provided code.",
