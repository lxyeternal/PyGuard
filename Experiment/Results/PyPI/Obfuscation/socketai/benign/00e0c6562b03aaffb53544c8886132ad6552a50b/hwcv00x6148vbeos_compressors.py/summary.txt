  "confidence": 0.85,
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of obfuscated wrapper classes around standard compression libraries, with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The obfuscation is suspicious but not malicious. The overall security risk is low, and malware likelihood is negligible. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with this analysis."
