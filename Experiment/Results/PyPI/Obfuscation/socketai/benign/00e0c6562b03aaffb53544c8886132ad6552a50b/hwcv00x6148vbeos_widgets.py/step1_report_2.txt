{
  "purpose": "Defines custom IPython widgets for displaying tables with configurable data and models, likely for interactive data visualization.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class attribute initializations, and constructor methods that set class properties.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; code primarily initializes class attributes and constructs widget instances.",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor arguments to class properties; no external data handling or untrusted sources evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns; usage of standard libraries and straightforward class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two widget classes with attributes synchronized with frontend models, using traitlets and ipywidgets. All data appears to be class configuration or model setup with no input/output handling, external network communication, or obfuscated constructs. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are present. The code looks like standard widget setup for Jupyter notebooks without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be legitimate widget definitions intended for data visualization in a Jupyter environment. There are no indications of malicious or sabotage behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious data flows.",
