{
  "purpose": "Defines two custom Jupyter widgets for displaying and interacting with tabular data, with configurable properties.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (json, pandas, traitlets, ipywidgets) and reads class attributes and constructor parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data can flow from input parameters (table, wg, sjCWKyqXKVOvmZYeEJwHccECdkovettn) to widget properties.",
  "flows": "Input parameters 'table', 'wg', and 'sjCWKyqXKVOvmZYeEJwHccECdkovettn' assigned to widget attributes, which are synchronized to frontend via traitlets.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class names, variable names, and the presence of a class that stores data in widget properties. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two widget classes, registering them with ipywidgets. Attributes are set up with default values or passed-in parameters. No network operations, file I/O, or external data manipulation are present. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection are observed. The code appears to be straightforward widget definitions, although the naming obfuscation might raise suspicion about intent. However, functionality aligns with standard widget setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be standard widget definitions with obfuscated names but no malicious intent or security issues. It mainly sets up display components for Jupyter notebooks. No malware or security risks detected.",
