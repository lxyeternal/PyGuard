{
  "purpose": "The code defines two custom IPython widget classes for use in Jupyter notebooks, likely for displaying or interacting with table data.",
  "sources": "Imports modules, class initializers, and class attribute assignments, which read class attributes and module data.",
  "sinks": "Class attribute assignments and constructor methods assign data to class attributes; no direct untrusted data sinks such as network or file I/O are evident.",
  "flows": "Initialization of class attributes from constructor parameters and static string assignments, with data assigned to class properties, but no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated class and variable names, but no obvious malicious code like network activity, file manipulation, or backdoors. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to define IPython widgets with obfuscated class and attribute names. These classes primarily initialize widget properties, some of which are set from parameters. All data flows are confined within the class initialization and attribute assignments. No external network connections, file operations, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The obfuscated naming might suggest an attempt to conceal intent, but without additional context or dynamic code execution, there are no signs of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is likely intended to create custom Jupyter widgets for displaying tables or related data, with obfuscated identifiers but no evidence of malicious or sabotage behavior. It appears to be a benign widget definition with no malicious intent.",
