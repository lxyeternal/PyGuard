{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom Jupyter widgets using ipywidgets and traitlets, primarily for display and interaction within notebooks.",
  "sources": "Widget class attribute definitions, constructor parameters assigning to widget attributes.",
  "sinks": "No external data sources, network calls, or untrusted data flows are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor parameters into widget attributes; no external sinks or data exfiltration observed.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names, but no malicious code or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two widget classes with attributes mostly for configuration and display. No network activity, file I/O, or code injection is present. Obfuscation appears stylistic or proprietary rather than malicious. The scores assigned in the reports align with the benign nature of the code, with high obfuscation scores justified by naming conventions but no malicious intent. Malware score is zero across all reports, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior. Risk scores are low, reflecting the lack of external data handling or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom Jupyter widgets with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious activity, security vulnerabilities, or data leaks. The obfuscation is likely stylistic, and overall, the supply chain security risk is negligible.",
