  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, albeit obfuscated, implementation of a trait type with validation and notification. No evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities is present. The primary concern is the external module, which should be reviewed separately. The malware score remains at 0, and the obfuscation score is high but justified. Overall, the code is safe but warrants caution regarding the external dependency."
