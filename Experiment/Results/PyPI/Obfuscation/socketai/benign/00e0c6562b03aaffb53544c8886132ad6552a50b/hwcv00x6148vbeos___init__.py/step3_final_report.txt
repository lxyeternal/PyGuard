  "sinks": "Return values of functions, warning message output.",
  "flows": "Imports → functions returning configuration data or warnings.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names, undefined variables such as 'npm_module_name' and 'SOyGGWMxVxyVDxUWDxtNoKvjTlgrkhjf', use of string that appears obfuscated or random.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of configuration functions and a warning message, with import statements that use obfuscated identifiers. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or credential handling is present. The obfuscated names and undefined variables suggest either code concealment or incomplete code snippets, but there is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or harmful operations. The warning message contains a string that appears obfuscated but does not indicate malicious intent. The overall structure indicates benign configuration for Jupyter extensions, with obfuscation being a red flag but not proof of malicious activity. The malware score is appropriately 0, as no malicious actions are detected. The obfuscation score is high (~0.7) due to the naming, and the security risk score is low (~0.2), reflecting the benign nature but acknowledging potential issues with obfuscation and undefined variables.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as configuration for Jupyter extensions, with obfuscated identifiers that could be for concealment. There is no evidence of malware or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, and no immediate action is necessary. Further review of the larger codebase is recommended to clarify the purpose of obfuscation and undefined variables, but based on this snippet alone, the security posture is low risk.",
