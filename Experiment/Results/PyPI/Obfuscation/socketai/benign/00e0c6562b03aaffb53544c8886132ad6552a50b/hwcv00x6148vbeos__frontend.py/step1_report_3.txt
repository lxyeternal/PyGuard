{
  "purpose": "Import a version identifier and define a string and a formatted version string, likely for package metadata or internal use.",
  "sources": "The import statement from ._version, and the string assignment to 'wGptLlFhwWbuFQxkzHfRFBJPDHkvLizM'.",
  "sinks": "The string assignment to 'wGptLlFhwWbuFQxkzHfRFBJPDHkvLizM' could be used in a pattern match or logging, but no direct sink is present.",
  "flows": "Imported version is used to generate a version pattern string; no flow from untrusted sources to sinks is evident.",
  "anomalies": "The imported name 'exbRBPoGmZDqCSarvWiMeKEdlORbgxKA' appears obfuscated, which is suspicious, but it is imported directly from a local module without any use of dynamic execution or external data.",
  "analysis": "The code imports an obfuscated variable name from a local module, which could be an attempt to hide malicious or sensitive data. The string assignment is straightforward and seems to serve as metadata. There are no apparent network calls, file operations, or dynamic code execution. The obfuscated import name warrants suspicion, but without further context, it does not demonstrate malicious behavior. The overall structure is minimal and does not contain malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be harmless, involving metadata definitions and a suspiciously obfuscated import name. No malicious actions are evident in this snippet, but the obfuscated import could indicate an attempt to hide something in a larger context.",
