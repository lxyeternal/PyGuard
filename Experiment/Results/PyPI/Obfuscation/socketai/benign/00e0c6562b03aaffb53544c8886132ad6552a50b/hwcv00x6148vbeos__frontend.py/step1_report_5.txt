{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define some variables and import a version string, likely for package versioning or module identification.",
  "sources": "The import statement from ._version, which retrieves 'exbRBPoGmZDqCSarvWiMeKEdlORbgxKA', and the assignment of variables 'SOyGGWMxVxyVDxUWDxtNoKvjTlgrkhjf' and 'wGptLlFhwWbuFQxkzHfRFBJPDHkvLizM'.",
  "sinks": "Potential sink is the use of '__version__' in the f-string, which could be manipulated if '__version__' is not controlled, but in this code, '__version__' is used directly.",
  "flows": "The import of 'exbRBPoGmZDqCSarvWiMeKEdlORbgxKA' from _version, then its potential use in constructing the version string, but '__version__' is not explicitly assigned in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The imported variable 'exbRBPoGmZDqCSarvWiMeKEdlORbgxKA' and the variable names appear obfuscated or randomly generated, which could be a sign of obfuscation or malicious intent. The code does not perform any obvious malicious actions, but the obfuscated naming warrants caution.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a variable with a random name from a local module '_version', possibly to retrieve version info. It assigns a string indicating the package type. It then creates a formatted string with '__version__', which is typically a module attribute indicating version. The obfuscated variable names and lack of context could be a way to hide malicious intent, but as written, there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior. The code's purpose seems benign, but the obfuscation raises suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly obfuscated with random variable names, but it does not contain explicit malicious behavior or supply chain threats in this fragment. The main concern is the obfuscation itself, which could be hiding malicious intent if more context were available. Overall, low likelihood of malicious activity based on this snippet alone.",
