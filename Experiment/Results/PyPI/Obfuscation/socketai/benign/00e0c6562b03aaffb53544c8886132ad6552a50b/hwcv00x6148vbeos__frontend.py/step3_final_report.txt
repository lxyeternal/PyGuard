{
  "purpose": "The code imports an obfuscated variable from a local version module, assigns a string 'jupyter-tablewidgets' to an obfuscated variable, and constructs a version string using __version__.",
  "sources": "Import from ._version, assignment of string to obfuscated variable, use of __version__",
  "sinks": "None; no external data flow, network activity, or data exfiltration observed",
  "flows": "Import source to variable assignment, variable to version string formatting",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, import from a similarly obfuscated module, use of __version__ without definition in snippet",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, involving obfuscated variable names and version handling typical in package setup. No malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection is evident. The obfuscation appears to be a packaging or internal naming choice rather than malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, low security risk, high obfuscation) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The absence of malicious indicators, combined with the standard versioning pattern, supports a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as part of package version management with obfuscated variable names. No malicious activity or security threats are evident. The high obfuscation score is justified but does not indicate malicious intent. The current malware score of 0 and low security risk are appropriate.",
