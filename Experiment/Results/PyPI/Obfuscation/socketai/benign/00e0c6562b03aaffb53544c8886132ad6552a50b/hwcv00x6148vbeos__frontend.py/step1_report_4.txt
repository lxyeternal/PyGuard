{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define some module-level variables and import a version string from a local module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from ._version, assignment of string variables",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data output or external data transmission",
  "flows": "Imported version variable used to construct a string pattern; no flow to external sinks",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names (e.g., exbRBPoGmZDqCSarvWiMeKEdlORbgxKA) which could suggest obfuscation, but no actual malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a variable from a local module, likely a version string, and assigns it to a variable. It also defines a string containing 'jupyter-tablewidgets' and constructs a regex pattern using an undefined variable __version__, which appears to be intended as a version string. The variable names are unusual and could be obfuscation attempts, but there is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or system manipulation. There are no external network calls, no hardcoded credentials, and no suspicious logic beyond obfuscated variable names.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple, primarily involving variable assignments and an import. The unusual variable names may suggest obfuscation, but there is no indication of malicious intent or malicious behavior within this snippet.",
