    "Use of obfuscated variable names which hinder code clarity and review"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code imports a variable with an obfuscated name from a local module '_version', likely representing a version string or number. It then defines a string 'jupyter-tablewidgets' and constructs another string that includes '__version__', but '__version__' is not explicitly defined in this fragment, suggesting it might be a global or external variable. The code appears to be setting up version-related data for a package, with no evident input/output, data handling, or execution of external commands. The obfuscation of variable names and lack of clear function or logic makes it suspicious but not definitively malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard versioning setup with obfuscated variable names, possibly to hinder easy review. There is no clear malicious behavior or security risk present in this fragment, but the obfuscation warrants caution. Overall, it seems to be benign.",
