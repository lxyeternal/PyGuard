  "purpose": "Load a JSII assembly for an AWS UI React TypeScript website and publish the package.",
  "sources": "Import statements, jsii.JSIIAssembly.load() call, publication.publish()",
  "sinks": "No external data flows or network activity; static setup code",
  "flows": "Assembly load and publish functions, no external data or untrusted input flows",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable name assigned to assembly load result, likely auto-generated",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, loads a specific JSII assembly, assigns it to an obfuscated variable, and publishes the package. There is no dynamic input, network activity, or data exfiltration. The obfuscated variable name is typical of generated code, not malicious. The assembly load is from a known, legitimate package. Overall, the code functions as a standard setup script with no malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script for loading and publishing a JSII assembly, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The obfuscated variable name is typical of generated code and does not indicate malicious intent.",
