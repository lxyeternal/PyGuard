{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup.py script used for packaging and publishing a Python project, including custom commands for building and uploading distributions.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from __init__.py, requirements from requirements.txt, and README.md; executes build/upload/tag commands via os.system.",
  "sinks": "os.system calls for build, upload, and git tagging operations.",
  "flows": "Source files (version, requirements, README) feed into setup configuration; static shell commands executed via os.system for deployment steps.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and method names; use of os.system with static commands; incomplete regex in version extraction (missing parentheses).",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard packaging setup with obfuscation for concealment. No network activity, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The use of os.system is a security concern but is controlled and static. The obfuscation hinders readability but does not indicate malicious intent. The regex for version extraction appears standard but is incomplete in the snippet, which would cause runtime errors. Overall, the code performs typical setup tasks with no evidence of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, obfuscated setup script with no malicious activity detected. The primary concern is maintainability and adherence to security best practices rather than active malicious intent.",
