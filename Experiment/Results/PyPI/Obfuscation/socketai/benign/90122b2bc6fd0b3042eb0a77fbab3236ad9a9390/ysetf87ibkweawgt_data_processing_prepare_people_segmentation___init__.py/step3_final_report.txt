  "purpose": "Analysis of Python package code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Use of eval/exec, network activity, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, untrusted input handling.",
  "sinks": "Potential data exfiltration, code injection points, network communication, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Sources such as eval/exec or untrusted input flow into code execution or data transmission sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec on untrusted data, hardcoded secrets, suspicious obfuscation, dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits behaviors like eval/exec on untrusted input, network activity, and obfuscation, which are indicators of potential malicious intent. Reports 2 and 5 identify these risks, assigning moderate to high scores, justified by the suspicious practices. Other reports lack such indicators, resulting in low scores. Based on the evidence, increasing the malware score for report 2 from 0.4 to 0.6 and for report 5 from 0.2 to 0.3 would better reflect the potential threat. Scores for obfuscation and security risk are consistent with the behaviors described. No confirmed malicious payloads are identified, but the risky practices warrant cautious scoring.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows signs of obfuscation and unsafe practices like eval/exec on untrusted data, which could facilitate malicious activities. While no definitive malware is confirmed, the behaviors justify elevated suspicion levels. Adjusting malware scores upward for reports 2 and 5 enhances the accuracy of the assessment. Overall, the current scores are appropriate, with minor adjustments to better reflect the potential risks.",
