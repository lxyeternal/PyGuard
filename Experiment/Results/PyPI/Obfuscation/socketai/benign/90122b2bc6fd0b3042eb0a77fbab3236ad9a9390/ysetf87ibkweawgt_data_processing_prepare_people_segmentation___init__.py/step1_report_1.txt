  "purpose": "This source code appears to be a Python script designed to perform a specific task, but without seeing the actual code content, the purpose cannot be precisely determined.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly identifiable without code content; common sources would include user input functions, file reads, environment variables, or network requests.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could be system commands, network communications, file writes, or data exfiltration points, but none can be confirmed without code details.",
  "flows": "Source-to-sink paths cannot be determined without specific code segments, but typically involve untrusted input passing into critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies can be identified without examining the actual code. Watch for hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual function calls.",
  "analysis": "Insufficient information to perform detailed analysis. Need to review actual code content for input handling, data processing, and external interactions. The absence of code prevents identification of malicious patterns or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "Unable to determine malicious behavior or security risks based solely on an empty code snippet. Please provide the code content for a thorough review.",
