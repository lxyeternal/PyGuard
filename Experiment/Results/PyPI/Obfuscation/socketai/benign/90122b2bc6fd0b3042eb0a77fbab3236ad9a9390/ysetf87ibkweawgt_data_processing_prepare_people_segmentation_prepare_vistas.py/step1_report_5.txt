  "purpose": "Process images and labels from specified folders, generate masks, and copy images to output directories.",
  "sources": "Input: command-line arguments for image, label, and output folders; reading PNG labels from the label folder.",
  "sinks": "File copying of images; writing mask images to output folder.",
  "flows": "Read labels from input folder -> generate mask -> if mask exists, copy corresponding image -> save mask image.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded color tuple for mask comparison; no evident malicious code. The variable naming is obfuscated and inconsistent, but no malicious payloads are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The script parses command-line arguments for input/output paths. It processes PNG label files, generating binary masks based on a specific color. If masks are found, it copies the corresponding original image to the output directory and saves the mask image. The code performs straightforward image processing without executing external commands or transmitting data. Variable names are intentionally obfuscated, but there is no evidence of malicious behavior or data exfiltration. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign image processing utility intended for preparing datasets or annotations. It does not contain malware or malicious intent based on the provided code. The obfuscated variable names do not imply malicious purpose but reduce readability.",
