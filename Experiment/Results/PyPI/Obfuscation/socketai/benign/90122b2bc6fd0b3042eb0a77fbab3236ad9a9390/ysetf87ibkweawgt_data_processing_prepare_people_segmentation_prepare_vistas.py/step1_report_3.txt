{
  "purpose": "The script processes images and labels in specified folders, copying and saving images based on pixel criteria.",
  "sources": "Input image folder (-i), label folder (-l), and output folder (-o); data read from image files in the specified directories.",
  "sinks": "File copying operations and image saving; potentially writing modified images to output directory.",
  "flows": "Reads images from input folder → checks pixel data → copies image files if criteria met → saves processed images to output folders.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a hard-coded RGB color tuple; variable names are obfuscated or nonsensical; no clear user input validation; no suspicious network or system calls detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily loads images, compares pixel values to a hardcoded RGB value, and copies image files if no matching pixels are found. It then saves a mask image where matching pixels are set to white. No user credentials, secrets, or network activity are present. Variable naming is obfuscated, but this does not inherently imply malicious intent. The code lacks dangerous functions like system command execution or network access. The logic appears to be image processing with file management, consistent with benign operations.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard image processing utility that filters and copies images based on pixel data. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. Variable obfuscation and lack of comments may be suspicious but are not conclusive of malicious intent.",
