{
  "purpose": "The code processes images and labels from specified directories, loading images, checking for a specific pixel color, copying images, and saving masks based on pixel values.",
  "sources": "Image files loaded via load_rgb function; pixel data accessed for comparison; filenames used for copying and saving.",
  "sinks": "File copying operations and image writing; no untrusted data flows into system commands or network activities.",
  "flows": "Image files are loaded, pixel data checked against a color; if matched, original images are copied, and masks are saved.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names; undefined variable 'label_file_name' used in file operations; incomplete code structure.",
  "analysis": "The script performs benign image processing tasks typical for dataset preparation. Obfuscated variable names suggest code obfuscation but do not imply malicious intent. The undefined variable indicates incomplete or broken code, which would cause runtime errors but does not indicate malicious behavior. No network activity, system commands, or data exfiltration are present. The pixel comparison and file operations are standard for annotation or preprocessing pipelines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign dataset processing utility with obfuscation and incomplete references. There is no evidence of malware, malicious payloads, or security risks. The obfuscation appears stylistic or accidental, not malicious.",
