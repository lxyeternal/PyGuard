{
  "purpose": "The script processes images and labels from specified folders, generating modified label images and copying corresponding image files to an output directory.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the image folder (--image_folder) and label folder (--label_folder) provided via command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "The code writes processed label images to the output label directory, copies original image files to the output image directory, and loads images using cv2 and custom functions.",
  "flows": "Input image files are loaded and processed; label images are examined for a specific color; matching labels trigger copying of original images and saving of new label images.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains an obfuscated variable name ('XtLfuGtWuzqRSInixHStYMcbvCCfIApm') which is assigned a color tuple. There are no hardcoded credentials or obvious malicious behaviors. The presence of the variable name with random characters suggests obfuscation but may be accidental. No network activity or system command execution is observed.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs file system operations—reading images, processing labels based on color, copying files, and saving new label images. It uses standard libraries like argparse, shutil, pathlib, cv2, and numpy. The variable name 'XtLfuGtWuzqRSInixHStYMcbvCCfIApm' assigned to a color tuple appears obfuscated but does not pose a security risk. The function 'load_rgb' is imported from a helper module, likely for image processing. The code checks for a specific color in label images and conditionally copies the original image and writes a new label image, which seems standard for a data preprocessing pipeline. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or malicious code segments are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign image processing script intended for dataset preparation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The obfuscated variable name is likely unintentional or stylistic. Overall, the script is safe with a low likelihood of malicious intent.",
