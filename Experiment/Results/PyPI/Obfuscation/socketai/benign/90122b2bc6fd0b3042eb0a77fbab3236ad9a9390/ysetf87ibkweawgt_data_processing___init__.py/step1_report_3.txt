  "purpose": "The code appears to be a utility module for performing calculations and handling data transformations.",
  "sources": "Input data from function parameters, environment variables, or standard input (if any).",
  "sinks": "Output via return statements, print statements, or network calls if present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions to output sinks, with no evident untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious function calls observed. No obfuscated code or unusual language features detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward functions performing calculations and data processing. No external or untrusted data sources are explicitly used. No malicious patterns, such as network activity, code execution, or data exfiltration, are visible. Usage of third-party libraries appears benign. No hardcoded secrets or anomalies detected. The structure is clear, and the code does not invoke suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard utility script with no indicators of sabotage or malware.",
