  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks based on provided code descriptions.",
  "sources": "Input sources include user input, environment variables, file reads, module imports, and data transformations.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks involve system calls, network connections, file writes, and environment variable usage.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as user input or environment variables to sinks like system calls or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate the absence of code snippets, with conclusions based solely on descriptions. Malware scores are consistently zero, matching the lack of malicious activity. Obfuscation scores are zero, aligning with no obfuscation patterns. Security risk scores are low (0.2), reflecting minimal potential risk given benign descriptions. Confidence levels are high where detailed reasoning is provided. The reasoning is consistent across reports, and scores are appropriate. No suspicious behaviors, anomalies, or malicious patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The provided assessments are accurate and justified. No evidence of malicious code or significant security risks is present. Scores are consistent with the descriptions, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
