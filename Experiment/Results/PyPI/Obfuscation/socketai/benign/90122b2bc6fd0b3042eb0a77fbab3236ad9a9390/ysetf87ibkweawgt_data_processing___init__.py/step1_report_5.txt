  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to involve importing modules and potentially setting up some environment or functionality related to system operations.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported modules and possibly from environment variables or user inputs, although specific input sources are not shown in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, network communications, or data output functions if present elsewhere in the code, but no explicit sink functions are shown in the snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from imported modules or environment/user inputs to system or network functions (if implemented), but specific flows cannot be fully determined due to the limited code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are evident in the provided snippet. The code appears standard with normal imports.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of imports, which are typical for Python scripts, and contains no visible malicious functions or suspicious patterns. Without further code, it’s difficult to identify any malicious behavior or anomalies. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious operations are detected. The structure appears conventional and does not indicate obfuscation or malware activities.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems to perform standard operations with no evidence of sabotage, backdoors, or malicious data handling.",
