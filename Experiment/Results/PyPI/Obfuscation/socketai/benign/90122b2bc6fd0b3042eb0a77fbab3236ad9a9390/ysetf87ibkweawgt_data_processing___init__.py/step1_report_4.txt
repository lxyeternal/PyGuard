  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to perform some form of data processing, possibly related to network or system operations, given the structure and variable usage.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables, function parameters, and potentially external modules or files. Specific data sources are not clearly visible due to the lack of detailed code context.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or system commands, but no explicit unsafe or untrusted data handling points are evident from the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flow from environment variables or input parameters through internal variables to function calls or external modules, with no clear indication of dangerous operations or untrusted data execution.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic execution are present. The code appears standard without unusual patterns or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The review indicates standard Python code structure, with no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated malicious logic. Usage of third-party libraries seems typical, and no suspicious network or file system operations are detected. The code does not process or handle sensitive data in a concerning manner, nor does it show signs of malware behavior.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears to be legitimate, with no malicious behavior detected. Confidence in this assessment is high.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
