The obfuscation is likely for concealment but does not imply malicious activity. The main concern is fixing the 'file_id' bug for proper execution."

      "conclusion": "The code shows signs of obfuscation and unsafe practices like eval/exec on untrusted data, which could facilitate malicious activities. While no definitive malware is confirmed, the behaviors justify elevated suspicion levels. Adjusting malware scores upward for reports 2 and 5 enhances the accuracy of the assessment. Overall, the current scores are appropriate, with minor adjustments to better reflect the potential risks."
