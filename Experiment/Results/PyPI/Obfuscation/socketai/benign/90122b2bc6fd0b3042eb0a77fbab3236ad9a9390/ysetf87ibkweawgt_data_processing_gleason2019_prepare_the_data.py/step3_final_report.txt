  "purpose": "The code is a dataset preprocessing script for image segmentation, organizing images and masks, applying LUTs, combining masks, and cleaning up images without masks.",
  "sources": "Reads image files from specified directories, loads mask images, and applies transformations.",
  "sinks": "Copies image files to target directories, writes combined masks, and deletes images if no masks are found.",
  "flows": "Loads images/masks -> applies LUTs -> combines masks via mode -> writes output -> deletes images if no masks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function and variable names; no suspicious network activity or hardcoded credentials; standard image processing operations.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard dataset organization tasks with obfuscated naming. It reads images and masks, applies LUT transformations, combines masks using statistical mode, and manages files accordingly. No malicious code, network activity, or backdoors are present. The obfuscation appears superficial, likely intended to conceal code structure rather than malicious intent. The operations are typical for data preprocessing in ML workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign dataset preprocessing utility with obfuscation that raises some caution but shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The malware score is 0, the obfuscation score is approximately 0.7, and the security risk score is about 0.2.",
