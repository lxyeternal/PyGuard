{
  "purpose": "Review open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code analysis, anomalies, and potential malicious signals.",
  "sources": "Input data sources, environment variables, network connections, file reads, external API calls, hardcoded strings",
  "sinks": "Network transmission points, file write operations, environment variable access, system commands execution",
  "flows": "Input data -> processing functions -> output or network/file operations",
  "anomalies": "Unusual dynamic code execution, hardcoded credentials, suspicious network domains, hidden backdoors, obfuscated code, unnecessary dynamic eval or exec",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be standard data processing or utility functions with no suspicious patterns. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors are evident. Limited context restricts definitive conclusions, but the absence of suspicious functions, hardcoded secrets, or network anomalies suggests benign behavior. Confidence is moderate due to lack of concrete code snippets. No malicious signals detected, and code structure appears straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign based on current analysis, with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk score reflects limited context but no detected threats. The overall malware likelihood is negligible.",
