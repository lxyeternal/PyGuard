{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a benign utility or data processing script that reads from environment variables, files, and user input, with no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, input functions, file reads, possibly network sources",
  "sinks": "Network communication functions, file writes, environment variables",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or user input to sinks like network functions or file operations",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious constructs. It reads data from typical sources and writes or transmits data without suspicious behavior. The confidence in benign nature is high (0.9). No backdoors, data leaks, or malicious network activity are evident. The absence of obfuscation and malicious patterns supports a low malware score. The potential data flow to network or file systems is standard for utility scripts, justifying a low security risk score.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or obfuscation detected. The scores reflect a low threat level, consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
