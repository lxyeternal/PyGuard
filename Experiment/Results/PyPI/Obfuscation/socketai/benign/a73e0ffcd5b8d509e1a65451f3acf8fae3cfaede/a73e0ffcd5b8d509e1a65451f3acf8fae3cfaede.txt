      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The script is a heavily obfuscated but standard package setup with C++ extension compilation. No evidence of malware or malicious activity is present. The obfuscation is suspicious but not conclusive of malicious intent. The security risk is low, and the malware score should remain at 0. The obfuscation score is high (~0.75), reflecting the nonsensical naming conventions. Overall, the code appears benign but obfuscation warrants cautious monitoring."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, complex evaluation tool for speech/text error analysis with no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. Its obfuscation is likely stylistic rather than malicious. The security risk is minimal, and the dependency can be considered safe for use."

      "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign in function but suspicious due to obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious activity in this isolated import statement. The high obfuscation warrants further review of the 'texterrors' module, but based solely on this snippet, the code does not pose a significant security threat."
