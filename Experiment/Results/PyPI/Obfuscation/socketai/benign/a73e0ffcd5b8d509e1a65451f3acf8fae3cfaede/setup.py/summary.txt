  "conclusion": "The script is a heavily obfuscated but standard package setup with C++ extension compilation. No evidence of malware or malicious activity is present. The obfuscation is suspicious but not conclusive of malicious intent. The security risk is low, and the malware score should remain at 0. The obfuscation score is high (~0.75), reflecting the nonsensical naming conventions. Overall, the code appears benign but obfuscation warrants cautious monitoring."
