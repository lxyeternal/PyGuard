{
  "purpose": "The code implements a comprehensive speech/text alignment and error analysis framework, calculating metrics such as WER and CER, and generating detailed reports with optional color coding and grouping features.",
  "sources": "Reads input files (reference, hypothesis, OOV list, group mappings, keywords), and external modules like texterrors_align, numpy, loguru, termcolor.",
  "sinks": "Outputs detailed reports to files or stdout, including alignment results, error statistics, and error analysis logs.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into alignment and error calculation functions; results are processed, logged, and written to output files or console; error metrics are aggregated and summarized.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of variable names, extensive nested functions, and complex control flow; no network activity, system modifications, or secret credentials detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a complex, obfuscated utility for speech/text error analysis, performing alignment, error counting, and detailed reporting. No malicious patterns such as network calls, data exfiltration, or system sabotage are present. Obfuscation appears stylistic or for code concealment, not malicious intent. The extensive logging and file I/O are consistent with a diagnostic or research tool. The malware score is 0, and the obfuscation score is high (~0.7), justified by variable naming. The overall security risk is very low (~0.2), given the absence of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, complex evaluation tool for speech/text error analysis with no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. Its obfuscation is likely stylistic rather than malicious. The security risk is minimal, and the dependency can be considered safe for use.",
