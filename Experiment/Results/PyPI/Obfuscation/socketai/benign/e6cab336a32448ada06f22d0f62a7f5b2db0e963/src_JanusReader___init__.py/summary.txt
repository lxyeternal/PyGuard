  "conclusion": "The code snippets exhibit obfuscation and unconventional import patterns that warrant caution but do not confirm malicious activity. The current scores are appropriate, with low malware likelihood and high suspicion due to obfuscation. Additional analysis of the imported functions is necessary to determine if malicious behavior exists. Until then, the code should be treated as suspicious but not malicious."
