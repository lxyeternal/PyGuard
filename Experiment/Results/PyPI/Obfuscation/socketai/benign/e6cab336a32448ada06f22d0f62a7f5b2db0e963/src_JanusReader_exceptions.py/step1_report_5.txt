  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class named XXBpdeZCUzIeSXGtlqXzqjhaXRHAqyow",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in this code",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present in this code",
  "flows": "No data flow, as this is a class definition without operational logic",
  "anomalies": "Class name appears obfuscated, but this alone does not indicate malicious intent; no other unusual code or hardcoded secrets are present",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward class declaration inheriting from Exception, likely intended as a custom exception. The class name appears intentionally obfuscated, but no malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. There are no input/output operations, network interactions, or code execution flows that could indicate malicious activity. The code is minimal and appears to serve a standard purpose within a larger project.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, non-malicious class definition with an obfuscated name. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks in this snippet.",
