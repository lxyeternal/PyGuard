  "sources": "No data input sources are present in this code",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in this code",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs within this code",
  "anomalies": "The class name appears obfuscated or intentionally nonsensical, which could be a red flag for obfuscation or malicious intent. However, the code itself is straightforward and merely defines a class.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single custom exception class with an obfuscated name that inherits from Python's built-in Exception class. There are no data inputs, outputs, or other logic present. The obfuscated class name may suggest an attempt to hide intent, but in isolation, it only shows an unusual naming choice. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple class definition for a custom exception with an obfuscated name. There is no malicious behavior or security risk evident in this fragment alone, though the naming may be intended to obscure intent. It appears benign in isolation.",
