  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class named XXBpdeZCUzIeSXGtlqXzqjhaXRHAqyow",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; class declaration does not read external data",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; simply defines a class",
  "anomalies": "Class name appears obfuscated or randomly generated; no meaningful identifier or documentation",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a class declaration that inherits from Exception, with no additional logic, data handling, or external interactions. The class name appears random or obfuscated, which could be an attempt to hide intent, but on its own, it does not perform any malicious actions or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple custom exception class with an obfuscated name. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or unusual code constructs. The obfuscation could be benign or suspicious, but there is no evidence of malicious intent within this snippet.",
