  "purpose": "Custom exception class definition, likely for error handling in a larger application.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; class definition does not read external data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs; class does not perform any operations or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow; class only defines a custom exception.",
  "anomalies": "Class name appears obfuscated or nonsensical, possibly indicative of code obfuscation or concealment. No other unusual code features present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single custom exception class with a deliberately obscure name. It contains no methods, no data processing, and no external interactions. The naming pattern does not suggest any malicious behavior; it might be an attempt to hide purpose or simply obfuscate. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious logic. Overall, the code is minimal and standard in structure, aside from the obfuscated class name.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a basic custom exception class with an unusual name. There are no signs of malicious activity or security risks within this snippet. The obfuscated class name could suggest code concealment but does not inherently indicate malicious intent.",
