  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class with an obfuscated name, potentially used for concealment or generated code.",
  "sources": "Class declaration; no data input/output, network calls, or external interactions.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data flows or external effects.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data or control flow beyond class definition.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class name 'XXBpdeZCUzIeSXGtlqXzqjhaXRHAqyow' suggests potential concealment or generated code, but no malicious behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward class inheriting from Exception with no logic or external interactions. The obfuscated name is suspicious but not malicious in isolation. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code, noting the obfuscation as a red flag but without evidence of malicious intent. Malware scores are appropriately zero; obfuscation scores are high (~0.7), reflecting suspicion; security risk scores are low (~0.1-0.2). The scores are consistent with the code's benign structure. Obfuscation alone does not imply malicious activity, but caution is warranted in broader contexts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal class definition with an obfuscated name. There is no evidence of malware or malicious behavior. The obfuscation warrants some caution but does not justify high security risks. Overall, the code appears safe in isolation, though obfuscation should be monitored in larger codebases.",
