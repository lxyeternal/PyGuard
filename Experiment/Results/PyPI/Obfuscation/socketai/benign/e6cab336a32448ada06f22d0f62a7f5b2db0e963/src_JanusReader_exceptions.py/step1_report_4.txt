  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not handle or output untrusted data",
  "flows": "None; no data flow present",
  "anomalies": "Class name appears to be a randomized or obfuscated string, which could be suspicious; no other unusual code behaviors observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single custom exception class with a highly obfuscated name, likely generated or intentionally obscure. There are no data inputs, no functions, no network calls, or other behavior. The class itself is harmless and standard in syntax, but the obfuscated naming warrants caution as it may be used to hide malicious intent or evade detection.",
  "conclusion": "The code by itself appears to be a simple, harmless custom exception class, but the obfuscated name could be used to conceal malicious behavior in a larger context. No malicious activity or malicious code is directly evident.",
