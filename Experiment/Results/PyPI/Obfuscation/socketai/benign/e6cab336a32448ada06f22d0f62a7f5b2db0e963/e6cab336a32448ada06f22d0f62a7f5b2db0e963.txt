      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal class definition with an obfuscated name. There is no evidence of malware or malicious behavior. The obfuscation warrants some caution but does not justify high security risks. Overall, the code appears safe in isolation, though obfuscation should be monitored in larger codebases."

      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code snippets exhibit obfuscation and unconventional import patterns that warrant caution but do not confirm malicious activity. The current scores are appropriate, with low malware likelihood and high suspicion due to obfuscation. Additional analysis of the imported functions is necessary to determine if malicious behavior exists. Until then, the code should be treated as suspicious but not malicious."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a complex, obfuscated parser that appears benign. Despite high obfuscation, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The current low malware score is appropriate, and the high obfuscation score reflects variable naming. Overall, the code poses minimal security risk based on this fragment."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate scientific data parser with obfuscation artifacts. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks based on static analysis. The obfuscation may be intentional concealment or domain-specific naming, but it does not constitute malicious activity."
