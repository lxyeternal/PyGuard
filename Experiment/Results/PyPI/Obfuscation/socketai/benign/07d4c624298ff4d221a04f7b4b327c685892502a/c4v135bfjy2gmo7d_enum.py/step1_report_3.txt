  "purpose": "Define an enumeration representing various manga demographics and related metadata for the MangaDex API.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the enum class definition and associated docstrings; no external data sources or inputs are used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present; the code only defines an enum class.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input to critical functions; the enum is static.",
  "anomalies": "Extensive docstrings with repetitive and verbose text; no malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. No dynamic execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python enum class with extensive descriptive comments. It contains no code execution, no external data handling, and no suspicious patterns. The long docstrings are informational and do not involve any dynamic or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, static enumeration class used for representing manga demographics and metadata. There are no signs of malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks.",
