  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The code is a class definition with extensive documentation, no executable logic, no data handling.\n- **Errors or Flaws?** The report notes verbose, auto-generated documentation, which is unusual but not malicious. No logical errors identified.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score is 0, which aligns with the benign nature. Security risk is low (0.1), given the lack of executable code.\n- **Overall:** Correct assessment. No changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The class is a static enum with detailed docstrings, no runtime issues.\n- **Errors or Flaws?** Similar to Report 1, verbose documentation is unusual but not malicious.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score is 0, consistent with the code's static nature.\n- **Overall:** Accurate. No adjustments necessary.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. Same pattern—enum class with verbose documentation.\n- **Errors or Flaws?** No, no malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score remains 0.\n- **Overall:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. Extensive documentation, no executable code.\n- **Errors or Flaws?** No issues detected.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score is 0.\n- **Overall:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. Similar pattern.\n- **Errors or Flaws?** No.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score is 0.\n- **Overall:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a static, documentation-heavy Enum class with no malicious or obfuscated content.\n- The malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate.\n- The security risk scores are very low, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports; no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0; no obfuscation present.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 is reasonable, but given the absence of executable code, a risk score of 0.1 is acceptable.\n\n**Overall, the reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications are necessary.**",
