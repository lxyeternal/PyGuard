  "purpose": "Setup script for the Python package 'asyncdex', reading version info and README, then configuring package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from '../asyncdex/version.py' and README from '../README.rst'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; static data used in setup().",
  "flows": "Reads version string, processes it, and passes static parameters to setup().",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; fragile version parsing by splitting on '=' and converting to float; no validation of version format.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script with obfuscated variable names, which do not indicate malicious intent. It reads version info from a file and converts it to float, which can be fragile if the version format is complex (e.g., '1.0.0'). No network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration is present. The variable obfuscation appears stylistic rather than malicious. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are detected. The malware score is correctly 0, as no malicious behavior is evident. The obfuscation score could be moderately high due to variable naming but is not malicious. The security risk score is low, reflecting the benign nature of the script. The fragile version parsing is a minor maintainability concern but not a security issue.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with obfuscated variable names and a fragile version parsing method. No malicious activity or security vulnerabilities are detected. The obfuscation is superficial and does not imply malicious intent. The scores should reflect no malware (0), moderate obfuscation (~0.7), and low security risk (~0.2).",
