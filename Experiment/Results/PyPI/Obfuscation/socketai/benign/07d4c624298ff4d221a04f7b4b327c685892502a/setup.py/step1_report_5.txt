{
  "purpose": "The code is setting up a Python package using setuptools, reading version information and README content for package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading version.py for version info, reading README.rst for long description, hardcoded setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "None identified—no untrusted data outputs or external communications.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file reads (version and README) into setup configuration, which is standard.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are obfuscated or randomly generated, but this alone is not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code flows detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, reads version info from a file, reads README content, and calls setup() with package metadata and dependencies. Variable names are obfuscated but do not impact functionality or security. No network calls, no eval or exec, no data leaks, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard setup configuration for a Python package with obfuscated variable names, which does not indicate malicious intent. No malware or security risks detected.",
