{
  "purpose": "Defines multiple data classes with optional fields related to order directions, likely for use in sorting or filtering operations.",
  "sources": "Imports from dataclasses, typing, and a local enum module; data class attribute assignments.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no data is processed or transmitted to external sources.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; code mainly establishes data structures.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated-looking class names and variable names; no hardcoded credentials or secrets observed; no suspicious code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of several data classes with fields for order directions, which appear to be for sorting or filtering. The class and variable names are intentionally obfuscated, but the structure suggests standard data organization without any external input handling or malicious logic. No network activity, file operations, or environment variable usage are present. The import statements and code structure do not show signs of malicious behavior. There are no backdoors, data exfiltration, or system manipulation code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of data class definitions with obfuscated identifiers, serving likely as data models. There are no malicious behaviors, security risks, or malicious intent detected. The code appears benign and purely structural.",
