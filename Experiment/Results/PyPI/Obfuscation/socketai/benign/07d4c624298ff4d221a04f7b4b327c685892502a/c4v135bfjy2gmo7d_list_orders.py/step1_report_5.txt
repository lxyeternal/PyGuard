  "purpose": "Define multiple immutable data classes representing different entities with optional OrderDirection fields, and a dictionary for mapping string keys to other string values.",
  "sources": "Imports from dataclasses, typing, and a relative import from .enum. The _known_order_mappings dictionary. Class definitions and their attributes.",
  "sinks": "No clear sink points for untrusted data or external outputs. No functions or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines static data structures and a dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "Class and variable names are obfuscated or nonsensical, which may indicate code hiding or obfuscation. The code appears to be designed to obscure its intent, though no malicious activity such as network communication, file manipulation, or code execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of data class definitions with optional fields of type 'OrderDirection'. The _known_order_mappings dictionary maps string keys to string values, possibly for internal use or renaming conventions. The class and variable names are intentionally obscure, which could suggest obfuscation. There are no functions, no input/output handling, and no suspicious or malicious commands. The structure appears to be for data modeling, possibly part of a larger application, with no evidence of malicious behavior or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is mainly static data class and dictionary definitions with obfuscated names, likely for internal data modeling. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The obfuscation of names might be suspicious but does not by itself indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code seems benign but somewhat intentionally obscured.",
