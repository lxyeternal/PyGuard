{
  "purpose": "Define data structures with optional ordering directions for various entities, possibly for sorting or querying.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'dataclasses', 'typing', and a relative import of 'OrderDirection' from '.enum'. No external input reading present.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; the code does not perform data output, network operations, or file handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; the code primarily defines immutable data classes.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated class names and variable names; no actual logic or data manipulation present. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code only declares multiple frozen data classes with optional fields, each potentially representing different entities with various attributes related to order directions. The presence of an imported enum suggests these classes are used for structured data handling, likely in sorting or querying contexts. There are no functions, no data processing, and no network or file operations. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The obfuscated naming appears to be intentional but does not indicate malicious intent; it likely aims to obscure the purpose of the classes.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely consists of data class definitions with no operations, data flow, or external interactions. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet.",
