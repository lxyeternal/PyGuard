{
  "purpose": "Define multiple immutable data classes with optional OrderDirection fields, likely serving as internal data models or schemas.",
  "sources": "Static dictionary '_known_order_mappings' and class attribute definitions; no external data input or data flow detected.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks, data leaks, or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only declares data structures without processing or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names; no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, no malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of data class definitions with obfuscated names and a static dictionary. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, network activity, or data exfiltration. The obfuscation appears intentional but benign, serving as internal data models. No data flow from untrusted sources or external interactions is present. The malware score is appropriately zero, and the low security risk scores reflect the benign nature. The high obfuscation scores are justified but do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as internal data schemas with obfuscated identifiers. No malicious activity or security risks are detected. The obfuscation warrants cautious review if part of a larger system, but based solely on this snippet, it is safe.",
