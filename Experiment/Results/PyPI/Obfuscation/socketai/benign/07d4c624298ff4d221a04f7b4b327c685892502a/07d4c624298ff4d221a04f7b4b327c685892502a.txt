There is no evidence of malicious behavior or external data leaks. The obfuscation should be noted for further review but does not currently indicate malicious intent. The overall security risk is low."

The malware score should remain at 0, obfuscation is high (~0.75), and overall risk is low (~0.2). Continuous monitoring is recommended, but based on static analysis, the supply chain risk appears minimal."

Obfuscation is superficial and not indicative of sabotage. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score remains at 0.0. The obfuscation score is modest (~0.2-0.3), reflecting superficial obfuscation. The risk score is approximately 0.2, consistent with a standard API client with typical security considerations."
