  "conclusion": "The code is utility and data modeling infrastructure with high obfuscation but no signs of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The malware score should remain at 0, obfuscation is high (~0.75), and overall risk is low (~0.2). Continuous monitoring is recommended, but based on static analysis, the supply chain risk appears minimal."
