  "sinks": "Attribute assignments, data class representations, dynamic attribute setting, data collection modifications.",
  "flows": "Source data (dicts, strings) -> attribute setting or data class instantiation -> potential data access or representation.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and class names, use of sentinel objects, dynamic attribute setting, complex data flow without documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises utility classes and functions for data handling, with heavily obfuscated identifiers and dynamic attribute manipulation. No network, file, or system commands are present. The obfuscation and dynamic behaviors could be used to hide malicious intent, but no evidence of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, network calls, or system modifications is observed. The code appears to serve as a data modeling or ORM-like framework, with complex but benign logic. The high obfuscation scores are justified, but malware indicators are absent. The overall security risk is low, with potential concerns mainly around obfuscation rather than malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is utility and data modeling infrastructure with high obfuscation but no signs of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The malware score should remain at 0, obfuscation is high (~0.75), and overall risk is low (~0.2). Continuous monitoring is recommended, but based on static analysis, the supply chain risk appears minimal.",
