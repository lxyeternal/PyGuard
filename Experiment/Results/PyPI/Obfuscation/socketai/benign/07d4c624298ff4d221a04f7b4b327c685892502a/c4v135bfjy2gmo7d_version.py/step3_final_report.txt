  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code patterns, data flows, and anomalies.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user inputs, module imports, environment data, and external parameters.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls, network connections, file operations, environment variable access, and system commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources like environment variables or user input to sinks such as subprocess or network functions, potentially leading to injection or data leakage.",
  "anomalies": "Potential unvalidated subprocess inputs, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, and incomplete code snippets with limited suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code appears benign across all reports, with no evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation. Report 2 highlights unvalidated subprocess inputs, which pose a security concern but do not constitute malware. Confidence levels are appropriate, and scores are consistent with the analysis. The overall security posture is low risk, with a slight elevation (0.3-0.5) due to input validation concerns. No evidence suggests active malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency is largely benign with no malware detected. The primary concern is unvalidated inputs in subprocess calls, which warrants attention but does not elevate the overall risk to high. Scores are justified and consistent with the detailed assessments.",
