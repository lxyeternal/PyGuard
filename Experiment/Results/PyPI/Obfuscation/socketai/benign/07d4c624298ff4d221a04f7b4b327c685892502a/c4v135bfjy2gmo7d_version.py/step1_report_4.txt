  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a basic Python script intended for general execution, potentially for data processing or utility functions, but the specific purpose cannot be determined definitively from the provided snippet.",
  "sources": "Input data may be read from the console (e.g., input()), environment variables (via os.environ), or external files if such code exists in the full script. In the provided fragment, no explicit data sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections (e.g., socket or requests library usage), file operations (write or append), or executing dynamic code (exec, eval). No explicit sink functions are shown in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "Without concrete code, no explicit source-to-sink data flows can be established. If present in the full code, flows might include reading input or environment variables and then using that data in network requests or system commands.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns are visible in the provided snippet. The code appears straightforward and typical.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet is empty or incomplete, preventing detailed analysis. Based on the absence of suspicious constructs, no malicious behavior can be inferred. The structure does not show signs of obfuscation, malicious data handling, or backdoors. However, the lack of complete code limits a thorough assessment.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code fragment, there are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears benign, but the assessment is limited due to the incomplete snippet.",
