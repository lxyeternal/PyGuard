{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python module performing data processing and utility functions, with no immediately obvious malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Data sources include input functions, environment variables, or external file reads if present in the code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or system commands executed with untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks through various functions or processing steps, which need to be checked for unsanitized handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscated code, or backdoors are observed. No unusual behaviors such as network communication or system modification are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of standard data processing routines. There are no indications of malicious code like data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful system modifications. Usage of third-party libraries appears normal. No suspicious flow or anomalies in code structure. Without any hidden or obfuscated code, the likelihood of malicious intent is low. The absence of network activity or system alteration points to a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or significant security risks. The code seems to be a typical utility module with no evidence of security concerns.",
