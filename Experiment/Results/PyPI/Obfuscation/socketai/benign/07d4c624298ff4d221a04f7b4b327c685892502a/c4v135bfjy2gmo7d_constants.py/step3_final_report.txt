  "purpose": "Regex pattern to validate filenames and folder names against invalid characters and reserved system names across Windows, MacOS, and Linux.",
  "sources": "Compilation of regex pattern matching control characters, special characters, and reserved device names.",
  "sinks": "Used in filename or folder name validation functions before filesystem operations.",
  "flows": "Input filename/folder name string -> regex match -> validation decision.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of import from '.ratelimit' with obfuscated class names; regex pattern itself is standard and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a comprehensive regex to prevent invalid filenames, including control characters and reserved names. The import from a local module 'ratelimit' with complex class names appears unrelated to the validation logic. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious activity is evident. The regex is straightforward, and the import may be benign or for rate limiting elsewhere. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign purpose of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate filename validation utility with no evidence of malicious intent. The only minor concern is the import from an obscure module, which warrants further review but does not indicate malicious behavior. Overall, the supply chain risk is minimal.",
