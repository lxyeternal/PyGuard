  "purpose": "Define a regular expression pattern to validate or filter filenames or folder names against invalid characters and reserved names in Windows, MacOS, and Linux.",
  "sources": "The re.compile() function creates a regex pattern object used for matching strings against invalid filename rules.",
  "sinks": "Potential use in filename validation functions to prevent creation of files or directories with invalid names.",
  "flows": "Input string (filename/folder name) -> regex match check -> validation decision or rejection.",
  "anomalies": "The code imports modules and defines a regex for filename validation, which is standard; no anomalies or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 're' and 'compile' from 're', then defines a regex pattern that matches invalid filename characters and reserved names. The pattern is comprehensive, including control characters and Windows reserved names. The pattern is well-documented with explanations and references, with no code execution or external network calls. No obfuscated or malicious behaviors are present. The purpose appears solely to validate filename safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate filename validation pattern intended to prevent invalid or reserved filenames. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
