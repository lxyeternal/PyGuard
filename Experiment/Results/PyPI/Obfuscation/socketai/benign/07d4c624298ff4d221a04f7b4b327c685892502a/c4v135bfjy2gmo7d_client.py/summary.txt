  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured open-source API client for MangaDex. No malicious behavior or payloads are detected. Obfuscation is superficial and not indicative of sabotage. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score remains at 0.0. The obfuscation score is modest (~0.2-0.3), reflecting superficial obfuscation. The risk score is approximately 0.2, consistent with a standard API client with typical security considerations."
