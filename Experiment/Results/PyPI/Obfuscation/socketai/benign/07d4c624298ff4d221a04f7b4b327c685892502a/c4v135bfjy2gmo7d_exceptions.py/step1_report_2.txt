{
  "purpose": "This code defines several custom exception classes for handling various HTTP and application-specific errors, mainly related to authorization, missing attributes, and captcha challenges.",
  "sources": "The code reads class instantiation parameters, including response objects, attributes, and identifiers.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks that handle untrusted data; the code mainly constructs exception messages and stores parameters.",
  "flows": "Input parameters such as response objects and attribute values flow into exception messages and object attributes, but there is no evident flow from untrusted sources to insecure sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The variable names are obfuscated, e.g., ckOCWcJONNRSEhFjMcQBUmkUYDGxBbRp, which indicates potential code obfuscation. No hardcoded credentials or malicious payloads are evident. Exception messages are dynamically generated but do not reveal sensitive data. No network calls or malicious behaviors are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for exceptions, primarily involving string formatting for error messages. The obfuscated variable names suggest code obfuscation, but this is common in protecting source code or in third-party packages. No input handling, data processing, or network operations are present. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or hidden payloads. The code appears to be a standard implementation of custom exceptions with obfuscated variable names.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of custom exception class definitions with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. The obfuscation might be for code protection, but it does not indicate malicious behavior. Overall, the code is benign.",
