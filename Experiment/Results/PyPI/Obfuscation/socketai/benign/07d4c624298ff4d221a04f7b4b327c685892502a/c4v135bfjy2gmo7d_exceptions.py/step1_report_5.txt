  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific API errors in an asynchronous HTTP client context.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to exception class constructors, such as response objects, attribute values, permission strings, and request details.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data passed to exception messages, especially string formatting with input parameters like permission, attribute, or captcha info.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into exception message strings, which are then used in raising exceptions; no external data flows or network calls are explicitly shown.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names (e.g., ckOCWcJONNRSEhFjMcQBUmkUYDGxBbRp), which could indicate attempts to conceal intent. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code is visible.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple custom exception classes inheriting from HTTPException or AsyncDexException, mainly for handling authorization, permission, captcha, and resource errors. All data used in messages are passed as parameters; no external data sources or network interactions are evident. Variable names are intentionally obfuscated, which could be suspicious but does not by itself indicate malicious behavior. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious actions are apparent within this code fragment. The code seems to be structured error handling for an API client.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to define standard exception classes for API error handling with obfuscated variable names, possibly to hide details or deter casual inspection. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this fragment. The overall security risk is low.",
