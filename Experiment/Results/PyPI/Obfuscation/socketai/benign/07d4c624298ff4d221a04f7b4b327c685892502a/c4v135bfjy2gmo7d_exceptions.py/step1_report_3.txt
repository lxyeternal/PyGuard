{
  "purpose": "The code defines several custom exception classes for handling various HTTP and application errors, likely within an asynchronous Python application or library.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function parameters such as strings, optional dictionaries, and aiohttp.ClientResponse objects, mostly during exception instantiation.",
  "sinks": "The code constructs exception messages using input parameters, but does not directly write data to external sources or perform network actions within this fragment.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., response objects, string identifiers) are used to generate exception messages; these are internal flows and do not involve untrusted data affecting system behavior beyond message construction.",
  "anomalies": "The variable names are obfuscated (e.g., ckOCWcJONNRSEhFjMcQBUmkUYDGxBbRp, GnFadYutIMOBejHrHnjaGWToqSuTxYng), which may hinder understanding but does not indicate malicious intent by itself. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are present. No use of insecure functions or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines exception classes that extend from standard HTTP exceptions, with message formatting involving input parameters. The obfuscated variable names are unusual but do not inherently indicate malicious activity. There are no data leaks, network connections, or malicious payloads. The code appears to be part of a larger, well-structured application, focusing solely on error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists of well-structured exception class definitions with obfuscated variable names. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. It is likely part of a larger application for API error management. The obfuscation may raise some concern but appears to be an attempt at code obscurity rather than malicious activity.",
