{
  "purpose": "The code defines several custom exception classes used in an asynchronous HTTP client context, primarily for handling authorization, permission, captcha, and resource-related errors.",
  "sources": "Data is read from function parameters such as 'attribute', 'permission', 'id', 'model', 'response', and various string literals used in exception messages.",
  "sinks": "Exception messages are constructed using input parameters; however, no untrusted data is directly executed, evaluated, or transmitted over networks within this code.",
  "flows": "Input parameters like 'attribute', 'permission', 'id', 'model', and 'response' are used to create exception messages, which are then raised. There are no data flows that lead untrusted data to dangerous sinks such as system commands or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code are present. The code appears to be standard exception class definitions with dynamic message formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple custom exception classes inheriting from standard HTTP or asynchronous exceptions, with constructors that format messages based on provided parameters. No execution of untrusted code, network communication, or data leakage mechanisms are observed. The use of f-strings and parameter insertion appears safe. There is no indication of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical set of exception class definitions for handling HTTP and authorization errors in an async context. It does not contain malware, malicious behaviors, or security risks. It is safe and straightforward.",
