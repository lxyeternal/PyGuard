{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling various API and HTTP errors, primarily for use in an asynchronous API client or SDK.",
  "sources": "Parameters passed into exception constructors such as response objects, attribute names, permission strings, IDs, and response data.",
  "sinks": "Exception messages constructed from input parameters; no data is transmitted or executed; no untrusted data flows into system vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into exception messages and class attributes; no malicious or insecure data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of variable names (e.g., ckOCWcJONNRSEhFjMcQBUmkUYDGxBbRp), suggesting code obfuscation or automated code generation; no malicious payloads or secrets evident.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, with dynamic message formatting based on input parameters. The obfuscated variable names are consistent across multiple classes, indicating intentional obfuscation, possibly for source protection. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code execution is present. The exception messages are safely constructed, and no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are detected. The high obfuscation scores are justified, but malware scores remain at zero due to the absence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as error handling classes within an API client framework. The obfuscation is likely for code concealment or protection, not malicious activity. No security risks or malware are present based on this fragment.",
