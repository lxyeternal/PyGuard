  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code snippets and the details provided.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to HTTP and API error handling.\n- The variable names are heavily obfuscated (e.g., ckOCWcJONNRSEhFjMcQBUmkUYDGxBbRp, TqhXOjTyvCaJGiwfDsoyuilNohSluckn), which suggests intentional obfuscation or automated code generation.\n- No actual data processing, network calls, or execution of untrusted code are present within these snippets.\n- Exception messages are dynamically constructed with input parameters, but no sensitive data appears to be leaked or mishandled.\n- No hardcoded secrets, malicious payloads, or suspicious code patterns are evident.\n- The obfuscation may be for code protection or to hinder easy understanding, but it does not inherently indicate malicious intent.\n\nNow, let's review each report in detail:\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n**Purpose:** Defines several custom exception classes for handling API errors.\n\n**Analysis:** The code is primarily class definitions with dynamic message formatting. Obfuscated variable names raise suspicion but do not indicate malicious activity. No data leaks or malicious behaviors are evident.\n\n**Risk and malware scores:**  \n- *Malware:* 0 (no malicious behavior)  \n- *Security risk:* 0.2 (low, mainly due to obfuscation)  \n- *Obfuscated:* 0.8 (high obfuscation)  \n- *Confidence:* 0.7\n\n**Verdict:** The code appears benign, with obfuscation being the main concern.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n**Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, defining exception classes with obfuscated variable names.\n\n**Analysis:** Same as above. No malicious activity detected. Obfuscation is present but seems to serve code concealment rather than malicious intent.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- *Malware:* 0  \n- *Security risk:* 0.2  \n- *Obfuscated:* 0.8  \n- *Confidence:* 0.8\n\n**Verdict:** Benign, standard exception classes with obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n**Purpose:** Again, exception classes for API error handling.\n\n**Analysis:** Consistent with previous reports. Obfuscated variable names but no signs of malicious behavior. No network activity or data exfiltration evident.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- *Malware:* 0  \n- *Security risk:* 0.1 (very low)  \n- *Obfuscated:* 0.7  \n- *Confidence:* 0.8\n\n**Verdict:** No malicious activity, likely part of a larger framework or SDK.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n**Purpose:** Exception classes for authorization, permission, captcha, and resource errors.\n\n**Analysis:** Same pattern. Obfuscated variable names, but no malicious code or suspicious behavior. Exception messages are constructed safely.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- *Malware:* 0  \n- *Security risk:* 0.1  \n- *Obfuscated:* 0  \n- *Confidence:* 0.9\n\n**Verdict:** Safe, standard error handling code.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n**Purpose:** Defines exception classes for API errors, with obfuscated variable names.\n\n**Analysis:** Consistent with previous assessments. No evidence of malicious behavior. Obfuscation might be to hide implementation details.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- *Malware:* 0  \n- *Security risk:* 0.2  \n- *Obfuscated:* 0.7  \n- *Confidence:* 0.8\n\n**Verdict:** No security concerns; code appears to be standard exception handling with obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the analysis. No evidence of malicious payloads, code execution, or network exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscated variable names:** Consistent across reports, suggesting code obfuscation but not necessarily malicious.\n- **Security risk:** Very low across all reports, mostly due to obfuscation rather than actual vulnerabilities.\n- **Functionality:** The code is purely for error handling, with no direct data leaks, malicious activity, or insecure operations.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- The obfuscation is the main concern, potentially hindering maintenance or understanding but does not imply malicious intent.\n- The malware score should remain at **0**.\n- The obfuscated score can stay high (around 0.7-0.8), reflecting the obfuscation.\n- The overall security risk remains low, given the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0.8** (consistent with code obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** (low, mainly due to obfuscation)\n\n**Summary:** The code appears to be standard exception class definitions, likely auto-generated or intentionally obfuscated for code protection. No security or malware concerns are evident from this fragment.",
