  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing the findings with the provided code snippets.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies that these are custom exception classes for API error handling, with data coming from parameters like response objects and strings.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No direct data leaks or execution of untrusted data; parameters flow into exception messages.\n- **Anomalies:** Obfuscated variable names (e.g., ckOCWcJONNRSEhFjMcQBUmkUYDGxBbRp) are noted, suggesting obfuscation or automated code generation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The obfuscation is suspicious but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware score is 0, which aligns with the analysis. Security risk is low (0.2). Confidence is 0.7, which seems reasonable given the obfuscation concern.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is consistent. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes these are exception classes, with parameters like response objects and IDs.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No evidence of untrusted data being executed or transmitted insecurely.\n- **Anomalies:** Obfuscated variable names again, but no malicious payloads or secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious intent; code appears to be standard exception definitions with obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware score is 0, matching the conclusion. Security risk is low (0.2). Confidence at 0.8 seems appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; the report's reasoning and scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern—exception classes for HTTP errors, with parameters used for message formatting.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No network or data leaks; parameters are used internally.\n- **Anomalies:** Obfuscated variable names, but no malicious activity.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is benign, with obfuscation possibly for code protection.\n- **Scores:** Malware score is 0, consistent with the analysis. Security risk is low (0.1). Confidence at 0.8 is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate assessment; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Exception classes for API errors, with parameters like 'attribute', 'permission', etc.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data executed or transmitted; only used in exception messages.\n- **Anomalies:** Obfuscated variable names, but no malicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior; standard error handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware score 0, matching the conclusion. Security risk is low (0.1). Confidence 0.9 is high but justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Correctly assessed; no modifications needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar pattern—exception classes with parameters.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data flows or malicious actions.\n- **Anomalies:** Obfuscated variable names, but no evidence of malicious intent.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malware or malicious activity; code appears to be standard exception definitions.\n- **Scores:** Malware score 0, consistent with findings. Security risk low (0.2). Confidence 0.8.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- All reports correctly identify that these are exception class definitions, with obfuscated variable names but no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- Security risk scores are low, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n- Confidence levels are high, given the consistent pattern across reports.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Estimated malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** 0.8 (variable names are obfuscated)  \n**Estimated security risk score:** 0.2 (minimal, mainly due to obfuscation, but no actual vulnerabilities)\n\nThis analysis confirms that the code is primarily a set of custom exception classes with obfuscated variable names, likely for code protection or generated code, but with no evidence of malware or malicious intent.",
