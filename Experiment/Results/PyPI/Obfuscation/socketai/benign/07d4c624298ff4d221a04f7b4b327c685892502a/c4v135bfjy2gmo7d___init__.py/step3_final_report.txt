{
  "purpose": "This code primarily consists of import statements from internal modules, with no executable logic, network calls, or data processing visible. The purpose appears to be module aggregation or setup within a larger package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules, including client, enum, exceptions, list_orders, models, utils, and version modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths are observable in this snippet; it only imports components.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated or nonsensical identifiers such as NyNheUsRPilaMfrvGruHrmCBlGBLMPDp and txAmUYRGNrthcgakJyCogtgWeBOBSXch, which could suggest obfuscation or internal naming conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only import statements, with no executable logic or external interactions. The obfuscated identifiers are suspicious but could be benign internal or auto-generated names. Malware and malicious activity are not evident. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not confirm malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports—malware score of 0, obfuscation around 0.6-0.7, and low security risk (~0.2)—are consistent with the evidence. Further review of the actual implementation files is recommended to ensure no hidden malicious logic exists.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, consisting solely of import statements with obfuscated identifiers that may be internal or auto-generated. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or external data leaks. The obfuscation should be noted for further review but does not currently indicate malicious intent. The overall security risk is low.",
