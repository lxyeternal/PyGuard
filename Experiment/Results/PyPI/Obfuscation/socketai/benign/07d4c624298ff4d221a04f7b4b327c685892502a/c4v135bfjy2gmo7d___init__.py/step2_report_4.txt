  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, obfuscation, and overall security implications.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues Present?** No executable code, only import statements. No data flows or sinks are visible.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** The report correctly notes obfuscated identifiers but rightly concludes no malicious behavior can be inferred.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0.6, Risk = 0.2. These seem reasonable given the obfuscation but lack of malicious activity.\n- **Justification for scores:** Obfuscated names are suspicious but not definitive. No evidence of malware.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriately cautious but no immediate threat.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, only import statements with obfuscated names.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0.6, Risk = 0.2. Consistent with the analysis.\n- **Comments:** No signs of malicious activity; obfuscation alone isn't enough.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Again, only import statements with obfuscated identifiers.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0.7, Risk = 0.2. Slightly higher obfuscation score but still no direct evidence.\n- **Comments:** No malicious activity detected.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same pattern: import statements, obfuscated names.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0.7, Risk = 0.2.\n- **Comments:** No evidence of malicious behavior.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar again, mainly import statements with some unusual naming.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0.3, Risk = 0.2.\n- **Comments:** Low obfuscation score, consistent with benign code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign a 0, as there's no evidence of malicious activity in these import statements.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** High across reports, indicating suspicion due to naming conventions. However, obfuscation alone isn't malicious.\n- **Risk Score:** Low (0.2), appropriate given the lack of actual malicious behavior.\n\n### My Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0.0 — no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.6 — the naming conventions are suspicious but not definitive.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — low, based on current evidence.\n\n**Final note:** The import statements alone are not dangerous, but the obfuscated identifiers warrant further review of the actual implementation code to ensure no malicious logic exists hidden elsewhere.",
