      "conclusion": "The code is an obfuscated argument parsing utility with no direct evidence of malicious activity. Its high obfuscation level raises suspicion, but without concrete malicious signals, it should be considered potentially risky but not definitively malicious. Further manual review is recommended before deployment in supply chain contexts."
