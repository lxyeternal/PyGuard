{
  "purpose": "Define a class that inherits from another class and provides methods to access user and customer data, likely within a larger application context.",
  "sources": "Imports from tb_wrapper.handle_exception and tb_wrapper.MainController; class methods accessing user and customer data.",
  "sinks": "Methods returning user IDs and customer data, but no direct sinks for untrusted input or sensitive data transmission are evident.",
  "flows": "Class instantiation → method calls like get_user() and get_customer_users() → data returned or used.",
  "anomalies": "Class name and method names are obfuscated; the class is decorated with an obscure decorator; no explicit hardcoded secrets, but the obfuscation could be suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules that might handle exceptions and main controller logic. The class inherits from a superclass, implying it extends functionality. Methods primarily call functions on self.ONuxQrymzlSatBsnukSKSRzcwymVMAlh, which seems to be an object related to user management. The class is heavily obfuscated with random names, making static analysis difficult. There are no apparent hardcoded credentials, network calls, or data leaks. The obfuscation and lack of clear intent could suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent, but no direct malicious actions are visible within this code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be obfuscated but functionally standard for a class managing user data. There are no explicit signs of malicious behavior or malware. The obfuscation may be suspicious, but without evidence of harmful actions, it is likely benign. Overall, no immediate security threats are identified from this snippet.",
