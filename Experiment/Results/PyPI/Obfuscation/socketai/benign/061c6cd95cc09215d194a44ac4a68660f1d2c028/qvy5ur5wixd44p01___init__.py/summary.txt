  "security_risk": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0.7,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The reports are consistent with their scoring. Report 3 warrants high suspicion, justified by obfuscation and dynamic execution. Other reports show no malicious activity, with scores appropriately low. Minor adjustments could be made to confidence levels in benign reports, but overall, the assessments are accurate."
