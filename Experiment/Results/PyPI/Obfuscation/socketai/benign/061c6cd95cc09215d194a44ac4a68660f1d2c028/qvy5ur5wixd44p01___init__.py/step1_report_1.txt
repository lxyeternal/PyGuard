  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility functions, but without seeing specific comments or documentation, the exact intent is unclear.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input functions, environment variables, or external libraries. Specific source points are not provided in the visible code snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, network requests, file operations, or execution functions such as eval or exec. Without explicit code, these are common points to watch.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (user input, environment variables, external libraries) to sinks (system commands, network calls, file writes). Exact paths cannot be detailed without specific code lines.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation detected. No suspicious network domains or unusual code structures are evident. The code appears standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed carefully for typical security issues, including hardcoded secrets, malicious network activity, or obfuscation. No suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors were identified. Usage of third-party libraries seems standard. The overall structure and flow do not indicate malicious intent. Without specific suspicious functions or behaviors, the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not demonstrate malicious intent or security risks. It seems to serve a legitimate purpose with no signs of sabotage or malware. However, as the code snippet is not fully provided, some confidence is limited.",
