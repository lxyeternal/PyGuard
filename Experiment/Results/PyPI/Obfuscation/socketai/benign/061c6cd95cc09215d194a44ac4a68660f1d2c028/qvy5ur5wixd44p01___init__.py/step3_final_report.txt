  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Use of environment variables, dynamic code execution (eval, exec), hardcoded URLs/strings, input reading functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks via environment variables, network connections, or file operations; dynamic code execution paths.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or input functions flow into eval/exec or network functions, possibly leading to malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated code, use of eval/exec, hardcoded URLs/strings, conditional logic that could hide malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits suspicious patterns including dynamic execution and obfuscation, indicating potential malicious intent. Benign code lacks such patterns. The scores reflect these observations, with high malware (0.75), obfuscation (0.7), and risk (0.8) for suspicious code, and low scores for benign snippets. Confidence levels are appropriate given the evidence. No false positives are evident, and the evaluation aligns with the described behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The reports are consistent with their scoring. Report 3 warrants high suspicion, justified by obfuscation and dynamic execution. Other reports show no malicious activity, with scores appropriately low. Minor adjustments could be made to confidence levels in benign reports, but overall, the assessments are accurate.",
