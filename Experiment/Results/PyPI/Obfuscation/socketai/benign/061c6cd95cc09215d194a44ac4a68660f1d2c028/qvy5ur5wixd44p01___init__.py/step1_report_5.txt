  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or communication, but without the actual code content, the specific intent cannot be confirmed.",
  "sources": "Input data may come from function parameters, environment variables, or external files/readers if present in the code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or execution functions if present in the code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources through processing functions to sinks, potentially untrusted data could reach sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No specific anomalies are identifiable without code content. Watch for hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious external calls.",
  "analysis": "Insufficient code provided for detailed analysis. The review process involves identifying data sources, sinks, and data flow, then detecting anomalies like hardcoded secrets or malicious code segments. As no code is supplied, a detailed step-by-step review cannot be performed.",
  "conclusion": "Unable to determine malicious intent or security risks due to lack of code. The code review process relies on inspecting the actual source code to identify suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors.",
