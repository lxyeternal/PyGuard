  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for constructing entity data queries, possibly part of an SDK or internal API. Obfuscation is present and warrants caution, but there is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data theft, network exfiltration, or system sabotage. The low malware score and moderate risk score are appropriate. Continuous monitoring and broader context review are recommended to ensure it is not part of a malicious payload."
