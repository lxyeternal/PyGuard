  "conclusion": "The analyzed code functions as a standard client SDK for Thingsboard with obfuscated identifiers. No evidence of malicious activity or sabotage is detected. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not justify high malware or risk scores. The overall security posture is low risk, with moderate concern due to obfuscation and credential handling practices."
