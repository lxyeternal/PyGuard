  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated and depends on external modules whose behavior is unknown. There is no evidence of malicious activity within this snippet, but the obfuscation and handling of sensitive data pose potential risks. The malware score is low, but the overall security risk warrants further review of external dependencies. The scores are consistent with the observed code characteristics."
