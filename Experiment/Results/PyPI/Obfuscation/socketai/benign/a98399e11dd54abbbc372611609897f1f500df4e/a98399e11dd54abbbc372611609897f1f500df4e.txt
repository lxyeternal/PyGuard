The current security scores are appropriate; the malware score should remain at 0, obfuscation around 0.7, and risk at 0.2. Continued monitoring for obfuscation tactics is recommended, but no immediate security threat is identified."

The obfuscation and dynamic cache manipulation are typical in such libraries and do not constitute security risks. The malware score is 0, the obfuscation score is 0.2, and the overall security risk score is 0.2, reflecting low risk with minor obfuscation."
