  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate cache management utility with significant obfuscation. There is no direct evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. The obfuscation warrants caution, but overall, the security risk is low. The malware score should remain at 0, with a high obfuscation score (~0.7), and a low risk (~0.2)."
