  "purpose": "Standard package initialization, version check, and module imports for a Python library.",
  "sources": "Reading package version via importlib.metadata.version; importing internal modules and functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external communication; no data leaks or malicious sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Version check and internal module imports; no external or untrusted data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names (e.g., otviBeNxIUMMSyOfobohTcTVixdnjDvp), which are suspicious but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs benign operations typical of package setup: importing version info, defining exports, importing internal modules. No network activity, data exfiltration, or code execution of untrusted data is present. The main concern is obfuscation through variable names, which could be an attempt to conceal intent but does not demonstrate malicious behavior. The scores assigned (malware near 0, obfuscation moderate to high, low security risk) are consistent with this assessment. No evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, or sabotage is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and standard for package initialization, with obfuscated variable names raising suspicion but not evidence of malicious activity. The current security scores are appropriate; the malware score should remain at 0, obfuscation around 0.7, and risk at 0.2. Continued monitoring for obfuscation tactics is recommended, but no immediate security threat is identified.",
