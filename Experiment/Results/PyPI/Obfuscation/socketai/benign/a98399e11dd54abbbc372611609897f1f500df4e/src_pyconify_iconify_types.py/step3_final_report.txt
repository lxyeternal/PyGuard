{
  "purpose": "The code defines static type annotations and data structures using TypedDict, intended solely for type checking and static analysis.",
  "sources": "Type alias definitions and class declarations within the 'if TYPE_CHECKING' block, which are used for static type hints.",
  "sinks": "No runtime data processing, external data sources, or data sinks are present; the code is purely declarative.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources; the code only declares types and data schemas.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation in variable and class names, which could be an attempt to conceal purpose but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists exclusively of type aliases and TypedDict class definitions used for static type checking. No executable logic, network activity, or data manipulation is present. The obfuscated naming pattern raises suspicion but does not indicate malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious behavior, with scores reflecting the static, benign nature of the code. Malware scores are zero; obfuscation scores are high due to naming complexity; security risk scores are very low, justified by the lack of operational code. The code is likely a static schema module with obfuscation that warrants cautious review but no active threat.",
  "conclusion": "This dependency is a static type hinting module with heavily obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious activity or payloads. The high obfuscation score is justified but does not imply malicious intent. Overall, the code is benign, serving as a data schema for static analysis, with minimal security risk.",
