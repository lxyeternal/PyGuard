{
  "purpose": "The code defines a series of type annotations and TypedDict classes for structured data, primarily for type hinting and validation within a larger Python project.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from type annotations, type hints, and class definitions, including string literals, lists, and dictionaries within class structures.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks such as network operations, file writes, or system commands that process untrusted data directly.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted input; the code solely defines data structures for type checking.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains extensive use of nested TypedDicts, string literal definitions, and type annotations that might obscure malicious intent, but no actual malicious or suspicious code is present. The code does not perform any operations, input/output, or data manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of type definitions and annotations using Python's typing system, including conditional imports for type checking. No executable logic, network operations, or data processing are present. There are no signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or malicious behavior. All constructs appear to be for data validation or documentation purposes within a larger codebase.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a static type annotation module that defines data structures for use elsewhere. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be standard type hinting code with no malicious intent.",
