{
  "purpose": "Defines a series of TypedDict classes for type hinting and data structure validation, primarily for configuration or data exchange.",
  "sources": "Imported from __future__ and typing modules, especially within the TYPE_CHECKING block for static type checking.",
  "sinks": "No evident data sinks or untrusted data handling; the code only defines data types and no runtime data processing or I/O.",
  "flows": "No data flows or execution paths, as this code only declares type annotations and class structures.",
  "anomalies": "Contains complex nested TypedDict definitions with many fields; no obvious anomalies or malicious patterns such as hardcoded credentials, code injection, or data leaks.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up type annotations for static analysis purposes. No executable logic, network activity, or dynamic data handling is present. The use of 'if TYPE_CHECKING' suggests these definitions are meant solely for static type checking. No suspicious imports, obfuscated patterns, or signs of malicious intent are detected. The code appears to be a standard setup for type hints in a Python project.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign setup for static type definitions using TypedDicts. It does not contain malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks. No malware or security concerns are evident.",
