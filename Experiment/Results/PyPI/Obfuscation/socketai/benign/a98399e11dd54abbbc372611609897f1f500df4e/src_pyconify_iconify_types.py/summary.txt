  "conclusion": "This dependency is a static type hinting module with heavily obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious activity or payloads. The high obfuscation score is justified but does not imply malicious intent. Overall, the code is benign, serving as a data schema for static analysis, with minimal security risk."
