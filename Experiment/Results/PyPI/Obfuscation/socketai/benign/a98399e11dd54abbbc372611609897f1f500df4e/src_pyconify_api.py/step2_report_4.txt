  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, obfuscation, and overall security risk, based on the provided code and the reports.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions for API, caching, temp files, data processing.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Network requests, file writes, cache modifications, dynamic attribute setting.\n- **Anomalies:** Obfuscated variable names, dynamic cache/global manipulation, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Assessment:** The code uses standard Python practices for API interaction and caching. Obfuscation is minimal and appears to be stylistic rather than malicious. No signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious network activity.\n- **Conclusion:** The code seems legitimate; the obfuscation is likely stylistic, not malicious. Malware score: **0**. Risk score: **0.2** (low, mainly due to dynamic cache/global manipulation).\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** API interaction, cache, temp files, icon data.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Network requests, cache, filesystem.\n- **Anomalies:** Dynamic global cache reconfiguration, use of warnings, static API URL.\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, the code functions as a typical API wrapper. No evidence of malicious behavior. The dynamic cache manipulation could be exploited if external control occurs but is not inherently malicious.\n- **Conclusion:** No malware detected. Malware score: **0**. Risk score: **0.2**.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Icon API client, cache, icon files.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Network requests, file writes, cache.\n- **Anomalies:** Cache reconfiguration, dynamic globals, warnings.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious activity. The code is a utility for icon management.\n- **Conclusion:** Malware score: **0**. Risk score: **0.2**.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Iconify API interaction, cache, icon data.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** API responses, files, network.\n- **Anomalies:** Dynamic cache updates, warnings, no secrets.\n- **Assessment:** Standard API client, no malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Malware score: **0**. Risk score: **0.2**.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Icon data, cache, API, files.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Network, files, warnings.\n- **Anomalies:** Standard patterns, no obfuscation or secrets.\n- **Assessment:** Utility functions for icon management, no malicious signs.\n- **Conclusion:** Malware score: **0**. Risk score: **0.2**.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports indicate no malicious activity (score 0). The code is a typical API wrapper with caching and file management.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** Slight obfuscation (variable names), but not malicious or suspicious.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly elevated (around 0.2), mainly due to dynamic global/cache manipulation, which could be exploited but is not inherently malicious.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no evidence of malware.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0.2** — some variable obfuscation, but not malicious.\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** — minor potential for misuse, but overall low.\n\n**In conclusion, the code appears to be a legitimate utility library for icon API interaction, with no malicious intent or behavior.**",
