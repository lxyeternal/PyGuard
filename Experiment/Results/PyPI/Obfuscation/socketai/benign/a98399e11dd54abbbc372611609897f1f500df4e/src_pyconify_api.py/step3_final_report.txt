  "purpose": "A utility library for interacting with the Iconify icon API, handling icon data retrieval, caching, and file management.",
  "sources": "Network requests to static API endpoints, input parameters for icon data, cache decorators, temporary file creation.",
  "sinks": "Network responses, cached data, temporary files written to disk, global cache and function attribute modifications.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> API requests -> JSON responses -> cache updates -> file writes or in-memory data returns.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, dynamic global attribute setting, cache manipulation functions, no hardcoded secrets or credentials.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a standard API client with caching and file handling. Obfuscated variable names are stylistic and do not indicate malicious intent. Network requests are to a known public API, with proper error handling. No signs of code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. Dynamic cache updates and global attribute modifications are typical for performance and flexibility but could be misused if external control occurs. Overall, the code appears legitimate and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility library for icon API interaction, with no malicious activity or sabotage detected. The obfuscation and dynamic cache manipulation are typical in such libraries and do not constitute security risks. The malware score is 0, the obfuscation score is 0.2, and the overall security risk score is 0.2, reflecting low risk with minor obfuscation.",
