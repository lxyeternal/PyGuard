  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility library for icon API interaction, with no malicious activity or sabotage detected. The obfuscation and dynamic cache manipulation are typical in such libraries and do not constitute security risks. The malware score is 0, the obfuscation score is 0.2, and the overall security risk score is 0.2, reflecting low risk with minor obfuscation."
