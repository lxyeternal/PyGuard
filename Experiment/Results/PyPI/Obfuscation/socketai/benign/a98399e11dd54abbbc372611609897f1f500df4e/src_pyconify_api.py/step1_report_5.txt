{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a library for interacting with the Iconify API, managing icon data, caching, and file handling for icon assets.",
  "sources": "Data is read from environment (e.g., temporary files, environment variables), network requests (API calls using requests.get), and function parameters (user inputs for icon names, keys, queries).",
  "sinks": "Network responses (JSON data, SVG content, version info), file writes (saving SVG files), environment (os.remove), and warnings or exceptions that could be triggered by user inputs.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to form API requests; responses are processed and sometimes saved to files or returned as data. Network data flows into JSON parsing, which then flows into further processing or output.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes warnings for conflicting arguments, dynamic function wrapping, caching mechanisms, and path resolution. There are no obvious hardcoded credentials or backdoors. No obfuscated code segments or unusual language features detected.",
  "analysis": "The code mostly handles API interactions, data caching, and file management for icon assets. It uses standard libraries (requests, os, tempfile) and techniques such as memoization (lru_cache) and temporary file handling. The network requests include timeouts and error handling. No suspicious URL domains are used outside the specified API. No code injection or malicious payloads are evident. Usage of warnings, error raising, and cleanup is standard. Overall, the logic appears to be for utility and data retrieval, not malicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a utility library for icon data retrieval, caching, and file management with no clear malicious intent. It performs network requests, file writes, and data processing in a typical manner. No evidence of malware, sabotage, or malicious behavior found.",
