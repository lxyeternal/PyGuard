  "purpose": "Generate icon theme directories and index files based on input mappings and static dictionaries, creating SVG icon files and organizing them into directories.",
  "sources": "Input parameters, global dictionaries for icon-to-directory mappings, static configuration strings.",
  "sinks": "Filesystem directory creation, SVG file writing, index.theme file generation, cleanup of temporary directories.",
  "flows": "Input data -> Directory and file creation -> SVG bytes generated via imported function -> Index file written.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are obfuscated but no malicious code, network activity, or secrets are present. The nested comprehension for mapping construction is complex but benign.",
  "analysis": "The code creates directories and files for icon themes based on input mappings and static dictionaries. It uses standard filesystem operations, temporary directories with cleanup, and calls an imported function to generate SVG bytes. No network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection is observed. Variable obfuscation is present but not malicious. The overall behavior aligns with legitimate theme generation utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate icon theme generator with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. Obfuscation is minimal and not suspicious. The overall security risk is low.",
