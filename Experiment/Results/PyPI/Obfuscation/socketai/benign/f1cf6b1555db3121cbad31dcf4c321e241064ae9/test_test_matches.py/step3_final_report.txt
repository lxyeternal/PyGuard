  "purpose": "Obfuscated test suite with object creation and assertions, no external I/O or malicious activity observed.",
  "sources": "String literals and function calls with parameters used for object instantiation and assertions.",
  "sinks": "None identified; data flows into object creation and assertions without external data sinks.",
  "flows": "Data from literals and function calls into object constructors and assertion checks.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation, placeholder identifiers (B, C, D, A), suspicious literals ('MEOW', 'red', 'B.D'), incomplete snippets.",
  "analysis": "The code is heavily obfuscated, likely auto-generated or for testing purposes, with no evidence of malicious activity such as network access, data exfiltration, or system modification. The obfuscation and suspicious literals raise caution but do not confirm malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0 or 0.3, obfuscated 0.7-0.8, risk 0.2-0.4) are consistent with this assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be obfuscated test or placeholder code with no current malicious activity. The high obfuscation warrants cautious review but does not justify high malware or security risk scores. Slightly increasing the malware score to around 0.4 could reflect the suspicion due to obfuscation, but overall, the risk remains low.",
