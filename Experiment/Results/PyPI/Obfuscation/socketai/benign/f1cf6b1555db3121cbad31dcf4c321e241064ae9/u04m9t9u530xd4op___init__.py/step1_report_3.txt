{
  "purpose": "The code imports a class or function named UXvalsUWFhuBcbNLJjzXOyuckZYcDWYQ from a local module 'internals' and then deletes the 'internals' reference.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module 'internals'",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform data leaks",
  "flows": "Import from 'internals' -> delete 'internals' reference",
  "anomalies": "The imported name 'UXvalsUWFhuBcbNLJjzXOyuckZYcDWYQ' appears obfuscated or intentionally obscure, which could be an attempt to hide malicious intent. The deletion of the 'internals' module reference immediately after import may be to reduce visibility or traceability.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, performing a single import from a local module and then deleting the reference. The imported symbol has an obfuscated name, which could be an indicator of malicious intent or an attempt at obfuscation. The deletion of the 'internals' object after import may be to prevent further inspection or debugging. There are no obvious data flows, user inputs, or network interactions. The code by itself does not perform any malicious actions but could be part of a larger, malicious module designed to hide or obfuscate behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is very minimal and appears intentionally obfuscated. While it does not contain explicit malicious actions, the obfuscated import and immediate deletion of the 'internals' reference could be indicative of concealment tactics. Without additional context or code, this pattern is suspicious and warrants further review, but as-is, it does not definitively demonstrate malicious behavior.",
