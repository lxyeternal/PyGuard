{
  "purpose": "The code imports a symbol with an obfuscated name from a local module and then deletes the 'internals' reference, likely to hinder static analysis or conceal further activity.",
  "sources": "Import statement from '.internals' module, referencing the symbol 'UXvalsUWFhuBcbNLJjzXOyuckZYcDWYQ'",
  "sinks": "Deletion of the 'internals' reference, which could prevent further inspection or analysis of the imported symbol",
  "flows": "Import of the obfuscated symbol, followed by deletion of the reference, potentially hiding subsequent use or malicious activity",
  "anomalies": "Use of a highly obfuscated symbol name, immediate deletion of the import, and lack of any visible data processing or network activity",
  "analysis": "The code performs a minimal import of an obfuscated symbol from a local module and deletes the reference immediately after. This pattern is suspicious as it may be used to conceal malicious behavior or hinder static analysis. No active malicious actions such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code execution are evident. The obfuscated symbol name and deletion pattern are common in obfuscation tactics, raising suspicion but not confirming malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports—malware around 0.2, obfuscation around 0.8, and moderate risk—are consistent with this assessment. The code alone does not demonstrate malicious activity but warrants further review in a broader context.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits obfuscation tactics and concealment patterns that are suspicious but do not confirm malicious activity in isolation. The scores assigned are appropriate, reflecting high suspicion due to obfuscation but low likelihood of active malware. Further analysis of the larger codebase is recommended to determine if this pattern is part of malicious behavior.",
