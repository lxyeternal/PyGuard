  "purpose": "Analysis of Python code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on supply chain threats, obfuscation, and suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Code input, data read operations, environment variables, network connections, dynamic code execution points (eval/exec).",
  "sinks": "Potential data exfiltration points, network communication, system modifications, dynamic code execution, external resource access.",
  "flows": "From data sources (inputs, environment variables) through code execution paths (eval/exec, network calls) to sinks (data leaks, remote servers).",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec, obfuscated strings, suspicious external addresses, hardcoded secrets, unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The reports generally identify benign, minimal code with low suspicion, assigning low malware and obfuscation scores. Report 4 highlights significant suspicious features such as eval/exec and obfuscation, justifying higher scores. The scores are consistent with the evidence; the only adjustment recommended is increasing the risk score for Report 4 from 0.65 to 0.7 to better reflect the severity of the suspicious features. The confidence levels align with the amount of evidence and suspicion. Overall, the assessments are well-founded and appropriately cautious, with the exception of slightly underestimating the risk in Report 4.",
  "conclusion": "Most code is benign with low security risk; Report 4 contains suspicious features warranting higher malware, obfuscation, and risk scores. The current scoring is appropriate, with a recommended slight increase in the risk score for Report 4 to 0.7. All other reports are consistent with their benign assessments.",
