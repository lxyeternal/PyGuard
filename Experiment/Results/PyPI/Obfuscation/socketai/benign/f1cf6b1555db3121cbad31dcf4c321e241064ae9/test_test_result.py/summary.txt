  "conclusion": "Most code is benign with low security risk; Report 4 contains suspicious features warranting higher malware, obfuscation, and risk scores. The current scoring is appropriate, with a recommended slight increase in the risk score for Report 4 to 0.7. All other reports are consistent with their benign assessments."
