The high obfuscation score reflects the variable naming but does not imply malicious behavior. Overall, the code is safe, with low security risk."

      "conclusion": "The code is a testing utility for cloud storage interactions, with no evidence of malicious activity. The high obfuscation and extensive mocking could be exploited maliciously if embedded in a supply chain, but static analysis shows no active malware. The scores reflect low malware risk, moderate obfuscation, and low overall risk, consistent with the code's purpose and structure."
