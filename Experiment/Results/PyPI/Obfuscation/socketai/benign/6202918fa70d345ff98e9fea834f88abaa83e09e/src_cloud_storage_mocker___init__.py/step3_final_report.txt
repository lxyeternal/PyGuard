  "purpose": "Conditional import setup from 'cloud_storage_mocker' with version handling and exporting specific symbols for a mocking/testing library.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'cloud_storage_mocker' modules, reading version info and core functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows are present.",
  "flows": "Import statements and variable assignments; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated variable names, broad exception handling, internal module imports, which could be used to conceal intent.",
  "analysis": "The code performs benign import operations with obfuscated variable names, likely for internal or version concealment. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious functions are evident. The broad exception handling is typical for optional dependencies but could hide import issues. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not necessarily indicate malicious intent. All indicators point to a setup or testing utility, not malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as an import setup for a mocking library with obfuscated variable names. No malicious activity or security risks are detected. The high obfuscation score reflects the variable naming but does not imply malicious behavior. Overall, the code is safe, with low security risk.",
