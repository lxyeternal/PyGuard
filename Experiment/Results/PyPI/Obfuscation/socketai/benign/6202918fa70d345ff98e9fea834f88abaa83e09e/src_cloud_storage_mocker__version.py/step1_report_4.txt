  "purpose": "Assignment of a version string to a variable, likely indicating a package or dependency version.",
  "sources": "The right-hand side string '0.3.4' as a literal value.",
  "sinks": "Assignment operation; no untrusted input or data sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Assignment of a constant string to a variable; no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with no suspicious constructs, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static version string to a variable with an obfuscated variable name. There is no indication of data input, network activity, or other potentially malicious behavior. The variable name appears deliberately obscure, but this alone does not imply malicious intent; it could be an obfuscated or placeholder variable. The code does not perform any operations beyond this assignment.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists solely of a variable assignment of a version string to an obfuscated variable name, with no evidence of malicious activity or security risks.",
