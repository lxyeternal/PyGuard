{
  "purpose": "Assigns a version string \"0.3.4\" to an obfuscated variable, likely representing dependency version info.",
  "sources": "None; the code is a direct assignment with no external input or data flow.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code is a simple assignment without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable name; no malicious code or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward assignment of a version string to an obfuscated variable name. No external inputs, outputs, or malicious activities are present. The obfuscation of the variable name could be suspicious in a broader context but is not inherently malicious here. The malware score is 0, security risk is minimal, and confidence is high that this is benign code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, representing a typical dependency version declaration with obfuscated variable naming. No malicious intent or security risks are evident based solely on this snippet.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0.3,
