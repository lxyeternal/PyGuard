  "anomalies": [
    "Use of importlib.metadata.version with dynamic __name__ manipulation is common, but the specific method could be manipulated if package metadata is compromised. No other suspicious code behavior detected."
  ],
  "analysis": "The code primarily initializes a package by importing metadata, several submodules with obfuscated names, and defining public API variables. The use of importlib.metadata.version to dynamically set __version__ is standard but could potentially be exploited if package metadata is compromised. The imported submodules have non-descriptive names, which might indicate obfuscation, but no malicious behavior is evident from this snippet alone. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network or file operations. The code does not contain any user input handling, environment variable misuse, or data leaks. Overall, this is a standard package initialization script with no direct indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a typical package initializer, importing modules and setting version information. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected. The obfuscated module names are suspicious but not inherently malicious; more context would be needed to confirm intent. Overall, the code appears benign.",
