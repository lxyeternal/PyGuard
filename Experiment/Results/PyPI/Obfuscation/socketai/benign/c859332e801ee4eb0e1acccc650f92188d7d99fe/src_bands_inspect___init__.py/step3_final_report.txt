  "purpose": "Package initialization script importing modules with obfuscated names, setting version info, and defining exports.",
  "sources": "Import statements for `importlib.metadata` and obfuscated modules; use of `__name__` for version retrieval.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network communication, or data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "Importing modules with obfuscated names, setting `__version__`, defining `__all__`.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated module names; dynamic version retrieval based on `__name__` manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard package initializer with module imports and version setting. The main concern is the obfuscated module names, which could be used to conceal malicious code, but no evidence of malicious activity is present. The malware score is 0, aligning with the absence of malicious behavior. Obfuscation scores are high (~0.7), reflecting suspicion but not proof of malicious intent. Security risk scores are low (~0.2-0.3), consistent with the benign nature of the code. The code does not perform network operations, data leaks, or code injections. The obfuscation warrants caution but is not definitive proof of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical package initialization with obfuscated module names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, but obfuscation raises suspicion. Scores are appropriately assigned, with malware at 0, obfuscated at ~0.7, and low risk. Continuous monitoring and further inspection of the actual modules are recommended to confirm their safety.",
