  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical package initialization with obfuscated module names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, but obfuscation raises suspicion. Scores are appropriately assigned, with malware at 0, obfuscated at ~0.7, and low risk. Continuous monitoring and further inspection of the actual modules are recommended to confirm their safety."
