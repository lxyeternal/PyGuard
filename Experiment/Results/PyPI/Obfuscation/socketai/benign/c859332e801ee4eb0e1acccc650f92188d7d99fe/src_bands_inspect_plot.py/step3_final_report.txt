{
  "purpose": "The code provides visualization functions for plotting energy or k-point data, with label processing and axis configuration.",
  "sources": "Data inputs to plotting functions, label attributes, and data sequences within the functions.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network, or file operations are present; data flows are confined within plotting routines.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through plotting and label processing functions to the visualization output.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with non-descriptive variable names; no malicious code or backdoors evident; complex label handling could be used to hide malicious payloads but no such activity is observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is heavily obfuscated but primarily performs plotting using matplotlib, setting axes, labels, and processing label data. No network, file, or system commands are executed. The obfuscation could be stylistic or to conceal malicious intent, but no malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or system modification is detected. The functions are consistent with scientific visualization tasks, and no hardcoded secrets or injection points are present. The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not indicate malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign visualization utility with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious intent or activity, and the supply chain risk is low. The high obfuscation should be noted, but without active malicious behavior, the code is considered safe.",
