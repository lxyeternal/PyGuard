  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a benign utility for coordinate transformations with obfuscated naming. There are no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. The obfuscation is suspicious but not malicious. The current scores are appropriate; malware score is 0, obfuscation score around 0.75, and low security risk (~0.1). No immediate concerns are present, but obfuscation should be monitored if further code is obtained."
