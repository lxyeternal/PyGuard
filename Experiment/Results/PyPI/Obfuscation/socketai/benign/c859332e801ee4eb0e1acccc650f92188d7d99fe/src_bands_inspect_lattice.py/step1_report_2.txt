{
  "purpose": "Define a class for handling 3x3 matrices with operations related to coordinate transformations, inverses, and norms, likely for scientific or mathematical computations.",
  "sources": "Input: matrix parameter during initialization; no external input read during execution.",
  "sinks": "Methods return transformed matrices, coordinate transformations, or computed norms; no untrusted data sinks evident.",
  "flows": "The class transforms coordinates and computes norms using matrix operations, with internal data flow between methods and object properties.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated method names and property, no explicit hardcoded credentials or suspicious data handling. No hidden or unusual code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class that encapsulates matrix operations including inversion, transposition, coordinate transformations, and distance calculations. The class methods use standard numpy and scipy functions for linear algebra, with no signs of malicious code or unusual data flows. The export decorator might be intended for packaging, but does not imply malicious intent. No external data inputs, network activity, or credential handling present. No obfuscated or malicious code detected. The code appears to serve a mathematical purpose typical for scientific computing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a mathematical utility class with no evident malicious intent or security risks. It is obfuscated in naming but functionally standard for scientific computation purposes.",
