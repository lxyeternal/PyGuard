  "purpose": "Importing modules or components, potentially for internal use within a package.",
  "sources": "Module imports using relative import syntax.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; imports do not execute untrusted code or data.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual module name 'OllGmUAOnbyAPIXhiWEhgTrGcPQlGOBh' which appears as a random or obfuscated identifier. No other code present to analyze further.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains two import statements with relative import syntax. The second module name appears obfuscated or auto-generated, which could be suspicious but is not inherently malicious. No code execution, data handling, or external communication is present in this snippet. Due to lack of executable code, malicious behavior detection is limited.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of import statements with a potentially obfuscated module name. No evidence of malicious activity or security risks based solely on this fragment.",
