  "purpose": "Importing modules or components, likely part of a package's internal structure.",
  "sources": "Import statements at the beginning of the code, referencing local modules.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows identified in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of an unusually named module 'OllGmUAOnbyAPIXhiWEhgTrGcPQlGOBh' which appears obfuscated or randomly generated.",
  "analysis": "The code contains two import statements: one importing 'difference' and another importing a module with a highly obfuscated or nonsensical name. The first import is straightforward, but the second module's name appears suspicious due to its randomness or obfuscation, which could indicate an attempt to hide malicious code or backdoors. No other code, function calls, or data handling is present. The snippet alone does not demonstrate malicious behavior but the obfuscated module warrants further investigation to rule out malicious intent or hidden payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily performs module imports with one potentially obfuscated module name. While this alone is not definitive evidence of malicious behavior, the suspiciously named import suggests a need for further review of the module's contents. No direct malicious activity is evident in this snippet.",
