{
  "purpose": "Importing modules or components within the package, likely for internal use.",
  "sources": "Imports from the current package (`.`), specifically modules named 'difference' and a seemingly obfuscated or random module name 'OllGmUAOnbyAPIXhiWEhgTrGcPQlGOBh'.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling points are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Imports suggest potential internal usage but no data flow or external interactions are shown here.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a module with a non-descriptive, seemingly random or obfuscated name 'OllGmUAOnbyAPIXhiWEhgTrGcPQlGOBh'. This could indicate obfuscation or concealment. No other suspicious code or patterns are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code performs simple relative imports from the current package. The module 'difference' appears straightforward. The other module's name is unusually long and random, which could be benign or a sign of obfuscation. There are no functions, data handling, or malicious constructs present. The snippet is minimal, limiting analysis to potential obfuscation or concealment. No external network or data operations are visible.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal, performing internal imports. The obfuscated module name warrants suspicion but could also be auto-generated or intentionally obscured. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks based solely on this snippet.",
