  "purpose": "Performs eigenvalue shift optimization to align two eigenvalue sets by minimizing a difference metric.",
  "sources": "Eigenvalues objects with method 'mfFBmVXOSHNdzdFKizKffpNozuILPFpd', external 'calculate_diff' function, inputs to optimization routine.",
  "sinks": "Resulting structured output; no external data leaks or system interactions.",
  "flows": "Eigenvalues are shifted via method calls, passed into 'calculate_diff', and optimized through 'scipy.optimize.minimize'.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of variable and function names; no suspicious network, file, or environment interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard eigenvalue shift and difference minimization routine, using obfuscated identifiers likely for IP protection. No malicious patterns such as network activity, data exfiltration, or destructive operations are present. The obfuscation is consistent with intellectual property concealment rather than malicious intent. The external 'calculate_diff' function's purpose appears legitimate. The optimization process and data flow are contained within the code, with no external side effects. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, low security risk) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate scientific routine for eigenvalue alignment with obfuscated naming, presenting no evidence of malicious activity or security threats. The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not imply malicious intent. Overall, the code poses minimal security risk.",
