  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a scientific eigenvalue analysis CLI tool with heavily obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious payloads, network activity, or sabotage. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not justify classifying the code as malware or a high security threat. The low malware and risk scores are appropriate; the high obfuscation score reflects the variable naming patterns and inconsistencies."
