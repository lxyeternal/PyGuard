{
  "purpose": "The code performs eigenvalue comparison, weighted averaging, and range filtering for scientific or mathematical analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads eigenvalues from object attributes and input parameters; uses default functions for averaging and range checks.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network activity, or file I/O; computations are self-contained.",
  "flows": "Eigenvalues are compared and processed; data flows from input objects through calculations to return values.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names, but no malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious external calls.",
  "analysis": "The code validates eigenvalue sets, computes weighted averages, and filters data within specified ranges. No signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or system modification. Obfuscation appears limited to naming conventions rather than malicious obfuscation techniques. The logic is consistent with scientific computation, and no external or malicious signals are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate scientific utility for eigenvalue analysis with obfuscated identifiers but no malicious intent or security risks. The malware score is set to 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.2). Obfuscation is moderate due to nonsensical variable names, but this does not imply malicious activity.",
