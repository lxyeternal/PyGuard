  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** The code performs eigenvalue comparison, weighted averaging, and filtering. No suspicious behaviors, no network or file I/O, no hardcoded secrets. The logic is consistent with scientific computations.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The low security risk and malware scores are justified. No obfuscation detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on eigenvalue processing and filtering. No external system effects or malicious behaviors. The code is standard scientific code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns; no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** Noted obfuscated variable and function names, but no malicious activity. The obfuscation could be auto-generated naming rather than malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0.7, confidence=0.8.\n- **Assessment:** The high obfuscation score is justified due to nonsensical names, but no malware or malicious activity is present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous reports, straightforward scientific computations, despite obfuscated variable names. No malicious behaviors.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, obfuscated=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher obfuscation score, but still consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** Clear eigenvalue processing, no external system effects, no malicious activity. Obfuscation in naming but benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, obfuscated=0.3, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Justified.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis and Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on zero, and the code contains no suspicious network, file, or system modifications. The code is purely computational.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Variable and function names are nonsensical, which suggests obfuscation. The scores vary from 0.2 to 0.7, but overall, the obfuscation appears to be due to naming conventions, not malicious obfuscation techniques.\n- **Risk Score:** The overall security risk is very low, consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### My Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0.0** — no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0.3** — some obfuscation due to variable names, but not malicious.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.2** — minimal security concern, primarily due to obfuscation.\n\n**Note:** The code appears to be a scientific utility for eigenvalue analysis, with no security threats or malware involved. The obfuscation is superficial, likely due to variable naming conventions or auto-generation, not malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Estimated Score |\n|-----------------|------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0.0                    |\n| Obfuscated      | 0.3                    |\n| Security Risk   | 0.2                    |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed reasoning above.",
