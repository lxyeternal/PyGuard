  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate scientific utility for eigenvalue analysis with obfuscated identifiers but no malicious intent or security risks. The malware score is set to 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.2). Obfuscation is moderate due to nonsensical variable names, but this does not imply malicious activity."
