{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform computations involving eigenvalues, specifically comparing eigenvalues and calculating a weighted difference between two sets, possibly for analysis or validation purposes.",
  "sources": "Inputs: eigenvals1 and eigenvals2 objects, environment variables for defaults, and a pair of boundary values for the second function.",
  "sinks": "Data processing functions; no direct data leaks or external data transmissions observed. No system commands or network activities are present.",
  "flows": "Eigenvalues are extracted from objects, compared for consistency, then used in mean calculations and difference computations; no external output or network flow is apparent.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses obfuscated-looking variable names, but the structure is straightforward. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior detected. The 'export' decorator suggests intended external use, but no malicious activity is evident.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily defines two functions: one for comparing and processing eigenvalues with optional averaging and weighting, and another for creating a boolean mask based on input bounds. The first function verifies eigenvalue consistency, computes a weighted average (possibly configurable), and calculates the absolute difference between eigenvalues. The second function generates a logical mask for values within a specified interval. No external data access, network calls, file operations, or suspicious behaviors are observed. The code structure is consistent and clear, despite the obfuscated variable names.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs mathematical computations on eigenvalues with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It is a legitimate data processing utility with no signs of malware or malicious behaviors. The obfuscation appears to be solely in variable naming, not in malicious obfuscation techniques.",
