The obfuscation is suspicious but not malicious. The current scores are appropriate; malware score is 0, obfuscation score around 0.75, and low security risk (~0.1). No immediate concerns are present, but obfuscation should be monitored if further code is obtained."

No immediate security concerns are identified."

There is no evidence of malicious payloads, network activity, or sabotage. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not justify classifying the code as malware or a high security threat. The low malware and risk scores are appropriate; the high obfuscation score reflects the variable naming patterns and inconsistencies."

The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate given the evidence; the high obfuscation score reflects suspicion, but the malware and risk scores remain low due to lack of concrete malicious activity. Further review of the actual module contents is recommended if possible."
