  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script or module, but without actual code provided, the purpose cannot be definitively determined.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly visible; if present, they might include environment variables, file reads, network requests, or user input functions, but none are shown.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, network communication, file writes, or subprocess executions, none of which are explicitly present in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flow analysis cannot be performed without concrete code; typically, flows would connect sources to sinks, but no such flow is identifiable here.",
  "anomalies": "No code provided to analyze; therefore, no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or unusual behavior can be identified.",
  "analysis": "The review was conducted without specific code content. No suspicious or malicious patterns are evident without the actual code. The absence of provided code prevents detailed source, sink, or flow analysis. Standard security issues cannot be evaluated without concrete implementation details.",
  "conclusion": "No code provided for analysis; thus, no malicious behavior, anomalies, or security risks can be confirmed. The review is inconclusive due to lack of actual code content.",
