  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, focusing on eval/exec usage, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, and dynamic execution.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, user input, and external data; sinks involve eval/exec, network connections, file operations, and system commands.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks or code execution points such as eval/exec on untrusted data, network transmissions, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources like user input or environment variables to sinks such as eval/exec or system calls, indicating potential malicious or unsafe behavior.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec with untrusted data, hardcoded secrets, high obfuscation, complex control flow, and dynamic code execution without validation.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits patterns of unsafe eval/exec usage, obfuscation, and dynamic execution, which are high-risk indicators. Some reports lack code, correctly resulting in low scores. Reports with code show justified high malware and security risk scores, especially where eval() on untrusted input is present. Obfuscation scores align with the described complexity. Slightly increasing malware suspicion in reports with obfuscation and dynamic code is warranted.",
  "conclusion": "The provided reports are generally consistent and appropriately score the suspicious behaviors. The highest concern is eval() on untrusted data combined with obfuscation, which warrants a malware score around 0.6–0.7 and a risk score near 0.65. Minor adjustments to reflect suspicion levels are recommended, especially increasing malware scores for heavily obfuscated and dynamic code patterns.",
