  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with low security risk; report 4's obfuscation and dynamic execution patterns suggest moderate concern, warranting a slight increase in malware score. The current scores are reasonable; minor adjustments improve accuracy. The overall supply chain risk remains low to moderate, primarily driven by report 4's suspicious patterns."
