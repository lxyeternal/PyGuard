{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be the initialization and setup of a Python package or script, potentially involving configuration and utility functions.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from environment variables and possibly user input via functions like input() or from configuration files if present.",
  "sinks": "Data could be sent over network connections, written to files, or used in subprocesses; specific sinks are not explicitly shown in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or user input (sources) into functions and variables that process or output data; without network or file operations explicitly shown, flow paths are limited.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are detected. No unusual dynamic code execution or cryptic variable names observed. The code structure appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes standard modules, reads environment variables, and defines functions. There is no evidence of malicious intent such as network connections to suspicious domains, data exfiltration, or backdoors. No obfuscation, suspicious imports, or code patterns typical of malware are present. The lack of explicit network activity or sensitive data handling suggests a benign purpose. Without additional context or hidden code, the code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup or configuration script with no apparent malicious behavior. It does not contain suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads. Based on the available content, it is unlikely to be malicious or a security threat.",
