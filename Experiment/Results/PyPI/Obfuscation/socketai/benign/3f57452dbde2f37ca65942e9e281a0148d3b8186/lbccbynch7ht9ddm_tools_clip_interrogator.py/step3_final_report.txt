  "purpose": "Analysis of Python package code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks, focusing on patterns like dynamic execution, hardcoded secrets, and suspicious data flows.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, input functions, dynamic code execution points (eval/exec), file reads, network connections.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data handling, network transmission, environment variable access, file modifications, dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or input functions flow into eval/exec or network transmission points, potentially leading to malicious actions or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval/exec with obfuscated variable names, hardcoded secrets, suspicious environment variable reads, dynamic code patterns, inconsistent confidence scores in empty code scenario.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits patterns of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are common in malicious payloads but can also be benign. Reports 1-3 and 5 correctly identify benign patterns with low scores and high confidence. Report 4 shows obfuscation and eval/exec usage, raising suspicion; scores of malware=0.3 and obfuscated=0.6 are justified but could be slightly increased to reflect the potential risk. Report 5's high confidence is inconsistent given no code; it should be lowered. Overall, the scores align with the evidence, with the main concern in report 4 due to obfuscation and dynamic code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with low security risk; report 4's obfuscation and dynamic execution patterns suggest moderate concern, warranting a slight increase in malware score. The current scores are reasonable; minor adjustments improve accuracy. The overall supply chain risk remains low to moderate, primarily driven by report 4's suspicious patterns.",
