  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform data processing or utility functions, but the exact intent is unclear without detailed context.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables, function parameters, and possibly external modules or files.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or data outputs; specific sinks are not explicitly shown in the provided fragment.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources such as environment variables and function arguments to processing functions, and potentially to external sinks like network or file outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hard-coded credentials, suspicious functions, or obfuscated code are observed. The code appears standard without malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and primarily composed of standard Python constructs. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. Usage of third-party libraries, if any, appears legitimate. Without additional context or more code, no malicious or security risks are evident. The structure suggests normal utility operations, with no indicators of obfuscation or malware.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears benign and does not pose an immediate threat. Confidence in this assessment is high, but the limited scope means subtle issues cannot be entirely ruled out.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
