  "purpose": "The code appears benign, with no suspicious patterns or malicious indicators.",
  "sources": "No specific input or data sources identified; code is straightforward or absent.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or potential data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "No data flows indicating malicious activity; code execution appears normal.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious constructs observed; code is either minimal or missing.",
  "analysis": "The code shows no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior. The scores reflect low suspicion: malware score 0, obfuscation 0, and low security risk 0.2. Confidence is moderate (0.7) due to lack of detailed code. Overall, the assessment indicates a benign status with minimal risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no malicious intent or suspicious patterns. The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate, and the minimal security risk aligns with the analysis. No further action required.",
