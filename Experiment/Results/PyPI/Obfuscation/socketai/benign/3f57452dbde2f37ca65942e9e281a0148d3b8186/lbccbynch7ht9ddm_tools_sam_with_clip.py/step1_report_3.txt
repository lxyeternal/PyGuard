  "purpose": "This code appears to be a standard Python script intended for data processing or manipulation, with no immediately obvious malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function arguments, file reads, or environment variables (if any). Specific source points are not explicitly visible in the provided code snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system commands, network requests, file writes, or evaluation/execution functions. No explicit dangerous sinks are identified in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (e.g., function parameters, environment variables) through processing functions, with possible outputs to files, network, or system commands. No suspicious source-to-sink flow detected in the snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscation, or unusual code patterns are present. No backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code lacks obfuscation, unnecessary dynamic execution, or suspicious library usage. It performs typical data handling tasks. Without additional context, it appears benign. No anomalous code constructs or security vulnerabilities are detected in the visible snippet.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems to serve a legitimate purpose without any suspicious or malicious activities.",
