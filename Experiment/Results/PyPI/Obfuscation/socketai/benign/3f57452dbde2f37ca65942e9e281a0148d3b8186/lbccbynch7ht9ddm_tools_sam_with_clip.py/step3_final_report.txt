{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a straightforward Python script with no malicious or obfuscated elements, primarily performing simple input/output operations.",
  "sources": "Reads input from the user via input() function and possibly environment variables if used, but none are explicitly shown.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to the console using print(), no untrusted data flows identified that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from input() to processing (if any), then to print() for output; no external network or file operations are observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected; code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is simple, with no obfuscation or suspicious behavior. It reads user input and displays output, with no external data sources or sinks. The lack of complex logic or external calls indicates a benign purpose. Given the limited code snippet, the assessment relies on the assumption that no hidden or malicious code exists outside the visible scope. The security risk is minimal, and malware likelihood is negligible.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk score of 0.2 and malware score of 0 are appropriate, reflecting a safe and straightforward script.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
