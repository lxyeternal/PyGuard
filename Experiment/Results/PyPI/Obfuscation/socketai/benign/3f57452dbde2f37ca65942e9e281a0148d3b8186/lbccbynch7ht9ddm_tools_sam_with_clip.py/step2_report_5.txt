  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report, cross-check their claims, and assess their scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** General statement; no specific code snippet provided. Concludes low risk, no malware, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.8.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The report's conclusion aligns with the absence of code snippets and suspicious patterns.\n- The low security risk score (0.2) seems reasonable given the lack of evidence.\n- The confidence is high (0.8), appropriate for limited code context.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Again, no explicit code; general statements about benign structure.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.6.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The cautious approach is justified; no malicious indicators are identified.\n- The confidence is slightly lower than Report 1, which makes sense given the limited info.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores seem appropriate; no concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to previous; no code snippet, general benign assumptions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Very low security risk score aligns with the analysis.\n- High confidence is justified due to the lack of suspicious features.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Minimal code, straightforward input/output, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.8.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The low risk and malware scores are justified.\n- The confidence is appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** No code provided; appropriately notes inability to analyze.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Fully justified; no code means no basis for any risk assessment.\n\n---\n\n### General Observations & Recommendations:\n\n- All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious or obfuscated code.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the lack of evidence.\n- The confidence levels appropriately reflect the limited information.\n\n### Final Aggregate Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on zero; I concur. No evidence suggests malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Zero across all reports; consistent with the absence of obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low, mostly 0.1-0.2, reflecting minimal security concerns.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, standard benign scripts)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nAll reports are consistent, cautious, and appropriately score the risk based on the limited information. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final note:** Given the absence of code snippets, the assessments are inherently limited, but based on the provided summaries, the conclusions are justified.",
