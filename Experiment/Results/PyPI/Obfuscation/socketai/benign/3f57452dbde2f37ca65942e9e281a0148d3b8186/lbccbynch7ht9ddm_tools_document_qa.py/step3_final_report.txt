  "purpose": "Analyze open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code input, environment variables, network connections, file operations, data handling functions.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission points, file writes, system commands, environment variable access, data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input sources to processing functions, then to sinks such as network or file outputs, potentially leading to data exfiltration or system compromise.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code, no suspicious constructs, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no network connections or data leaks observed.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is absent; reports indicate no malicious or suspicious behavior. The only code snippet appears benign, with no obfuscation or malicious patterns. Scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the evidence. Confidence is high in the absence of code, but slightly lower if code were available. No anomalies detected. Overall, the dependency appears safe based on current information.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency shows no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a minimal security risk score of 0.1 reflecting the benign assessment. No further action required unless new code or evidence emerges.",
