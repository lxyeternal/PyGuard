  "sources": "The code reads data from variables, function parameters, or possibly environment variables, though specific input sources are not clearly visible due to the blank input.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communication functions, file writing, or system commands if present, but none are explicitly evident in the provided code fragment.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through various processing steps, potentially reaching sinks such as network or file system, but specific flow paths cannot be confirmed due to incomplete code.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies or suspicious constructs are identifiable within the provided code snippet. The code appears standard without hardcoded credentials or obfuscated parts.",
  "analysis": "The code fragment lacks specific details, comments, or complex logic that could suggest malicious intent. It does not contain evident malicious behaviors such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The overall structure appears typical of benign utility scripts.",
