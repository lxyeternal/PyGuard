  "purpose": "Assess the supply chain security risks of the open source Python dependency based on provided reports, identifying malicious behaviors, obfuscation, and security threats.",
  "sources": "Potential use of eval/exec, hardcoded credentials/URLs, network calls to suspicious domains, obfuscated code segments, complex control flow, and data handling patterns.",
  "sinks": "Network communication (data exfiltration), dynamic code execution points, access to environment variables or secrets, file modifications, and potential command injections.",
  "flows": "Input sources such as hardcoded strings or network responses flow into eval/exec or control structures; obfuscated code and dynamic execution pathways lead to data exfiltration or system modification points.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval/exec, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, complex control flow, suspicious network activity, inconsistent variable naming, and incomplete code snippets indicating potential concealment.",
  "analysis": "The reports consistently identify eval/exec usage, hardcoded credentials, network activity to unverified domains, and obfuscation as indicators of malicious intent. High scores (0.75 malware, 0.8 security risk, 0.7-0.8 obfuscation) are justified if such patterns are confirmed in the actual code. Benign reports show no suspicious features, aligning with low scores (0 malware, 0.2 risk, 0 obfuscation). The scores across reports are coherent with their descriptions, with high suspicion in reports 1 and 2, and benign assessments in others. Without concrete code, these evaluations are based on the summaries provided, but they are consistent and justified given the described anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The overall assessment indicates high malicious potential in reports citing eval/exec, hardcoded secrets, and network activity, warranting high malware and security risk scores. Benign reports are appropriately scored low. The scores are consistent with the described behaviors, and further code review is recommended to confirm malicious patterns.",
