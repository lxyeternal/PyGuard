  "purpose": "Analysis of Python package code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, input functions, dynamic imports, eval/exec statements, hardcoded URLs/credentials, obfuscated variables.",
  "sinks": "Potential network connections, file operations, system commands, data exfiltration points, dynamic code execution paths.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables and input feed into eval/exec or dynamic imports, which then lead to network or system operations, possibly exfiltrating data or executing malicious payloads.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec, dynamic import statements, obfuscated variable names, hardcoded secrets, complex control flow, misleading variable names, conditional branches designed to obscure intent.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets exhibit varying degrees of obfuscation and dynamic execution. Reports 2 and 5 contain clear indicators of malicious or suspicious activity, such as eval/exec usage, hardcoded credentials, and obfuscation, justifying high malware and obfuscation scores. Reports 1 and 3 show benign patterns with no suspicious activity, reflected in low scores. Report 4 involves dynamic execution and input handling but lacks confirmed malicious payloads, warranting moderate risk scores. The overall assessment aligns with the described features, with high suspicion in reports 2 and 5, and benign assessments in 1 and 3. Slight score adjustments could be made for conservativeness, but current scores are justified based on indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The analysis confirms that reports 2 and 5 contain significant indicators of malicious or obfuscated code, warranting high malware and obfuscation scores. Reports 1 and 3 are benign with minimal risk. Report 4 presents potential risks but no confirmed malicious activity. Overall, the package exhibits moderate supply chain security concerns primarily driven by obfuscation and dynamic code execution indicators. Further static and dynamic analysis is recommended for suspicious snippets to confirm malicious intent.",
