  "confidence": 0.85,
  "conclusion": "The analysis confirms that reports 2 and 5 contain significant indicators of malicious or obfuscated code, warranting high malware and obfuscation scores. Reports 1 and 3 are benign with minimal risk. Report 4 presents potential risks but no confirmed malicious activity. Overall, the package exhibits moderate supply chain security concerns primarily driven by obfuscation and dynamic code execution indicators. Further static and dynamic analysis is recommended for suspicious snippets to confirm malicious intent."
