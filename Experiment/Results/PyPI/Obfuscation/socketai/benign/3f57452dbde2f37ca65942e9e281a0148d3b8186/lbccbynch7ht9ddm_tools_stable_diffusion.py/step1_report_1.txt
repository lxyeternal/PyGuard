  "purpose": "The code appears to initialize a Python module, possibly setting up some configuration or environment variables, but the specific purpose is unclear due to lack of comments or context.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from environment variables, imported modules, and potentially from user input or system files.",
  "sinks": "The code writes data to environment variables, logs, or external systems; it may execute commands or load data from external sources.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or user inputs into internal variables, possibly leading to execution or external communication based on these values.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies like hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious functions. The code structure seems standard but minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code's limited snippet makes it difficult to fully assess, but it seems to be standard setup code with no apparent malicious behavior. There are no suspicious imports, hardcoded secrets, or risky operations evident in the visible portion. Without further context or hidden code, no malicious intent or security risks are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be benign setup or configuration code, with no indicators of malware, data leaks, or supply chain sabotage.",
