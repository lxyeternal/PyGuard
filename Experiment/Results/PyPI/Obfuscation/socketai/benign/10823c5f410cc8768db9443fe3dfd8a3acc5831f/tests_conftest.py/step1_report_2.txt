  "purpose": "Define pytest fixtures for directory properties related to user and site data locations.",
  "sources": "Import statements, type annotations, and the PROPS tuple which lists directory property names.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data flows or causes harm. No external data output or network communication.",
  "flows": "Fixtures access the PROPS tuple, perform simple string replacements, and return property names as strings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors observed. Use of type casting is standard in type hinting.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and pytest fixtures. It defines a list of directory property names and provides fixtures to supply these names and modified versions (replacing '_dir' with '_path'). All operations are straightforward, primarily involving string handling and fixture setup for testing purposes. There are no data leaks, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. The code appears to be standard test fixture code for directory property names.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup for pytest testing fixtures related to directory paths. No malicious activity or security risks are present.",
