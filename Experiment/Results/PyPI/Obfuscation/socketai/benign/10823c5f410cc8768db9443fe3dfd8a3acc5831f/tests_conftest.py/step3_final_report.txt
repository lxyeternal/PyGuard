  "purpose": "Define pytest fixtures for directory property names and their path variants for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Static list PROPS; request.param in fixtures",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processed or external communication",
  "flows": "Fixtures return static strings or modified strings; no data flow to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Use of cast() for type hinting only; no malicious or obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code defines static directory property names and fixtures that return these names or their modified versions. It uses cast() solely for type safety, with no external input, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The code is straightforward, intended for test setup, and contains no obfuscation or malicious payloads. All signals indicate benign behavior, with no data leaks, security issues, or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward pytest fixture setup for directory property names. It contains no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and poses no security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and justified.",
