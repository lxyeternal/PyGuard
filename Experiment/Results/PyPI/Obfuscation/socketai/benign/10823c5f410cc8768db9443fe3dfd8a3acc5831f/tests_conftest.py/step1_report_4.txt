  "purpose": "This code defines fixtures for testing directory paths related to user and site data using pytest.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the module import statements, the PROPS tuple, and request parameters in fixtures.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or data flow to sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from request parameters in fixtures to the returned strings, with some string manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future annotations and typing modules, defines a tuple of directory property names, and creates pytest fixtures that provide these property names and their modified forms. The fixtures are straightforward and used for test parametrization. No untrusted input processing or external data handling occurs. The code appears clean, well-structured, and intended solely for testing purposes without any suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard pytest fixture setup for directory path testing. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks are detected. It is safe and does not contain malware.",
