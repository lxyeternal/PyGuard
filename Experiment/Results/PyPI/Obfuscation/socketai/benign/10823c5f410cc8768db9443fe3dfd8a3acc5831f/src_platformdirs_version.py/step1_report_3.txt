  "purpose": "Define version information and type checking variables for the package",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and version tuples",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data handling or external outputs",
  "flows": "Not applicable; simple variable assignments without data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs present; straightforward version definition",
  "analysis": "The code sets up version-related variables, conditionally defining a type alias based on TYPE_CHECKING. The version string is hardcoded as '4.3.7' and assigned to multiple variables, with a tuple representing the version. There are no external inputs, no data flows from untrusted sources, and no suspicious or malicious constructs observed. The code appears to be standard version management boilerplate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely establishing version metadata without any malicious intent or security risks.",
