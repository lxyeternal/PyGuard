  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code defines version information variables (`__version__`, `__version_tuple__`, `version`, `version_tuple`) with hardcoded values.\n- It uses a conditional block based on `TYPE_CHECKING` to define type hints, which is a common pattern.\n- All variables are assigned static, hardcoded strings and tuples.\n- There are no external data inputs, network calls, dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.\n- The code is straightforward and typical for version management in Python packages.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the presence of issues:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  No. The code is standard version info setup with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes in the report's reasoning:\n- **Are there any errors?**  \n  The reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. They focus on the absence of external data handling, suspicious constructs, or dynamic behavior, which is accurate.\n\n### Scores and their justification:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. No malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0, which is justified given the static, benign nature of the code.\n\n### Critical points:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code's purpose is solely to define version metadata, a common pattern with no security concerns.\n- No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; the analysis correctly states that the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**Overall, the reports are accurate and well-justified.** There is no indication of malicious intent or security risk.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard, benign version declaration snippet with no security issues. The reports correctly reflect this.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, and the provided scores are appropriate. No further action needed.",
