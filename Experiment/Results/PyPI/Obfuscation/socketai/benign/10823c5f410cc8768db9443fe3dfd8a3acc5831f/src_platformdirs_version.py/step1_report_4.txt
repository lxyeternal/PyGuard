  "purpose": "Define version information and type annotations for the package.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and tuple representations to variables.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no data flow to untrusted sources or output.",
  "flows": "Assignment statements setting version info from hardcoded strings.",
  "anomalies": "Use of TYPE_CHECKING condition is standard; no suspicious code or backdoors. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets version-related variables, with conditional type annotations. It uses standard Python conventions for package versioning and type hinting, without any dynamic code execution, input/output handling, or external data interactions. No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are present. The structure is straightforward and typical for version management in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version declaration block with no malicious intent or security issues. It simply defines version variables for the package, with no suspicious or malicious code detected.",
