  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - The code is a straightforward version declaration snippet, assigning static version strings and tuples.\n   - It includes a conditional block for type checking (`TYPE_CHECKING`) to define type hints, which is standard practice.\n   - There are no dynamic elements, external data sources, user inputs, or network calls.\n   - The version information is hardcoded as `'4.3.7'` and `(4, 3, 7)`.\n\n2. **Security & Malicious Behavior:**\n   - The code does not perform any I/O, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No obfuscation, backdoors, or hidden malicious logic are present.\n   - The conditional `TYPE_CHECKING` block is common for type hinting and does not introduce any security risk.\n   - The variables are assigned static data, with no indication of malicious intent.\n\n3. **Analysis of Each Report:**\n   - All five reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious or suspicious behavior.\n   - They assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, correctly reflecting the straightforward nature of the code.\n   - The security risk score is 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of external interactions.\n\n4. **Scores & Justifications:**\n   - The scores assigned in all reports are consistent and reasonable.\n   - Given the static, well-understood pattern, there's no reason to elevate the malware or risk scores.\n   - The confidence level of 1 is justified, as the analysis is straightforward and conclusive.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a typical version declaration snippet with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. All reports are accurate in their assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n\n- **Maintain the current scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.\n- **No changes needed.**\n\nThis code is safe, standard, and poses no supply chain risk.",
