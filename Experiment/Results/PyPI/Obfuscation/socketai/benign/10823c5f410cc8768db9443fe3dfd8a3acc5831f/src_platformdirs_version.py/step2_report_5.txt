  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code is a straightforward version declaration snippet, assigning static version strings and tuples.\n   - No untrusted data sources, dynamic code execution, or external data handling is present.\n   - The conditional `TYPE_CHECKING` block is standard for type hints and does not introduce any malicious behavior.\n   - No obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious constructs are detected.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n   - The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, which aligns with the actual static nature of the code.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is typical for version management, with no malicious intent.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign `malware` and `securityRisk` scores of 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - The `obfuscated` score is 0, which is correct.\n   - The confidence score is 1, justified by the straightforward and well-understood nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments seem necessary here.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is static, with no dynamic or external inputs, and no malicious constructs, a high risk score isn't justified.\n   - The assigned scores of 0 for malware and security risk are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, nor does it contain obfuscated or hidden code.\n   - The malware score of 0 is correct.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they recognize the code as benign boilerplate.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- The code is a standard version declaration snippet with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n- There is no evidence of supply chain risk, malware, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is benign, straightforward, and typical for version management in Python packages. The reports correctly identify this and assign appropriate scores. No changes are necessary.",
