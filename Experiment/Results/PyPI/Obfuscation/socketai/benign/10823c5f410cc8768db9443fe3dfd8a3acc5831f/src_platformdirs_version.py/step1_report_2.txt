  "purpose": "Define version information variables for a Python package/module.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting version strings and tuples, type checking condition.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, user input, or external data sources present.",
  "flows": "None; static assignment of version variables, no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; the code is straightforward version info definition.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up version-related constants with support for type checking. It assigns static version strings and tuples without any input or external data interaction. The conditional import for type annotations does not introduce any malicious behavior. There are no obfuscated patterns, dynamic execution, or hidden backdoors. Overall, the code appears purely for version information storage with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard version declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and serves its purpose of version management.",
