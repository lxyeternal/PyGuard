  "purpose": "Defines version information variables for a Python package, including static version strings and tuples, with type hinting support.",
  "sources": "Assignment of static version strings and tuples, conditional type checking block for type hints.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static assignments with no external data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static data assignments only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version declaration code with standard type hinting pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static version info module assigning version strings and tuples. It includes a standard type-checking conditional for type hints, which is common practice. There are no dynamic elements, external inputs, network calls, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs. All variables are assigned fixed, hardcoded values. The code does not perform any operations that could be malicious, nor does it contain any obfuscation or hidden malicious logic. The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with malware, obfuscation, and risk scores all set to zero, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity and purpose. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), as the code is straightforward and well-understood.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version declaration snippet with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. All reports' assessments are accurate and justified. The current scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are correct and should be maintained.",
