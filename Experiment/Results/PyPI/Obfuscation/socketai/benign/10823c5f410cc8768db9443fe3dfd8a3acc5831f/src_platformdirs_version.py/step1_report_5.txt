  "purpose": "Define version information for a Python package, including version strings and tuples.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements for version strings and version tuple values.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "Initialization of version variables to hardcoded strings and tuples.",
  "anomalies": "Use of TYPE_CHECKING for type hints; no actual malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up version metadata with hardcoded strings and tuples. It includes a conditional import block for type hints, which is standard practice. No external data sources, user inputs, or untrusted data handling is present. The version information is statically assigned, and there are no obfuscated or suspicious constructs. The structure is typical for version management in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version definition module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely manages static version data and type annotations.",
