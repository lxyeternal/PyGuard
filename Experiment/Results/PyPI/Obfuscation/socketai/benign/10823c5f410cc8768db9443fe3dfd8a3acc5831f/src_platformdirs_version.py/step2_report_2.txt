  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code snippets are straightforward, static assignments of version strings and tuples.\n- They include standard type-checking conditional blocks, which are common in Python version modules.\n- No external inputs, network calls, or dynamic behaviors are present.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious constructs are evident.\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign and standard.\n\n**Specific review of scores:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's nature—no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's clarity.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is reasonable since the code is static and does not introduce security risks.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n- The reasoning is sound: static version info, no external data, no suspicious logic.\n- The confidence level is 1 across all, which seems justified.\n\n**Challenging assumptions:**\n\n- No claims of vulnerabilities or malicious intent are made; all are cautious and accurate.\n- The code's simplicity precludes any hidden risks or obfuscation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The scores are appropriate and justified.\n- The code is a typical version declaration pattern with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk detected)\n\nThe code is standard boilerplate for version management in Python packages, with no signs of supply chain risk or malicious intent.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The current scores are accurate and should remain as is.",
