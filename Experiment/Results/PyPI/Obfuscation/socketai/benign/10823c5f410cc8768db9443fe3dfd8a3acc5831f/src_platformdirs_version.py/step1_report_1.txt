  "purpose": "Define version information and type checking configuration for a Python package.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting version strings and tuples.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "N/A - simple variable assignments, no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets version-related variables, with conditional type hinting. The version information is hardcoded, which is common and not malicious. There are no dynamic or untrusted data inputs, no network calls, and no obfuscation or malicious logic present. The structure is straightforward and typical for version declaration modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version declaration snippet with no signs of malicious intent, supply chain risk, or obfuscation. It merely assigns static version info to variables.",
