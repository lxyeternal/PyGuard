  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code is a straightforward version declaration module.\n   - It assigns static version strings and tuples.\n   - It includes a conditional block for type hinting, which is standard.\n   - There are no dynamic inputs, external data sources, network calls, or obfuscation.\n   - No suspicious or malicious constructs are present.\n   - The variables are hardcoded, typical for version info.\n\n2. **Logical and Security Evaluation:**\n   - The code does not perform any operations that could be malicious.\n   - No backdoors, obfuscation, or data exfiltration mechanisms.\n   - No untrusted data handling or external dependencies involved.\n   - The use of `TYPE_CHECKING` is standard for type hints.\n\n3. **Scores Assessment:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is reasonable since the code doesn't introduce any security vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **Any Discrepancies or Concerns?**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities that aren't supported by the code.\n   - The code's purpose is purely for version info, with no hidden malicious intent.\n\n5. **Final Justification:**\n   - The code is a typical version management snippet.\n   - It does not contain any malicious, obfuscated, or risky elements.\n   - The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**My independent estimate aligns with the reports: all scores should be zero.** The code is safe, non-malicious, and standard practice for version declaration.",
