  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated utility for managing system paths on macOS. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or supply chain sabotage. The obfuscation and custom attribute usage warrant cautious review in a broader context, but based solely on this snippet, the supply chain risk is low."
