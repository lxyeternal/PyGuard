  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of Android environment utility functions designed to retrieve storage paths. There is no evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious activity. Obfuscation is present but appears to be for concealment rather than malicious purposes. The security risk is low, and the malware score is zero. The obfuscation score is justified at approximately 0.75 due to variable naming complexity. Overall, the code poses minimal supply chain security concern."
