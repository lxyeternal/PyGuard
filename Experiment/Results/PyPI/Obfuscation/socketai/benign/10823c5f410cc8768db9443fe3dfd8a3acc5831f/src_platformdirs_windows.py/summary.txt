  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Windows system utility for retrieving special folder paths, employing obfuscation and dynamic loading typical of cross-platform or environment-aware scripts. No malicious activity or supply chain compromise is evident. The malware score should be set to 0, the obfuscation level is moderate (~0.4), and the overall security risk is low (~0.2)."
