  "conclusion": "The code functions as a platform-specific directory utility with high obfuscation. No direct malicious activity or payloads are present in this fragment. The obfuscation, however, is suspicious and warrants further review of the entire package. The malware score is low (~0.2), obfuscation high (~0.8), and overall security risk moderate (~0.4). Continuous monitoring and comprehensive code review are recommended before deploying or trusting this dependency."
