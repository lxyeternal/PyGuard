  "conclusion": "The code is a benign testing utility for ChromeDriver version management. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads are detected. Obfuscation appears to be for code concealment but does not imply malicious intent. The overall security risk is low, and the code aligns with typical testing practices."
