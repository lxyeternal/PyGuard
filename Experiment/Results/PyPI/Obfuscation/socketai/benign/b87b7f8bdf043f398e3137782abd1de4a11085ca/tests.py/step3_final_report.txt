  "purpose": "The code manages ChromeDriver versions for testing purposes, performing uninstall, install, and version verification operations via subprocess calls, filesystem checks, and environment variables.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables ('VIRTUAL_ENV'), filesystem paths (driver executable), and subprocess outputs (version checks).",
  "sinks": "Executes system commands for uninstalling, installing, and verifying ChromeDriver; deletes files; reads subprocess outputs for assertions.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (environment variables, filesystem, subprocess outputs) flow into subprocess commands and file operations, with outputs used for assertions and version validation.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are heavily obfuscated but no malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious payloads are present. Dummy checksum values suggest test data. No suspicious network activity or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment cleanup, driver installation, and version verification typical in testing frameworks. It uses subprocess calls to manage ChromeDriver versions, deletes driver files, and checks version outputs. Obfuscation of variable names is present but not indicative of malicious intent. Checksums are dummy placeholders, consistent with test environments. No hardcoded credentials, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior are observed. The code's operations are standard for test setup and validation, with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign testing utility for ChromeDriver version management. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads are detected. Obfuscation appears to be for code concealment but does not imply malicious intent. The overall security risk is low, and the code aligns with typical testing practices.",
