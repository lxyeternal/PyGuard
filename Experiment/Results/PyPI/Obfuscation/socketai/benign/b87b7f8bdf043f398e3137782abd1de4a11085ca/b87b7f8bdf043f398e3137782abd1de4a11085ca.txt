      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup utility for ChromeDriver, with moderate obfuscation and dynamic URL handling. No malware or malicious behavior is detected. The low malware score (0.05) and low security risk (0.2) are justified given the behavior and context. Vigilance should be maintained regarding the trustworthiness of external sources, but based on this code, the supply chain risk appears minimal."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign testing utility for ChromeDriver version management. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads are detected. Obfuscation appears to be for code concealment but does not imply malicious intent. The overall security risk is low, and the code aligns with typical testing practices."
