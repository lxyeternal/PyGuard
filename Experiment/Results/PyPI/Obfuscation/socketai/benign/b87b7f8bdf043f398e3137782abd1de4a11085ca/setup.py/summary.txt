  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup utility for ChromeDriver, with moderate obfuscation and dynamic URL handling. No malware or malicious behavior is detected. The low malware score (0.05) and low security risk (0.2) are justified given the behavior and context. Vigilance should be maintained regarding the trustworthiness of external sources, but based on this code, the supply chain risk appears minimal."
