  "purpose": "Automates downloading, verifying, and extracting ChromeDriver binaries based on remote version info, platform detection, and checksum validation.",
  "sources": "Remote URL fetching for latest version info, URL construction for binary download, checksum verification, file extraction.",
  "sinks": "File download and extraction, checksum validation, network requests to external sources.",
  "flows": "Fetch version info from URL -> construct download URL -> download ZIP file -> verify checksum -> extract files.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obscure variable names, dynamic URL assembly, placeholder script entries ('if', 'empty'), reliance on external URLs without signature validation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup tasks for ChromeDriver: fetching latest version info, constructing download URLs based on platform, downloading ZIP files, verifying MD5 checksums, and extracting contents. Variable naming is intentionally obscure, which may suggest obfuscation but is common in build scripts. No hardcoded credentials, malicious commands, or signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection are present. The checksum verification relies on external variables, which could be incomplete, but the process itself is standard. External URLs are legitimate sources (Google sites), and no malicious network activity is evident. Overall, the script functions as a typical installer with some obfuscation but no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup utility for ChromeDriver, with moderate obfuscation and dynamic URL handling. No malware or malicious behavior is detected. The low malware score (0.05) and low security risk (0.2) are justified given the behavior and context. Vigilance should be maintained regarding the trustworthiness of external sources, but based on this code, the supply chain risk appears minimal.",
