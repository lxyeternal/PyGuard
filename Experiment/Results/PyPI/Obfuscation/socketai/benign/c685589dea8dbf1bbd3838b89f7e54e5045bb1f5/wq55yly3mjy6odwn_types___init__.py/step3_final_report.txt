  "purpose": "Define the public API symbols for the module via __all__ list.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it is a static list assignment.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or external data handling are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is static.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple list assignment to __all__, a common Python pattern for defining module exports. It contains only static strings with no logic, data processing, or external interactions. All reports agree on its benign nature, and no malicious or security issues are evident. The JSON reports mention a 'JSON parse error,' but this appears to be a formatting artifact, not an actual problem. The scores assigned (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Python module export list with no malicious or security concerns. All reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No further action needed.",
