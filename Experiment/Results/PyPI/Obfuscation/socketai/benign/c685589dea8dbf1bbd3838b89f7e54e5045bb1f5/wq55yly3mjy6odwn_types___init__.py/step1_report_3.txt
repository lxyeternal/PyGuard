{
  "purpose": "Defines an exported list of module components, likely indicating the public API of the module.",
  "sources": "None explicitly present; no input or data reading operations are shown.",
  "sinks": "No sink points; no untrusted data handling or output operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only assigns a list to __all__.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only exporting identifiers; no suspicious or unusual patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code simply declares a list of strings indicating exported module components. It does not contain any logic, data input, or output, nor does it invoke external processes or handle sensitive information. There are no signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior. The snippet appears to be standard Python module export syntax.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward declaration of module exports with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is likely part of a larger module's __init__.py or similar file. Overall, there are no security concerns here.",
