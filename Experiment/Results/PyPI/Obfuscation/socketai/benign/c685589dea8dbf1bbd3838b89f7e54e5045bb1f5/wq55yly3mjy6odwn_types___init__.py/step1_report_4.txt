  "anomalies": "Minimal code, only a list of strings assigned to a variable, no suspicious or unusual patterns present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a list named __all__ with three string elements. This pattern is typical for specifying public API exports in Python modules. No dynamic code, data processing, or external interactions are present. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security issues within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward module export list with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
