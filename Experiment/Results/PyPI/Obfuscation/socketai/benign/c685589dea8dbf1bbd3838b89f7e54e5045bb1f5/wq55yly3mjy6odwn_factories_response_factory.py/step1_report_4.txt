{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for handling HTTP-like responses, likely intended for subclassing and implementation of specific behavior.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; only class and method definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code is purely structural with an abstract method declaration.",
  "anomalies": "Class and method names are intentionally obfuscated, which could be suspicious; however, obfuscation alone is not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class with a single abstract method that takes parameters resembling HTTP response components (status_code, reason, headers, body, request). There is no implementation, no data handling, and no external interactions. The obfuscated naming might suggest an attempt to hide intent but could also be for code protection or obfuscation. No malicious patterns such as network operations, data exfiltration, or code execution are present. The code appears to be a structural part of a larger framework, not malicious by itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a non-malicious abstract class definition with obfuscated naming. It does not exhibit malware behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
