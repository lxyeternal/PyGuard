  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class with an abstract method for handling HTTP-like response details.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; class and method definitions only.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no data handling or output operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code only defines an interface.",
  "anomalies": "The class and method names appear obfuscated and do not convey meaningful intent; no actual logic implemented.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class inheriting from ABC with a single abstract method that accepts parameters resembling HTTP response components. The class and method names are intentionally obfuscated, which could suggest an attempt to hide purpose. There are no executable statements, data handling, or external calls that could indicate malicious activity. The lack of implementation or logic means no malicious behavior is detectable. The structure indicates an interface or placeholder, possibly part of a larger codebase.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a non-functional placeholder with obfuscated naming, likely intended for defining an interface. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues based solely on this fragment.",
