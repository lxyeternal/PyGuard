  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class with an abstract method related to handling HTTP response data.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data sources are present in this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows as the code only defines a class and an abstract method without implementation.",
  "anomalies": "The class and method names appear obfuscated and do not convey meaningful purpose; however, obfuscation alone is not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class inheriting from ABC, with a single abstract method that accepts typical HTTP response parameters. The naming appears intentionally obfuscated, which could suggest an attempt to hide intent, but no malicious behavior is evident. The code is purely structural and does not perform any actions, data handling, or external interactions. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, such as network activity, data leaks, or obfuscation techniques beyond name mangling, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, obfuscated structural class definition without any malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation is likely intended to conceal purpose but does not itself indicate malicious intent.",
