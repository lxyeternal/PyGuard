  "purpose": "Define an abstract class for handling HTTP responses with obfuscated class and method names.",
  "sources": "Parameters of the abstract method: status_code, reason, headers, body, request.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external interactions are present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow beyond class and method declaration; no runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names; absence of implementation; purely structural code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a syntactically correct abstract class with a single abstract method, using obfuscated identifiers. It contains no logic, data handling, or external interactions. All reviews recognize the obfuscation but correctly conclude that there is no malicious activity or security vulnerability. Malware scores are appropriately zero; obfuscation scores are high but justified; security risk scores are low, reflecting the non-executing, structural nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated interface definition with no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues. The obfuscation appears superficial and does not imply malicious intent. The assigned scores are consistent with the analysis, and no modifications are necessary.",
