      "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated setup script with no active malicious activity detected. The high obfuscation and malformed setup parameters are red flags that warrant further review, but based solely on this snippet, it appears benign. The overall security risk is low but should be monitored, especially if more code or network activity is observed in related components."

The high obfuscation score is justified but does not indicate malicious intent. The malware score remains at 0, and the security risk is minimal. Continued monitoring is recommended if further suspicious code appears, but based on this fragment, it poses no threat."
