  "purpose": "Define the public API symbols for the module via the __all__ list.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only assigns a list to __all__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code is static.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward declaration of __all__, listing four strings: 'client', 'factories', 'types', and 'logger'. It serves as a module API indicator with no data processing, network activity, or security-sensitive operations. All reports agree on its benign nature, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned—malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0—are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No logical errors or vulnerabilities are identified. The code's purpose is purely declarative, and it poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a standard module export declaration with no malicious intent or security concerns. The assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
