  "purpose": "Defines the list of public symbols to be exported when the module is imported, likely part of a package's __init__.py.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading observed in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leakage points present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths present in this code.",
  "anomalies": "Code simply declares an export list; no unusual or suspicious activity detected.",
  "analysis": "This is a minimal code snippet that sets the __all__ variable to specify exported symbols for a Python module or package. It does not contain any executable logic, data processing, or external input/output operations. The code appears to be a standard practice for package organization, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module export declaration with no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
