  "purpose": "The code defines the __all__ variable for module exports, listing 'client', 'factories', 'types', and 'logger'.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations are present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling points are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code simply defines a list of exported symbols.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears minimal, containing only a module export list. No suspicious or unusual code patterns are observed.",
  "analysis": "This snippet only defines the __all__ variable for controlling module exports. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or system modification. The absence of function calls, data handling, or imported modules indicates no immediate security concerns. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module export declaration with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears benign and serves a straightforward purpose.",
