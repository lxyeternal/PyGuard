  "purpose": "Declare the public API of the module by specifying 'response_factory' as an exported symbol.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data sources; static assignment of __all__ variable.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows or external interactions.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code is a simple static assignment with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is minimal and straightforward, with no dynamic or suspicious elements.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a list containing 'response_factory' to the __all__ variable, which controls module exports. It contains no dynamic code, no external calls, no input/output, and no security-sensitive operations. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and transparency.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Python module declaration with no malicious intent or security issues. All assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate. No further action or concern is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
