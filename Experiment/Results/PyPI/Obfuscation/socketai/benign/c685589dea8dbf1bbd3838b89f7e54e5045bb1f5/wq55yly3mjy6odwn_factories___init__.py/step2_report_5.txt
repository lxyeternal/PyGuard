  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content & Behavior**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment of a list containing `'response_factory'` to the `__all__` variable.\n   - There are no inputs, data processing, dynamic code execution, or external interactions.\n   - The code is a standard Python practice for defining module exports.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**:\n   - None of the reports identify any anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious behavior.\n   - The code is minimal, straightforward, and typical of a module defining its public API.\n\n3. **Error, Flaws, or Mistakes**:\n   - No logical errors or flaws are evident.\n   - The reports are consistent in their conclusion that this is benign.\n\n4. **Scores & Reasoning**:\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - Security risk scores are also 0, which is appropriate.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n   - Confidence scores are 1, reflecting high certainty that the code is benign.\n\n5. **Potential Risks & Assumptions**:\n   - The reports correctly challenge any assumptions that this minimal code could be malicious.\n   - Given the simplicity, there's no basis for higher risk scores.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment**:\n   - The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent.\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\n**Conclusion**:\nAll reports are accurate. The code snippet is a standard, safe module declaration with no security concerns.",
