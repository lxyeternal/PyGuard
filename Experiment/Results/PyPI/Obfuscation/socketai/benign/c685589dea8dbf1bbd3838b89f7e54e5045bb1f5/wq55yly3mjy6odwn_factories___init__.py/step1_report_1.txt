  "purpose": "Define a module attribute __all__ to specify exported names, here only 'response_factory'.",
  "sources": "Module attribute assignment",
  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; only a simple __all__ declaration with no additional code",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a list with a single string 'response_factory' to the __all__ variable, which controls what is exported when the module is imported. There are no inputs, no data processing, and no dynamic code execution present. The snippet appears to be a standard Python practice for controlling namespace exports, with no suspicious or malicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign declaration used for module exports. There are no signs of malware, malicious activity, or security risks.",
