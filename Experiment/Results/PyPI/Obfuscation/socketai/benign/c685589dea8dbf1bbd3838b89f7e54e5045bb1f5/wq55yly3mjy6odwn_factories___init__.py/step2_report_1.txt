  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Actual Presence of Issues**  \nAll reports describe the same minimal code snippet:  \n```python\n__all__ = ['response_factory']\n```  \nThis code simply declares a module attribute that controls what is exported when the module is imported. There are no other operations, no dynamic code, no data processing, and no external interactions. Based on the provided code, **there are no issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors present**.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that this is a benign, standard practice in Python modules. No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**  \n- **Obfuscated Score (0)**: Correct, as the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.  \n- **Malware Score (0)**: Correct, since there's no malicious activity or code.  \n- **Security Risk Score (0)**: Correct, no security issues are present.  \n- **Confidence (1)**: Appropriately high, given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores**  \nSince all assessments agree that the code is benign, there is no justification for raising the malware or security risk scores. The risk is effectively zero.\n\n5. **Potential Assumptions or Claims about Vulnerabilities**  \nAll reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state that the code is a simple API declaration with no suspicious features.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Report Content**  \nScores are consistent with the code and the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0  \n\nThis code snippet is a standard, benign module attribute declaration with no malicious or security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe reports are accurate and reasonable. No modifications to the scores are necessary. The code is straightforward, and there are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
