{
  "purpose": "Define the __all__ list for module exports, indicating that only response_factory is publicly accessible.",
  "sources": "No data input sources present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points that handle untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths since the code only declares a list.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code structure; only a list declaration with a single string element. No suspicious or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code simply declares the __all__ variable to specify module exports. It contains a list with a single string, 'response_factory', which suggests that this module exposes this component. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscated code, or security risks. The code is minimal and typical of Python modules defining public API components.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security issues.",
