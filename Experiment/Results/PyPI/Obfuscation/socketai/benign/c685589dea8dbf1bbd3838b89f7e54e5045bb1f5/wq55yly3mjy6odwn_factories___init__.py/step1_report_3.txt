{
  "purpose": "Define an exported module attribute '__all__' listing 'response_factory', likely to control public API exposure.",
  "sources": "None; no input or data reading in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or output in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; only a module attribute definition. No suspicious or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a single assignment to the '__all__' variable, which specifies the public API of the module. There are no data inputs, no code execution, and no external interactions. This is a standard practice in Python modules to define exportable symbols. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard Python module attribute declaration with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
