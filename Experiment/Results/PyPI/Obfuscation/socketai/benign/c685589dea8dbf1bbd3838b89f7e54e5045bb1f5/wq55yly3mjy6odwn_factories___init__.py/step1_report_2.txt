  "anomalies": "Empty list with a single string element; no unusual or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an assignment to the special variable __all__, which is used to declare the public API of the module. It contains only one string 'response_factory'. There are no input sources, data processing, external calls, or potentially dangerous operations present. The code appears to be a simple module export declaration with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
