  "purpose": "The code appears to define a module's public interface by listing 'response_factory' as an exported symbol.",
  "sources": "No data input sources are present in this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "There are no sink points where untrusted data could cause leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows are identifiable in this minimal code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The code is extremely minimal and straightforward; no unusual or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "This code simply declares an '__all__' list with a single string, indicating that 'response_factory' is intended to be a publicly accessible object from this module. There are no imports, no data processing, no dynamic code execution, and no embedded credentials or hidden code. The minimal structure reduces the likelihood of malicious intent or obfuscation. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python module declaration of its public interface with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
