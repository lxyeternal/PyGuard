  "purpose": "This code defines the `__all__` list to specify the public interface of a module, exposing 'api_logger' and 'logger'.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code only declares an exported list.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks occurs; the code only sets a module attribute.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no unusual or suspicious patterns. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet only declares the `__all__` list with two string elements, indicating the public API of the module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. The simplicity suggests it's standard practice for controlling module exports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only to define exported symbols for the module. No malicious intent or security risks are identified.",
