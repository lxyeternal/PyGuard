  "purpose": "The code defines an export list for module symbols, specifically 'api_logger' and 'logger'.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing points are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths are evident in this code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and only declares an exported list; no anomalies or suspicious behavior are observed.",
  "analysis": "This is a straightforward declaration of __all__, a common Python practice to specify module exports. There are no embedded or hidden behaviors, no external input handling, nor any suspicious code. The code snippet is too minimal to suggest malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only to specify module exports. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security threats in this fragment.",
