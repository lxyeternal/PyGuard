  "purpose": "Declaration of the module's public API via __all__ list containing 'api_logger' and 'logger'.",
  "sources": "None; static list declaration with string literals.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow, input, or output operations.",
  "flows": "None; no source-to-sink data flow as the code is static.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward, standard practice without obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static declaration of __all__, which specifies exported symbols. No functions, data processing, or external interactions are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are consistent and appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python module export declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications are necessary.",
