{
  "purpose": "Defines an HTTP method mapping class with utility functions to retrieve method names by value or name.",
  "sources": "Class variables holding HTTP method strings, and class methods accessing these variables.",
  "sinks": "The class methods use 'vars(cls)' and 'getattr', which could potentially be manipulated if the class were extended or misused, but currently do not lead to untrusted data flows.",
  "flows": "Input values for class methods originate from external calls; methods retrieve corresponding class variable or attribute based on input.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. The methods are straightforward and do not perform any malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with string constants representing HTTP methods. The first method searches the class variables for a value match and returns the matching key. The second method returns the class attribute corresponding to an uppercase version of the input string, defaulting to None if not found. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious data flows. The code appears to be a simple utility for mapping HTTP methods.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility class for mapping HTTP method strings to their respective names. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The functions are straightforward and do not involve any suspicious activity.",
