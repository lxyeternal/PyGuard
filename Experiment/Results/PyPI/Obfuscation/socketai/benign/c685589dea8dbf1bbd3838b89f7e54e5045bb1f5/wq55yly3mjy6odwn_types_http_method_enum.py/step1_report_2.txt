{
  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration-like class for HTTP methods with utility functions to retrieve method names by value and name.",
  "sources": "No external data input; class variables are hardcoded strings representing HTTP methods.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output functions that could lead to data leaks or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "The methods perform lookups within class variables but do not process untrusted data from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic attribute access with 'getattr' is typical but could be misused if combined with untrusted input. The class itself appears benign, serving as an enumeration.",
  "analysis": "The class encapsulates HTTP method strings as class variables. The method 'HSeqwHUeABGvLVNUCpHJyOLmUhdrLBfc' performs a lookup by value, iterating through class variables. The 'edtsQfTjqcrzCrHJazTcPhmOwsnhdYKN' method retrieves attribute based on provided string, converting it to uppercase. Both methods are simple, static lookups with no external data handling or processing. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or malicious intent are evident. No external data sources, network connections, or system modifications are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility class for managing HTTP methods, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It functions as a simple enumeration helper without external dependencies or data handling that could be exploited.",
