  "purpose": "Defines HTTP methods as class variables; provides utility methods for retrieving method names by value or string.",
  "sources": "Class variables containing HTTP method strings.",
  "sinks": "None.",
  "flows": "Lookup functions mapping input values or strings to class variable names or attributes.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and method names intended to conceal purpose; no malicious code or external data flows.",
  "analysis": "The class serves as a utility for HTTP method constants with lookup functions. No external data, network activity, or malicious behaviors are present. Obfuscation appears cosmetic, not malicious. The lookup methods are straightforward, with no signs of data leaks or malicious operations. Malware score is zero; obfuscation is moderate; security risk is minimal.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated utility class for managing HTTP methods. Obfuscation warrants a higher obfuscated score but does not imply malicious intent. No malicious activity or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
