  "purpose": "Defines an HTTP method class with utility functions for retrieving method names by value and name.",
  "sources": "Class variables (HTTP method strings), class methods accessing class variables.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of method names or dynamic attribute access, but no direct data sinks or untrusted input handling evident.",
  "flows": "Input to class methods; method calls that match string values to class variables or get attributes.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names; methods perform straightforward lookups without validation or sanitization; no clear malicious intent, but the obfuscation and naming could hide malicious code if misused. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with class variables representing HTTP methods, all stored as strings. Two class methods are provided: one for retrieving the variable name given a value, and one for getting the class variable based on a string (case-insensitive). The variable names are deliberately obfuscated, but their functions are simple lookups. There are no input validation, no external data sources, and no network activity. The code appears benign, but the obfuscation may conceal malicious intent if this pattern is used elsewhere with malicious logic. Overall, the code's behavior is benign and standard for a constants or enum-like class.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a simple, obfuscated mapping of HTTP methods with utility functions for lookups. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks within this snippet. Its obfuscated variable names could be a concern if part of larger malicious code, but in isolation, it appears benign.",
