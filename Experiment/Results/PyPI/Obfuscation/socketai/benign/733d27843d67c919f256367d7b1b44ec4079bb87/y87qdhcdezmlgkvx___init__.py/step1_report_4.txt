  "purpose": "This source code appears to be a general Python script, likely for data processing or utility functions, but the specific purpose cannot be definitively identified due to lack of context.",
  "sources": "Reads input from command line arguments, environment variables, or possibly external files. Exact sources are not visible in the provided code snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes output to files, console, or network connections. No explicit sinks are identified in the visible code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions, possibly ending at output or storage locations. Specific source-to-sink paths cannot be fully determined without more code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or unusual behaviors are evident. No obfuscated code or misleading variable names observed.",
  "analysis": "The code does not display any overt malicious behavior such as network communication with suspicious domains, data exfiltration, or system tampering. Usage of third-party libraries seems standard. The structure and format are typical for Python scripts. Due to the lack of concrete source or sink definitions in the provided snippet, this review is limited to surface-level observations.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code fragment, there are no clear signs of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears benign, but a more comprehensive review of the full codebase is recommended to rule out hidden issues.",
