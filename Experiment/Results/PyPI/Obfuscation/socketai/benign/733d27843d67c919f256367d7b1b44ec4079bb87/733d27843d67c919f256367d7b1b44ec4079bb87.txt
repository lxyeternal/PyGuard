      "obfuscated": 0.75,
      "confidence": 0.85,
      "conclusion": "Most reports accurately reflect the security posture based on their descriptions. Reports 2 and 5 demonstrate signs of obfuscation and dynamic code execution, warranting higher malware scores (~0.75). Reports 1 and 4 are benign, with scores at zero or minimal. Report 3's lack of code justifies zero scores. Overall, the assessment suggests moderate overall risk (~0.55), with higher concern in reports 2 and 5. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The environment variable controls are standard, and the dotenv library is used appropriately. The scores assigned in the reports—malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: approximately 0.1–0.2—are justified and accurate given the code's straightforward nature."
