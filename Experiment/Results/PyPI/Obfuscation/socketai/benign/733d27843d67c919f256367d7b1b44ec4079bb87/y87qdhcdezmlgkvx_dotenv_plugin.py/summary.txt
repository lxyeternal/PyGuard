  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The environment variable controls are standard, and the dotenv library is used appropriately. The scores assigned in the reports—malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: approximately 0.1–0.2—are justified and accurate given the code's straightforward nature."
