  "purpose": "The code appears to perform some form of data processing or computation, but without specific context or comments, the purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Input is read from the 'input_data' variable and possibly from environment variables (if used).",
  "sinks": "Data is output via print statements and possibly written to files or network connections if present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through processing functions and then to output or storage mechanisms.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns are immediately evident. There are no obfuscated elements or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code reads input data, performs standard processing, and outputs results. No external or untrusted data sources, such as network or environment variables, seem to be misused. No malicious functions like system commands, network connections to suspicious domains, or data exfiltration are detected. The structure appears straightforward with no signs of obfuscation or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit any signs of malicious behavior or supply chain risks based on the provided fragment. It appears to be standard, benign Python code with no suspicious activities.",
