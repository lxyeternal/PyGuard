  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Input data from variables, environment variables, network sockets, and external modules.",
  "sinks": "Output functions (print, file write), network connections, environment variables, and data processing functions.",
  "flows": "Input sources to output sinks through data processing, environment variable access, and network communication.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets described involve standard data input, environment variable reading, and network operations without signs of malicious intent. The absence of suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious functions suggests benign behavior. The security risk is minimal, with potential external interactions considered low risk. The confidence level is high due to the lack of concrete malicious indicators. No anomalies or malicious code structures are present.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided descriptions, the code appears benign with no evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate given the potential for external inputs and network operations but do not indicate malicious intent.",
