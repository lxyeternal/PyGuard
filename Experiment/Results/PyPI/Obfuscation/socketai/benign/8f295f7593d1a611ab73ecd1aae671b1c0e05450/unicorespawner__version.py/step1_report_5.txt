  "purpose": "Assigning a version string to a variable.",
  "sources": "The string assignment itself; no input reading or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data output or external interaction.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The variable name 'mibImnIIpWoQZrnaSqeufGKEgAupTpWF' appears obfuscated or randomly generated; no clear purpose or meaning. The value '1.1.2' is a version string but given the context, the variable name suggests obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single line assigning a version string to a seemingly random variable name. No input, no external calls, no suspicious behavior. The obfuscated variable name could indicate an attempt to hide intent, but without further code, this is speculative. No malicious behavior or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple variable assignment with an obfuscated variable name. There is no malicious behavior or security risk identified based solely on this snippet.",
