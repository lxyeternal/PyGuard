  "purpose": "Assigns the string '1.1.2' to the variable 'mibImnIIpWoQZrnaSqeufGKEgAupTpWF'.",
  "sources": "Assignment statement where the variable 'mibImnIIpWoQZrnaSqeufGKEgAupTpWF' is assigned a string literal.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external outputs; no sinks present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the string literal into the variable 'mibImnIIpWoQZrnaSqeufGKEgAupTpWF'.",
  "anomalies": "The variable name appears obfuscated and nonsensical; no clear purpose or context is provided. The code only involves a simple assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string '1.1.2' to a variable with an obfuscated name. There are no functions, input/output operations, or external interactions. The variable name's obfuscation might suggest an attempt to hide intent, but on its own, this is harmless and common in some obfuscation or code generation contexts. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple variable assignment with an obfuscated variable name. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears benign and likely part of a larger, possibly obfuscated, codebase.",
