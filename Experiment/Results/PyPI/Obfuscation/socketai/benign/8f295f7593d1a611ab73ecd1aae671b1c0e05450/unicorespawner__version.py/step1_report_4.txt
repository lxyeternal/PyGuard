  "purpose": "Assigns a string value '1.1.2' to the variable 'mibImnIIpWoQZrnaSqeufGKEgAupTpWF'.",
  "sources": "Assignment statement setting the value of 'mibImnIIpWoQZrnaSqeufGKEgAupTpWF'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data being output, transmitted, or used in insecure operations.",
  "flows": "Simple assignment; no data flow from external sources to vulnerable sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The variable name appears obfuscated, but the assignment itself is straightforward and harmless. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single line assigning a version string to a variable with an obfuscated name. There is no input/output, network activity, or code execution. The variable name may suggest obfuscation, but it does not inherently indicate malicious intent. The assigned value is a version string, typical in software versioning, and does not pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a simple variable assignment with an obfuscated variable name. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks detected.",
