{
  "purpose": "Assigns a version string '1.1.2' to an obfuscated variable name.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input, environment variables, or data sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; it's a simple assignment.",
  "anomalies": "The variable name is obfuscated, which can be suspicious, but no malicious activity is present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to an obfuscated variable name. No input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution is involved. The obfuscated variable name alone does not indicate malicious intent, especially given the benign value assigned. The consistent scores across multiple reports support that this is a benign, obfuscated variable assignment with no security risks or malware present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, representing a simple version string assignment with obfuscated naming. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation is noted but does not imply malicious intent in this context.",
