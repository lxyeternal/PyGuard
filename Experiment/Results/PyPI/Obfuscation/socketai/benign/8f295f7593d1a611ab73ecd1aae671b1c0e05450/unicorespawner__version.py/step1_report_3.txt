  "purpose": "Assignment of a version string to a variable",
  "sources": "The variable 'mibImnIIpWoQZrnaSqeufGKEgAupTpWF' is assigned a string value '1.1.2'",
  "sinks": "None; the code only involves variable assignment",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; only a static assignment",
  "anomalies": "The variable name appears obfuscated or nonsensical, which can be suspicious, but no malicious activity is evident from this isolated assignment",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single line assigning a version string to a variable with an obfuscated name. There are no input sources, no data being read, nor any sinks such as network or file operations. The obfuscated variable name could suggest hidden intentions, but in isolation, it is not enough to determine malicious intent. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, and no suspicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple variable assignment with an obfuscated variable name. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this fragment. The obfuscated variable name alone does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "confidence": 0.2,
  "obfuscated": 0.3,
