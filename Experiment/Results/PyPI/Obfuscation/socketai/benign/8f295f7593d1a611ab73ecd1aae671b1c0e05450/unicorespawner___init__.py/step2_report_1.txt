  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**Code Summary:**\nThe code snippet only contains three import statements, importing specific members from internal modules (`_version`, `api_notifications`, `spawner`) with obfuscated or non-descriptive names.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code matches the reported code exactly.\n- No malicious behavior, data processing, or external communication is evident.\n- The imported identifiers are obfuscated, which could be suspicious but is not inherently malicious.\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- All reports correctly identify the obfuscation but dismiss it as non-malicious without sufficient context.\n- They assume obfuscation may conceal malicious intent but do not provide evidence.\n- They correctly note the absence of data flows, sinks, or external interactions.\n\n### Scores Review:\n- **Confidence:** Ranges from 0.6 to 0.8; reasonable given the minimal code and obfuscation.\n- **Obfuscated:** High (0.6 to 0.8); appropriate.\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports; consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Security Risk:** Low (0 to 0.2); aligns with the analysis.\n\n### Specific Observations:\n- The reports uniformly conclude benign intent based solely on import statements, which is reasonable.\n- The concern about obfuscation is valid but not enough to elevate risk scores without further context.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Remain at 0, as there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Could be slightly adjusted, but current levels seem appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** Should stay low unless additional context suggests otherwise.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.7 (average of the reports)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (consistent with low suspicion)\n\n**Overall,** the code appears benign, with obfuscation being the only noteworthy aspect, which alone does not indicate malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are consistent and reasonable. No changes are necessary. The code is a standard set of internal imports with obfuscated identifiers, which warrants caution but not alarm. Further context from the imported modules would be needed to reassess potential risks.",
