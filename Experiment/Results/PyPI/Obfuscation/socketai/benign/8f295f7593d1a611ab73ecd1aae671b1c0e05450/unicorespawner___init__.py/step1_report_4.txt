  "purpose": "Import specific components from local modules within the package",
  "sources": "Import statements for internal modules (_version, api_notifications, spawner)",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or perform actions based on untrusted input",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; only internal module imports",
  "anomalies": "Use of non-descriptive, obfuscated-looking identifiers for imported components; no clear naming conventions",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from internal modules, with identifiers that appear obfuscated or randomly generated. These imports do not involve any external inputs, network communication, or data processing. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The obfuscated identifiers may suggest code obfuscation or intentional concealment, but within the context of local module imports, this does not indicate malicious intent. No suspicious behaviors or anomalies are evident beyond potential obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple set of import statements using obfuscated identifiers. No malicious behavior or security risks are apparent. The primary concern is the obfuscation of identifiers, which may hinder readability but does not inherently indicate malicious intent.",
