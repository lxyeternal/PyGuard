{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific functions or variables from internal modules, likely to be used elsewhere in the package.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules: ._version, .api_notifications, and .spawner.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data handling, network communication, or external system access are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only performs static imports.",
  "anomalies": "Imported identifiers are obfuscated, consisting of random strings, which is unusual but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports obfuscated names from internal modules. The obfuscated naming could suggest attempts at hiding intent or could be an internal naming scheme. There is no evidence of data leaks, network activity, or malicious operations. The code is minimal and only performs static imports without side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard import statements with obfuscated identifiers. There is no indication of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based solely on these import statements.",
