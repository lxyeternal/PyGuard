  "purpose": "Internal module imports with obfuscated member names, likely for internal use or obfuscation purposes.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from internal modules (_version, api_notifications, spawner).",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows; no external communication or data processing observed.",
  "flows": "None; static imports without dynamic data or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated member names, which could be suspicious but are not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static internal imports with obfuscated identifiers. No evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or external communication is present. The obfuscation may be for internal reasons or code concealment but does not indicate malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the obfuscation but reasonably conclude benign intent due to lack of malicious indicators. Malware scores are appropriately zero; obfuscation scores are high, reflecting the naming pattern; security risk scores are low, consistent with the minimal code. Further context about the imported modules would be necessary for a definitive assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with obfuscation being the only noteworthy aspect, which alone does not suggest malicious behavior. The scores are justified and consistent with the analysis. No changes are necessary based on this snippet.",
