  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Code snippet:**\n```python\nfrom ._version import mibImnIIpWoQZrnaSqeufGKEgAupTpWF\nfrom .api_notifications import ckmDHTDHfswjouogQXnAJBewCrKRTkxF\nfrom .spawner import CbQNbbHfNeaUXtYGSJmifZZVFYkujgCe\n```\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Observations:\n- The code consists solely of static import statements from internal modules.\n- The imported members have obfuscated, non-descriptive names, which could be a sign of code obfuscation or internal naming conventions.\n- There are no sinks, data flows, or dynamic behaviors evident.\n- No evidence of malicious operations such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code execution.\n- The minimal snippet limits the ability to determine malicious intent definitively.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; imports from internal modules.\n- **Anomalies:** Obfuscated names are noted as suspicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly states that no malicious behavior is evident, but obfuscation warrants caution.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0.2, Obfuscated: 0.7, Confidence: 0.6\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable. Obfuscation is noted but not considered malicious here.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- Similar to Report 1, with slightly higher confidence.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0.2, Obfuscated: 0.6, Confidence: 0.7\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate. No malicious activity identified.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- Slightly higher confidence, obfuscation score also higher.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0, Obfuscated: 0.8, Confidence: 0.8\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No evidence of malicious activity.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- Similar reasoning, with high obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0.2, Obfuscated: 0.8, Confidence: 0.7\n- **Assessment:** Valid. No malicious behavior detected.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- Slightly lower obfuscation score, consistent reasoning.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0, Obfuscated: 0.7, Confidence: 0.7\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- All reports agree that the code is benign based on the snippet.\n- The obfuscation scores are high, which is reasonable given the naming.\n- Malware scores are consistently zero, aligning with the lack of malicious evidence.\n- Security risks are minimal, as the code only performs static imports.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- The high obfuscation scores reflect suspicion but do not imply malicious intent.\n- The risk scores are appropriately low, given the context.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** approximately 0.7 (consistent with obfuscated identifiers)\n- **Risk score:** around 0.2 (low, given no malicious behavior but potential for concealment)\n\n**Overall, the reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No adjustments are necessary unless further context reveals malicious behavior.**",
