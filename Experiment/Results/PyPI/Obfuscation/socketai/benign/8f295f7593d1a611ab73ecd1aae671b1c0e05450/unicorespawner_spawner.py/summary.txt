  "conclusion": "The code does not contain explicit malware signatures or payloads but exhibits significant obfuscation and dynamic behavior that could be exploited if user inputs are malicious. The primary security concern is injection vulnerability via unsanitized string replacements and execution of unvalidated callables. Scores are assigned conservatively: malware at 0.1, obfuscation at 0.6, and security risk at 0.4, reflecting potential misuse without active malicious activity."
