      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with significant obfuscation and a hardcoded license key. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security compromise. The obfuscation warrants caution, but overall, the security risk is low. The malware score remains at 0, and the obfuscation score is high (~0.75), reflecting the variable naming. The security risk score is low (~0.2), considering the lack of active malicious behavior."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion due to embedded cryptographic secrets, obfuscation, and persistent operation, aligning with characteristics of malicious or covert supply chain components. The overall malware likelihood is high, and the security risk is significant, warranting caution and further analysis."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe pattern for namespace packages in Python with no malicious or security concerns. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, which are appropriate given the code's simplicity and purpose."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code contains embedded cryptographic secrets and demonstrates complex, obfuscated testing behavior. While no active malicious activity is observed, the presence of sensitive secrets and manipulative code indicates a high potential for misuse if exploited. The overall security risk is elevated, and the malware score should be considered moderate to high, primarily due to embedded secrets and obfuscation. It is recommended to treat this code with caution in supply chain contexts and avoid deploying embedded secrets outside secure testing environments."

      "security_risk": 0.2,
      "obfuscated": 0.2,
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for certificate creation with minor security considerations related to input validation. No evidence of malicious activity or backdoors is detected. The obfuscation is minimal but present, and the main security concern is the lack of input sanitization for subprocess calls, which could be exploited in untrusted environments. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."

      "conclusion": "This module functions as cryptographic utility code with obfuscation and low-level system resource management. While no malware signatures are present, the obfuscation and subprocess handling of untrusted data pose security risks. The code warrants cautious review but does not currently exhibit malicious activity."

The malware score is 0, the obfuscation is high (0.8), and the overall security risk is moderate (0.3)."
