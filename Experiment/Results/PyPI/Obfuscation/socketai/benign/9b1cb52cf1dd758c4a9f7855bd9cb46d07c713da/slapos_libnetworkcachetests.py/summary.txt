  "conclusion": "The code contains embedded cryptographic secrets and demonstrates complex, obfuscated testing behavior. While no active malicious activity is observed, the presence of sensitive secrets and manipulative code indicates a high potential for misuse if exploited. The overall security risk is elevated, and the malware score should be considered moderate to high, primarily due to embedded secrets and obfuscation. It is recommended to treat this code with caution in supply chain contexts and avoid deploying embedded secrets outside secure testing environments."
