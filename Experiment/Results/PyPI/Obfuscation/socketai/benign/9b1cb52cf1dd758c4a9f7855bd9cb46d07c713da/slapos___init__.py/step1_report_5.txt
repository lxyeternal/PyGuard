  "purpose": "Declare a namespace package for the current module, enabling it to be extended across multiple distributions.",
  "sources": "__name__ and __path__ variables used for namespace declaration",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data handling or output operations",
  "flows": "Namespace declaration flows from __name__ and __path__ to namespace package setup, with conditional import handling",
  "anomalies": "Use of __import__ and extend_path for namespace management is standard; no suspicious or malicious patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to declare a namespace package. It first tries to import 'pkg_resources' to declare the namespace, which is typical in Python 2/3 compatible namespace packages. If 'pkg_resources' is unavailable, it falls back to 'pkgutil.extend_path' to extend the __path__ for namespace sharing. Both methods are standard for namespace package setup and do not involve any suspicious behavior or malicious intent. No untrusted inputs are processed, and there are no side effects or network operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard pattern for setting up namespace packages in Python and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
