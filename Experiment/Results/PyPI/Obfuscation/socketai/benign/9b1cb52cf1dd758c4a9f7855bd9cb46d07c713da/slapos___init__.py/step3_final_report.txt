{
  "purpose": "Establishes a namespace package in Python, allowing multiple packages to share a common namespace.",
  "sources": "Importing 'pkg_resources' and 'pkgutil' modules, reading __name__ and __path__ variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, external network calls, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Import 'pkg_resources' to declare namespace -> fallback to 'pkgutil.extend_path' to modify __path__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code uses standard namespace package pattern with fallback.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to declare a namespace package by first importing 'pkg_resources' to call 'declare_namespace(__name__)'. If that fails, it falls back to using 'pkgutil.extend_path' to modify '__path__'. Both are standard practices. No untrusted data, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The code is straightforward, with no suspicious constructs or malicious intent. The fallback ensures compatibility without introducing security risks. The code is well-understood and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe pattern for namespace packages in Python with no malicious or security concerns. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, which are appropriate given the code's simplicity and purpose.",
