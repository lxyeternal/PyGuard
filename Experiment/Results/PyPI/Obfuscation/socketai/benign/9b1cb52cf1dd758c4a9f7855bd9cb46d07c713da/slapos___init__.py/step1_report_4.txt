  "purpose": "Declare a namespace package for a Python distribution, allowing multiple packages to contribute to the same namespace.",
  "sources": "Attempt to import 'pkg_resources' and declare the namespace; fallback to extending __path__ with 'pkgutil.extend_path' if ImportError occurs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not handle untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "Imports and conditional extension of __path__ based on module namespace declaration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code; standard namespace package pattern; no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code tries to declare a namespace package using 'pkg_resources'. If 'pkg_resources' isn't available, it falls back to extending the package's __path__ with 'pkgutil.extend_path'. Both actions are common in namespace package implementations. There are no dynamic code executions, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors. The code follows a typical pattern for supporting namespace packages without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a standard namespace package declaration with a fallback mechanism, and there is no indication of malicious behavior or security risks.",
