  "conclusion": "The script is a benign package setup with obfuscated variable names. No malicious activity or security risks are detected. The high obfuscation score is justified, but it does not indicate malicious intent. The malware score remains at 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.2). The reports' assessments are consistent with the code's behavior."
