{
  "purpose": "A setup script for the 'kddky0lrzd7mpwaf' package that collects timezone data files from 'pytz/zoneinfo' and passes metadata to setup().",
  "sources": "Filesystem traversal of 'pytz/zoneinfo' directory using os.walk, reading static strings and package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, network activity, or dynamic code execution; data flows only within filesystem and static variables.",
  "flows": "Filesystem walk collects files; data passed directly to setup() without modification or external input.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of variable names; presence of nonsensical variable identifiers, but no malicious code or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup tasks: collecting timezone files and invoking setup() with static and dynamically gathered data. No network, code injection, or data exfiltration is present. Obfuscation is superficial, likely for code generation or concealment, but does not imply malicious intent. The filesystem traversal and static data usage are benign. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign package setup with obfuscated variable names. No malicious activity or security risks are detected. The high obfuscation score is justified, but it does not indicate malicious intent. The malware score remains at 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.2). The reports' assessments are consistent with the code's behavior.",
