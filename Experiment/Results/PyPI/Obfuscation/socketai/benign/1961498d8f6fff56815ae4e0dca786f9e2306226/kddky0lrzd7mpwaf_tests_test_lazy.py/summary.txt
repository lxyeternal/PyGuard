  "security_risk": 0.4,
  "obfuscated": 0.8,
  "confidence": 0.75,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits significant obfuscation and suspicious patterns, but no definitive malicious payloads are detected. The suspicious import and dynamic appending of undefined functions warrant further dynamic analysis and source verification. The overall risk is moderate, with low malware likelihood but high obfuscation concern."
