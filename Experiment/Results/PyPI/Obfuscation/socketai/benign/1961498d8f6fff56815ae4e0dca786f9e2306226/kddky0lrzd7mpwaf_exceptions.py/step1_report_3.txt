{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define custom exception classes and constants, likely for use in a larger application, with no clear malicious intent.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs, such as network or file operations, are present.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code only defines classes and constants.",
  "anomalies": "Class names and variable names are obfuscated and nonsensical, which could be an attempt to hide malicious intent or to evade detection. No functional logic, but the obfuscation is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of class definitions inheriting from Exception and KeyError, with class variables assigned string values. No data processing, input/output, or network operations are present. The obfuscated naming and random string assignments are common in malicious code to hide intent, but here they are only in class and variable names without additional context. No malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be intentionally obfuscated class definitions with no explicit malicious behavior or security risks. It may be part of a larger obfuscated codebase or a template for exceptions. No malware or security threats are detectable from this snippet alone.",
