{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a unit test to verify that a README.rst file located two directories above is ASCII encoded by reading it in binary mode and decoding as ASCII.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.rst file located two directories above via open() in binary mode.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed; the code only reads a local file and performs decoding.",
  "flows": "File is opened in binary mode, read, and decoded as ASCII within a test case.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names but no malicious or suspicious code; no external data or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a straightforward file read and ASCII decode as part of a unit test. Variable names are obfuscated but do not indicate malicious intent. No network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection is present. The obfuscation appears superficial, possibly stylistic. The code's purpose is benign, and no anomalies or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign testing utility verifying ASCII encoding of a README file. No malicious or security-compromising behavior is present. The obfuscation is superficial and not malicious. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is moderate (~0.4), and security risk is minimal (~0.1), all consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
