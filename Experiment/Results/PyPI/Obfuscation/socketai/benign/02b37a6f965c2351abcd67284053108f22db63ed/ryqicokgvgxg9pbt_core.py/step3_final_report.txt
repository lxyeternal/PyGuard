{
  "purpose": "The code handles SSL/TLS certificate extraction, fingerprint generation, and header parsing related to security protocols.",
  "sources": "Reads network responses, particularly raw socket data and certificate DER data.",
  "sinks": "Generates cryptographic hashes, logs warnings, and returns certificate fingerprints; no data exfiltration or malicious data flow detected.",
  "flows": "Extracts peer certificates from network sockets, hashes them, and processes header strings for authentication schemes.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated variable and class names; no malicious actions but obfuscation may hinder analysis.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard SSL/TLS certificate processing, including extracting peer certificates, computing hashes, and parsing headers. Exception handling is appropriate. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are evident. Obfuscation is present but appears to serve concealment rather than malicious intent. The functions align with security utilities used in certificate validation and fingerprinting.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate security utility for SSL certificate fingerprinting and header parsing. No evidence of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. Obfuscation is notable but not indicative of malicious intent. The malware score remains at 0, with a low security risk score of 0.2, and an obfuscation score of 0.7 reflecting the obfuscation level.",
