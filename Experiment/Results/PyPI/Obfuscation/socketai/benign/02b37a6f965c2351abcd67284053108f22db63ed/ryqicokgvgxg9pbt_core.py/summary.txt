  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate security utility for SSL certificate fingerprinting and header parsing. No evidence of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. Obfuscation is notable but not indicative of malicious intent. The malware score remains at 0, with a low security risk score of 0.2, and an obfuscation score of 0.7 reflecting the obfuscation level."
