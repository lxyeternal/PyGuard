{
  "purpose": "A setup.py script configuring package metadata, dependencies, and URL, with obfuscated variable names.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file, static dependency lists, string formatting for URL and version.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input, no network activity, no data leaks or code execution.",
  "flows": "Static data used for package setup; no runtime data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, dynamic URL and version string, superficial obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names likely for concealment. No malicious code, network activity, or data exfiltration is present. The obfuscation appears superficial, serving to hinder casual reading rather than conceal malicious intent. The version string indicates a beta release, which is typical. Dependencies and metadata are standard. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated package setup script with no malicious activity or security risks. The superficial obfuscation does not indicate malicious intent, and the package appears safe for use.",
