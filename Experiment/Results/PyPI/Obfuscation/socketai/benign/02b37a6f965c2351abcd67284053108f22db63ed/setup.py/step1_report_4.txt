{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package, including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'README.md' file, static string variables, and package metadata definitions.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Uses static data for dependencies and metadata; no flow of untrusted input to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names (e.g., OrNKejOaeWObQEuMksUCeHiTKcumsIZC), obfuscated-like variable names, and use of string concatenation in the 'url' field. No clear malicious intent but suggestive of obfuscation techniques or hidden intent. No hardcoded secrets found. No dynamic execution or code injection observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python package setup script with intentionally obfuscated variable names, which might be to evade static detection or conceal some intent. All dependencies and package metadata are static, and the file operations are standard. No code injections, backdoors, or malicious network activity are evident. The obfuscation appears superficial, possibly for concealment rather than malicious activity. The code reads a README file and sets up package metadata, which is typical. No suspicious network or system calls are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names, likely for concealment purposes, but contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It does not exhibit malicious activity, backdoors, or harmful logic. Overall, the code is benign with low confidence of malicious intent.",
