  "conclusion": "The snippet shows obfuscated class and variable names but no active malicious code or data flow. The suspicion arises solely from obfuscation, which warrants further review of the imported modules. Current scores are appropriate; no definitive malicious activity is identified. Continued investigation of the full modules is recommended before making a final security assessment."
