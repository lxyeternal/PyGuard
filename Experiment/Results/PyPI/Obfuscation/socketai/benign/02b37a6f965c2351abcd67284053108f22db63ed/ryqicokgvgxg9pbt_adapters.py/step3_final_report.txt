  "purpose": "A minimal descriptive comment indicating a thin wrapper around requests.adapters.HTTPAdapter.",
  "sources": "No data sources; only a comment or placeholder.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; code contains only a descriptive comment.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, only a comment; no anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet is purely a comment indicating a wrapper around requests.adapters.HTTPAdapter, with no executable logic, data handling, or network activity. The security assessments across all reports correctly identify the lack of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is appropriately set to 0, as there is no evidence of malicious intent. The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the absence of obfuscation. The confidence levels are high, reflecting certainty that the code is benign or merely descriptive. Given the minimal nature, no further analysis or action is necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, non-executable comment or placeholder with no security risks or malicious intent. The current scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the evidence.",
