Without functional code, there are no data sources, sinks, or flows to analyze. Since this is merely a comment, it cannot perform malicious actions or contain malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is only a comment describing a wrapper class. There is no executable code, no malicious behavior, and no security risks identified. It appears to be a placeholder or a description rather than functional code.",
