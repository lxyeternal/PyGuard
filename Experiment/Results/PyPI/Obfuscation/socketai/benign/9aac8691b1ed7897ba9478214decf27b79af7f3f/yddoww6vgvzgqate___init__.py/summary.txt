  "conclusion": "The code shows obfuscation and dynamic loading that could conceal malicious behavior, but no explicit malicious actions are evident. The scores assigned are reasonable; however, the obfuscation warrants caution. It is advisable to monitor runtime behavior and verify the source of the dynamically loaded modules."
