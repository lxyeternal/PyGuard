  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code and considering the criteria for malware, obfuscation, and risk scores.\n\n**General observations across reports:**\n- The code is heavily obfuscated with nonsensical function and variable names.\n- It performs neuroimaging data analysis (EEG/NIRS) using the MNE library.\n- Several variables (e.g., 'channels', 'nirs', 'label_class', 'std_class', 'condition') are used without prior definition, indicating incomplete or placeholder code.\n- Channel renaming via lambda functions slicing off the last four characters is suspicious, possibly an obfuscation technique.\n- No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious commands are explicitly present.\n- The code appears to perform standard analysis tasks: plotting, statistical calculations, data filtering.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Analyzes and visualizes EEG/NIRS epoch data, computes statistical measures.\n- **Anomalies:** Nonsensical function names, undefined variables ('condition', 'channels', 'nirs', 'label_class', 'std_class'), renaming channels with slicing.\n- **Analysis:** Obfuscated but aligns with typical neurodata analysis; no malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** No evidence of malicious intent; primarily obfuscated analysis code.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0.6, Risk=0.2\n- **Justification:** Obfuscation is moderate; no malware detected. Risk is low but slightly elevated due to obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar neuroimaging analysis, data from MNE objects.\n- **Anomalies:** Obfuscated variable names, undefined variables, renaming channels, incomplete context.\n- **Analysis:** Standard neuroanalysis with obfuscation; no malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Low security risk, mainly obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0.7, Risk=0.2\n- **Justification:** Higher obfuscation score due to more suspicious naming; no malware detected.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** EEG/NIRS data processing, visualization.\n- **Anomalies:** Obfuscated variable names, undefined variables, channel renaming, redundant log level setting.\n- **Analysis:** Typical neurodata analysis, obfuscated but benign.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior; low risk.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0.7, Risk=0.2\n- **Justification:** Obfuscation is significant but no malware evidence.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** EEG/NIRS data analysis, plotting, statistics.\n- **Anomalies:** Obfuscated naming, inconsistent variable references, channel renaming, incomplete code.\n- **Analysis:** Standard neuroanalysis with obfuscation; no malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** No malware, low security risk.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0.7, Risk=0.2\n- **Justification:** Similar to others, obfuscation is notable but no malware.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** EEG/NIRS data analysis, visualization.\n- **Anomalies:** Obfuscated function/variable names, undefined variables, channel renaming, no network or malicious commands.\n- **Analysis:** Typical analysis code, obfuscated but benign.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity; low risk.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0.4, Risk=0.2\n- **Justification:** Less obfuscated than others, but still significant obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports consistently rate malware at 0.0. The code shows no signs of malicious payloads, network activity, or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscated score:** High across reports (0.6–0.7), indicating significant obfuscation, variable renaming, and nonsensical naming.\n- **Risk score:** Uniformly low (0.2), reflecting minimal security threat but acknowledging the obfuscation could hinder analysis or review.\n\n---\n\n### **My expert estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0 — no evidence of malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.65 — consistent with the heavily obfuscated code structure.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — primarily due to obfuscation, which could mask malicious activity but does not currently show any.\n\n**Final note:** The code appears to be an obfuscated neuroimaging analysis script, with no malicious behavior detected. The obfuscation could be for proprietary reasons, or to hinder reverse engineering, but it does not inherently imply malicious intent.",
