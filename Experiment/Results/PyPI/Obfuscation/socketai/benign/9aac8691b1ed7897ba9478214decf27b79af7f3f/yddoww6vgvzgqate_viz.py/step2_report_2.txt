  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Issues & observations:**  \n  - Function names and variable names are nonsensical, suggesting obfuscation.  \n  - Undefined variables (`condition`, `channels`, `nirs`, `label_class`, `std_class`) are used, indicating incomplete code or obfuscation.  \n  - The code performs standard statistical calculations and plotting, with no evidence of malicious activity.  \n  - Renaming channels with slicing could be an obfuscation tactic.  \n  - The function `set_log_level` is used to suppress logs, which is common in analysis scripts.  \n  - No network activity or data exfiltration observed.\n\n- **Risk assessment:**  \n  - Obfuscation and incomplete code reduce clarity but do not inherently imply malicious intent.  \n  - Malware score: **0** (no malicious activity detected).  \n  - Obfuscated score: **0.6** (significant obfuscation).  \n  - Security risk: **0.2** (low).\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Issues & observations:**  \n  - Similar obfuscation with nonsensical function/variable names.  \n  - Uses `get_data()` and plotting functions as in typical neuroimaging workflows.  \n  - Undefined variables (`channels`, `nirs`, `label_class`, `std_class`) again suggest incomplete or obfuscated code.  \n  - No network activity or malicious commands.  \n  - Channel renaming with slicing again appears to be an obfuscation or data handling tactic.\n\n- **Risk assessment:**  \n  - No malicious activity detected.  \n  - Malware score: **0**.  \n  - Obfuscated score: **0.7** (high obfuscation).  \n  - Security risk: **0.2**.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Issues & observations:**  \n  - Similar pattern: obfuscated variable/function names, undefined variables, inconsistent references.  \n  - Standard neuroimaging analysis with plotting and statistical summaries.  \n  - No network activity or malicious commands.  \n  - Use of `set_log_level` and data processing appears benign.\n\n- **Risk assessment:**  \n  - No malware detected.  \n  - Malware score: **0**.  \n  - Obfuscated score: **0.7**.  \n  - Security risk: **0.2**.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Issues & observations:**  \n  - Obfuscated names, inconsistent variable references, undefined variables (`channels`, `nirs`, `label_class`, `std_class`, `condition`, `labels`).  \n  - No network activity or malicious commands.  \n  - The code performs typical neuroimaging data analysis and visualization.\n\n- **Risk assessment:**  \n  - No malicious activity.  \n  - Malware score: **0**.  \n  - Obfuscated score: **0.7**.  \n  - Security risk: **0.2**.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Issues & observations:**  \n  - Similar obfuscation and inconsistent variable references.  \n  - No network or data exfiltration.  \n  - Standard analysis functions with some placeholder variables.  \n  - No malicious patterns detected.\n\n- **Risk assessment:**  \n  - Malware score: **0**.  \n  - Obfuscated score: **0.4** (less obfuscated than others).  \n  - Security risk: **0.2**.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis & Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware risk:** All reports show no evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The obfuscation appears to be either intentional (to hide complexity) or due to incomplete code snippets.  \n- **Obfuscation:** High across all reports, with scores around 0.6–0.7, indicating significant code obfuscation or renaming.  \n- **Security risk:** Very low, as no malicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected).  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0.65** (consistent with the reports).  \n- **Risk score:** **0.2** (low, primarily due to obfuscation, not malicious intent).\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nThe core functionality appears to be neuroimaging data analysis, with suspicious naming and incomplete variable definitions. These are red flags for obfuscation but not necessarily malicious behavior. No evidence supports a malware or security breach conclusion.",
