{
  "purpose": "This code performs feature extraction and preprocessing on neuroimaging data, specifically handling epochs from MNE (MEG/EEG) datasets, including cropping, channel reordering, and feature computation.",
  "sources": "Input data includes mne_epochs object (likely from the MNE library), environmental variables, and feature_list parameter; data is read from the epochs object and environmental variables for cropping and filtering.",
  "sinks": "Processed data is stored in numpy arrays; no direct data leaks or untrusted data sinks are evident. No network transmission or file writing observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input epochs object through copying, cropping, optional bad segment removal, channel reordering, feature extraction, and finally returns feature arrays. No external untrusted data flows outside function scope.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes verbose variable names with no clear semantic meaning, print statements revealing internal mappings, and optional use of environment variables for data filtering. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external connections are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code processes MNE epoch data with standard operations such as copying, cropping, and bad segment removal based on environmental parameters. It maps event labels and subject IDs to numeric labels, applies channel reordering if specified, extracts features based on the feature_list parameter (mean, std, slope, skew, kurtosis, ttp, peak), and constructs feature matrices. No obfuscated code, suspicious network activity, or malicious behavior detected. The print statements could reveal internal mappings but are not inherently malicious. The code seems to perform legitimate feature extraction for neuroimaging analysis.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs legitimate feature extraction and preprocessing on neuroimaging epoch data. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected; the only notable aspect is verbose variable names and internal print statements. The overall security risk is low.",
