  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate neuroimaging feature extraction script with obfuscation and debug statements. There is no evidence of malware, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation and print statements are not inherently malicious but could be cleaned for production. Overall, the security risk is very low."
