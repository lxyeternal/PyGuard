{
  "purpose": "The code processes neuroimaging data (e.g., EEG/fNIRS) using the MNE library, performing cropping, filtering, feature extraction (mean, std, slope, skewness, kurtosis, peak, trough), and mapping event IDs and subject IDs for analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads data from 'mne_epochs' object attributes, including cropping, bad segment dropping, and event/subject ID mappings.",
  "sinks": "No external data flows or network activity; processes data internally without leaking or transmitting data externally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input 'mne_epochs' through cropping, filtering, feature extraction, and mapping functions, resulting in feature arrays and label mappings.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated variable names, print statements referencing 'event_to_label' and 'subj_to_group' which are undefined in the snippet, indicating incomplete code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard neuroimaging data preprocessing and feature extraction without any malicious payloads. The obfuscated variable names and debug print statements suggest obfuscation or auto-generation but do not imply malicious intent. No network activity, credential handling, or data exfiltration is evident. The print statements may leak internal mappings but are typical debugging artifacts. The overall structure indicates a benign data processing pipeline.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate neuroimaging feature extraction script with obfuscation and debug statements. There is no evidence of malware, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation and print statements are not inherently malicious but could be cleaned for production. Overall, the security risk is very low.",
