{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a data processing and analysis pipeline for fNIRS datasets, including data loading, filtering, channel combination, event detection, epoch extraction, and data structuring for further analysis.",
  "sources": "File inputs via scipy.io.loadmat for dataset files; user inputs for subject identifiers and paths; data from external files loaded during processing functions.",
  "sinks": "Data structures passed to MNE functions for epoch creation and event marking; no data leaks or external data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Data loaded from files → preprocessed with filtering and channel combination → event markers generated and processed → epochs created for analysis → output structured as MNE Raw and Epoch objects.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of variable and function names that appear obfuscated or randomly generated, which can be suspicious but are not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials or secret keys detected. The code dynamically loads multiple datasets, but no external network communication or suspicious side effects are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs data loading, filtering, and epoching for fNIRS datasets, with functions structured to handle multiple datasets based on dataset identifiers. The functions utilize scipy.io.loadmat to load MATLAB data files and process them for analysis. There are no network operations, data exfiltration, or side effects such as system modifications. Variable and function names appear intentionally obfuscated but do not indicate malicious intent. The code does not include any suspicious external calls, command executions, or hidden backdoors. Its structure aligns with standard data processing pipelines, and no signs of malware or sabotage are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard fNIRS data processing pipeline with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The obfuscated naming conventions do not contribute to malicious intent, and there are no network or system-impacting operations. The main risks relate to proper data handling and ensuring dataset integrity, but no security threats are identified.",
