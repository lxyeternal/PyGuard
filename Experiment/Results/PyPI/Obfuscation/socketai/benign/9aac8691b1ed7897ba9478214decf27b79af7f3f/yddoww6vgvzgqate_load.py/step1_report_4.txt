{
  "purpose": "The code loads, preprocesses, filters, and extracts features from NIRS datasets for analysis and epoching, primarily for research purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads multiple MATLAB '.mat' files containing datasets, labels, event markers, and channel information; also reads environmental variables and command-line input status.",
  "sinks": "The code creates and manipulates MNE Raw and Epochs objects, but does not explicitly write or transmit data externally; no network sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input data from files (loadmat) → data processing and filtering functions → creation of MNE Raw/Epochs objects → optional resampling and channel combination → output data structures.",
  "anomalies": "Extensive use of dynamic file path construction and dataset-specific data processing functions; the code does not perform any network communication, data exfiltration, or execution of external code. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are observed. The variable names are obfuscated or non-descriptive but do not imply malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily loads data from MATLAB files, processes the data with filtering, epoching, and event annotation, and constructs MNE data objects. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoor mechanisms are detected. All functions operate on datasets that are loaded locally and processed in-memory, with no indication of malicious code injections or hidden behaviors. Variable names are obfuscated but contextually relate to data handling, not malicious purposes. The only potentially concerning aspect is the obfuscated style and dynamic handling of data, but it aligns with standard data processing practices rather than malicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate data processing pipeline for NIRS datasets, with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The obfuscated variable names are likely a coding style choice, not an indicator of malicious intent. There are no network, system modification, or exfiltration behaviors detected.",
