{
  "purpose": "The code loads and preprocesses neuroimaging (fNIRS) data from MATLAB files, converting them into MNE Raw objects, applying filtering, and segmenting into epochs based on events.",
  "sources": "File reads via scipy.io.loadmat, data extraction from MATLAB structures, and event markers from loaded data; data is read from local files.",
  "sinks": "Data is processed in-memory; no external network communication or data exfiltration detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file load into variables, then into MNE Raw and Epochs objects, with filtering and event marking applied locally.",
  "anomalies": "Variable and function names are intentionally obfuscated, but this appears stylistic rather than malicious; no suspicious code injection or external data leaks.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard neuroimaging data loading, filtering, and epoching using common scientific libraries. No network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. Obfuscation is significant but appears stylistic, not malicious. The data handling is local, and no suspicious flows or external communications are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate scientific data processing pipeline for fNIRS datasets. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The obfuscation is stylistic, and the overall security risk is low.",
