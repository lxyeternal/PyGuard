{
  "purpose": "Metadata extraction from images using 'exiftool', with sandboxed or direct execution, and cleanup of output files.",
  "sources": "External command invocation ('exiftool'), filesystem checks and deletions, JSON output parsing.",
  "sinks": "External process execution, file deletion, JSON data handling.",
  "flows": "Input parameters and class attributes flow into subprocess commands; subprocess output flows into JSON parsing and data filtering.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names, dynamic command construction, reliance on external binaries without explicit validation, minimal input validation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs legitimate image metadata extraction, utilizing sandboxing to limit potential impact. It manages external tool invocation, handles output files, and processes JSON data. Obfuscation is present but appears to serve concealment rather than malicious intent. No network activity, data exfiltration, or payloads are evident. Error handling is broad but appropriate. The reliance on external binaries and obfuscation could be exploited if inputs are malicious, but no such activity is detected in the code or reports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for image metadata extraction with obfuscation that raises suspicion but lacks evidence of malicious behavior. It poses low security risk and no malware threat based on current analysis.",
