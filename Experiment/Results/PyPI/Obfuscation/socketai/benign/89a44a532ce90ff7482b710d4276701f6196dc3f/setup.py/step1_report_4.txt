{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'mat2', defining metadata, dependencies, and package information.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file, hardcoded strings for package metadata, and package configuration variables.",
  "sinks": "None of the code explicitly sends data over network, writes to files, or executes untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; data is primarily used for package setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names (e.g., RlUUzexaAhqLNNxRZNcMThLhxnRxOMyX), inconsistent formatting, and obfuscated-like naming; no actual obfuscation, but the variable naming could indicate an attempt to hide intent.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks, including reading a README file and configuring package metadata using setuptools. The variable names are unconventional and somewhat obfuscated, but no actual malicious logic, network activity, or security risks are evident. The code does not include any code execution, external data processing, or malicious behavior. The irregular variable naming might be an anomaly but does not constitute malicious intent. Overall, the code appears to be a standard setup script with unconventional variable names.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical package setup script with unusual variable names but no malicious behavior or security risks detected. No indicators of malware, data leaks, or malicious activities are present.",
