{
  "purpose": "Set up a Python package called 'mat2' with metadata, dependencies, and data files for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file; hardcoded strings for package metadata; package setup parameters",
  "sinks": "None of the code shows untrusted data sinks; no external data output or network communication",
  "flows": "Reading README.md -> passing data to setuptools.setup -> package installation process",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names and strings (e.g., RlUUzexaAhqLNNxRZNcMThLhxnRxOMyX), but they contain only static strings, no dynamic code execution; inconsistent variable naming with no apparent malicious intent",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard setup routine for a Python package, reading a README file and passing static, well-formed parameters to setuptools.setup. Variable names are obfuscated but only contain string literals. No untrusted input handling, network operations, or code execution appears present. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behaviors are evident. The obfuscation seems superficial, possibly for minimal concealment, but does not indicate malicious intent. No signs of malware, data exfiltration, or malicious activity are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup script with obfuscated variable names but no malicious behavior. It appears to be a legitimate package setup routine with no security risks or malware indications.",
