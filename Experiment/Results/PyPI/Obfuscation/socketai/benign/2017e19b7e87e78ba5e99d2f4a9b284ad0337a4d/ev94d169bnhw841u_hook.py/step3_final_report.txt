{
  "purpose": "This code sets up custom Django signals for transaction events and wraps Django's transaction functions to emit these signals at appropriate points, facilitating transaction management and event handling.",
  "sources": "Django's transaction system, environment variables, dynamic import paths, and signal dispatch points.",
  "sinks": "Signal emission functions, dynamic module import, and potential external signal handlers.",
  "flows": "Signals are sent during transaction commit, rollback, and management events; no data flows to external systems or network.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with obscure variable names, dynamic import usage, and function wrapping, which could be used to hide malicious behavior but no malicious activity is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages Django transaction signals with complex wrapping and dynamic imports. No evidence of malicious actions such as data exfiltration, network communication, or system tampering. The obfuscation and dynamic import could be exploited if external inputs influence module paths, but in this context, they appear controlled. The signal management functions are standard Django patterns, just obfuscated.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a legitimate Django transaction signal management layer with obfuscation. There is no detected malicious activity, but the obfuscation warrants cautious review. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is high (~0.75), and overall security risk is low (~0.2).",
