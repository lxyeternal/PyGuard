      "conclusion": "The code does not contain malicious code or active malicious behavior but employs obfuscation that could be used to hide dependencies or malicious intent. The improper use of setup parameters and obfuscated variable name warrant caution. Overall, the package appears benign but suspicious in structure, suggesting further review before deployment."

      "conclusion": "The code appears benign with obfuscation but no evidence of malicious activity. The import of 'hook' could be harmless or part of a larger malicious pattern, but based solely on this snippet, the behavior is safe. The obfuscation score remains high due to the function name, but malware and security risk scores should be low. Further context is needed to definitively assess the 'hook' module."

      "conclusion": "The code functions as a legitimate Django transaction signal management layer with obfuscation. There is no detected malicious activity, but the obfuscation warrants cautious review. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is high (~0.75), and overall security risk is low (~0.2)."
