  "purpose": "Define GraphQL types and mutations using the strawberry library, with functions returning instances of imported classes.",
  "sources": "Imports of classes from local modules (.auto, .queue, .scheduler); method calls returning new class instances.",
  "sinks": "Return statements that instantiate and return imported classes; no external data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Method calls returning class instances directly; no data processing or external communication observed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated class and function names; no comments or documentation; no visible hardcoded secrets or sensitive info.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes from local modules and defines GraphQL mutations that return instances of these classes. The class and method names are intentionally obfuscated, which might be an attempt to conceal functionality or discourage analysis. There is no evidence of data input handling, external network communication, or malicious operations such as data exfiltration, system modification, or obfuscation techniques that serve malicious purposes. The code appears to implement straightforward factory methods for returning instances. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident based solely on this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code defines GraphQL mutations returning instances of imported classes with obfuscated names. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this fragment. The obfuscation might be for code concealment but does not directly indicate malicious intent.",
