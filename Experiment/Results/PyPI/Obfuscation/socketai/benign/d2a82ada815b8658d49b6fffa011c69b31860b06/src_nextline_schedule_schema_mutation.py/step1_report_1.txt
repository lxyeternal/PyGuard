  "purpose": "Define GraphQL types and mutations for a Python application using the strawberry library.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules (.auto, .queue, .scheduler). No external input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "Return statements that instantiate classes from imported modules; no direct data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Method calls instantiate and return objects from imported modules; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated class and function names; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no dynamic code execution or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines GraphQL types and mutations with obfuscated class and method names. The imports are from local modules, with no signs of external or malicious data input. The mutation methods instantiate and return objects from imported classes, likely representing data or operation results. No user input handling, environment variable usage, or network activity is present. The obfuscated naming may suggest an attempt to conceal intent, but no malicious actions are evident within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard GraphQL type and mutation definitions with obfuscated names. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks within this fragment. The obfuscation alone does not indicate malicious intent but warrants further review of the imported modules for comprehensive security assessment.",
