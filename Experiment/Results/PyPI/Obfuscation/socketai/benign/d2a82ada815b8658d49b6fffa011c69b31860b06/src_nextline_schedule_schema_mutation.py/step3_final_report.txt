  "purpose": "Defines GraphQL schema types and mutations with obfuscated class and method names, serving as part of a GraphQL API implementation.",
  "sources": "Local module imports (.auto, .queue, .scheduler); class and method definitions that instantiate imported classes.",
  "sinks": "Return statements instantiate objects from imported modules; no external data sources or untrusted inputs are used.",
  "flows": "Methods instantiate and return objects from local modules; no external data flow or network activity observed.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated class and method names; no secrets, environment variables, or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward GraphQL schema setup using the strawberry library, with obfuscated identifiers. No external inputs, network activity, or malicious behaviors are present. The obfuscation may be stylistic or proprietary, not necessarily malicious. All reports correctly identify the obfuscation but agree that no malicious activity is evident. The malware score is justified as 0, and the obfuscation score as 0.7, reflecting the obfuscated naming. The low security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate given the benign nature of the code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard GraphQL schema definition with obfuscated identifiers, with no signs of malicious intent or activity. The high obfuscation warrants further review of imported modules but does not elevate the security risk significantly. Overall, the code is benign based on this fragment.",
