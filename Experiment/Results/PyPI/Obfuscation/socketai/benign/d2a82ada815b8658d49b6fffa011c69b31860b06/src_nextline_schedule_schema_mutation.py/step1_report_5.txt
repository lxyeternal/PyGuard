  "purpose": "Define GraphQL types and mutations using the Strawberry library, with functions returning instances of imported modules.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.auto, .queue, .scheduler); class methods that instantiate and return imported classes.",
  "sinks": "Return statements that instantiate and return objects; no external data sources or untrusted input handling present.",
  "flows": "Method calls returning instances from imports do not process external data; flow appears limited to object instantiation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class and method names (e.g., wfhFodNLxcutdvGgIFHiYjjRTSRTaxHN, ZzpnsfGZlNkBJcBflzKraZyOnFxJRnYL). No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up GraphQL mutation classes with methods returning instances of imported classes. No external input handling or untrusted data sources are evident. The naming conventions appear obfuscated but do not necessarily indicate malicious intent. There are no signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious network activity. The imports are local modules, and the methods simply instantiate and return objects. Overall, the structure is consistent with standard GraphQL schema definitions, with no clear malicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a GraphQL schema setup using Strawberry, with obfuscated naming but no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be legitimate application code without malicious intent.",
