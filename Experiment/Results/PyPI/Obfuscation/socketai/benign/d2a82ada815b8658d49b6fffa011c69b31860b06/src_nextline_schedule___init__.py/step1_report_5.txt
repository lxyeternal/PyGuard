  "purpose": "Exporting module attributes and importing potentially obfuscated variables from internal modules.",
  "sources": "The code imports a variable 'hWZsPdGDiuqIaywtuoqYpszgqceZMzNA' from __about__ and 'AfgYnubwmQvBfQSaSURxZuQFQNytqpZf' from plugin.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network calls, file writes, or system modifications are evident in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The code imports obfuscated or dynamically named variables, but there are no apparent flows of untrusted data or commands.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of highly obfuscated variable names suggests code hiding or obfuscation, but no active malicious actions are shown.",
  "analysis": "The module defines __all__ for exports, then imports two variables with complex, non-descriptive names from internal modules. There is no visible code execution, data handling, or suspicious behavior. The obfuscated variable names could be benign or an attempt at hiding functionality, but without further context, they are not inherently malicious. No code injection, data leaks, or malicious network activity is detected in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a minimal module setup with obfuscated variable names, possibly to hide implementation details. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet, but the obfuscation warrants caution if more code is present elsewhere.",
