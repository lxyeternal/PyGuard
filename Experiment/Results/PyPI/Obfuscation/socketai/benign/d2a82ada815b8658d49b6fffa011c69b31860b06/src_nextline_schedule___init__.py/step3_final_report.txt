  "purpose": "Define __all__ for module exports and import obfuscated identifiers from internal modules (__about__ and plugin).",
  "sources": "Imports from .__about__ and .plugin modules, reading obfuscated identifiers.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows; static import statements only.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data handling; purely static imports.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated variable names, minimal code structure, no visible logic or data processing.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet is minimal, consisting of defining __all__ and importing two obfuscated symbols from internal modules. There is no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling. The obfuscated identifiers could be benign (e.g., to prevent reverse engineering) or malicious (to hide malicious code). The malware score is appropriately zero, reflecting no evidence of malicious activity. The high obfuscation score (around 0.75) indicates significant obfuscation, which warrants further review of the imported modules. The low security risk score (0.2) aligns with the absence of active threats. The confidence score (around 0.7) is reasonable given the limited code and cautious analysis. Overall, the code appears to be a standard, obfuscated module setup with no immediate security concerns, but the obfuscation warrants further review of the imported modules to ensure safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet shows minimal, obfuscated imports with no malicious activity detected. The high obfuscation score suggests further review of the imported modules is advisable. The malware and security risk scores are appropriate and consistent with the evidence. No active threats are evident from this fragment.",
