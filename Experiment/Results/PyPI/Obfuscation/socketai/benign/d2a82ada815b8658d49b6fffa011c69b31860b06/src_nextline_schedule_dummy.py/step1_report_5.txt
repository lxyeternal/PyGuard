  "purpose": "Generate a Python script that delays execution randomly and timestamps the execution time.",
  "sources": "Random number generation (random.uniform, random.randint), datetime.utcnow() for timestamp.",
  "sinks": "Generated code string containing time.sleep calls and a timestamp comment.",
  "flows": "Random values from 'random' are used in the generated code to produce sleep commands, and current timestamp is embedded into the code string.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically generates a script with multiple time.sleep() calls with random durations, which could be used to delay or obfuscate execution flow. The use of random and datetime functions alone is benign but could be part of obfuscation or malicious timing delays.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an async class method that returns a string generated by a function. This function constructs a script with multiple 'time.sleep' calls with random durations, and embeds a UTC timestamp as a comment. It imports 'random' and 'datetime', both used in generating the code. The generated code appears to be designed for creating delays, possibly for obfuscation, timing attacks, or other purposes. There is no evidence of malicious network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code relies on random and time delays, which alone are not malicious but can be misused in certain contexts. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code paths are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily designed to generate a script that introduces random delays and timestamps. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks but could be used for obfuscation or timing attacks. No malware or malicious intent is evident.",
