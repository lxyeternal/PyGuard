{
  "purpose": "The code loads GraphQL schema files from various directories relative to the script location, likely for later use in queries or mutations.",
  "sources": "Reads text content from multiple '.gql' files located in specific directories ('auto_mode', 'queue', 'scheduler', 'queries', 'subscriptions')",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks such as network transmission, file writing, or environment variable modifications are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Reads file contents (sources) and stores them in variables; no further processing or transmission shown.",
  "anomalies": "Variables and function names are obfuscated or nonsensical; the code dynamically reads multiple files without validation or sanitization, which may be unusual but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code detected. The pattern of loading many files could be suspicious if used maliciously but is not definitive.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules for filesystem and GraphQL parsing, then defines a function to read and parse GraphQL files, returning their AST printout. It proceeds to resolve directories relative to the script's location, then loads numerous GraphQL schema files into variables. No evidence of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code injection. Variable names are intentionally obscure, but this alone is insufficient to classify as malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed. The script appears to prepare GraphQL schemas, possibly for later operations, but as-is, it does not perform any harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily loads GraphQL schema files from disk with obfuscated variable names, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this fragment. Its main concern could be the obscurity of variable names, which might hinder review, but no malicious activity is evident in this snippet.",
