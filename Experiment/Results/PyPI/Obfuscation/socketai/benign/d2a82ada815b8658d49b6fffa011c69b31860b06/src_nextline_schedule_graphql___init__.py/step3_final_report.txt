  "purpose": "Load and parse GraphQL files, print ASTs.",
  "sources": "Reading GraphQL (.gql) files from specific directories.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data effects or data leaks.",
  "flows": "File read -> parse -> print AST.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names, but no malicious code or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code reads multiple GraphQL files, parses their content into ASTs, and prints them. Variable names are obfuscated, which could be an attempt to hide intent but does not indicate malicious behavior. No network activity, data exfiltration, or code execution is present. The purpose appears to be for loading or processing GraphQL schemas/queries. Scores assigned in reports (malware ~0.1, obfuscated ~0.8, risk ~0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code, with obfuscation being the main suspicious element.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign loader for GraphQL files with obfuscated variable names. No evidence of malicious activity or sabotage is present. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware and security risk scores are appropriately low.",
