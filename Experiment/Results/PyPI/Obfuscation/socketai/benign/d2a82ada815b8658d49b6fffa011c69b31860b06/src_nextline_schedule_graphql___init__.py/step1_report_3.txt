{
  "purpose": "The code reads and parses multiple GraphQL query files from a specific directory structure, returning the content of one file as a string and loading others for potential further use.",
  "sources": "Reading text files from the filesystem using Path.read_text() for multiple .gql files in various directories.",
  "sinks": "None of the untrusted data is used in a way that directly affects system security, such as executing code or passing to unsafe functions. The only sink is reading file content into strings.",
  "flows": "Read file content (source) into variables, parse content with parse(), convert AST back to string with print_ast() — no external or untrusted data execution or network activity is observed.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are obfuscated and non-descriptive, but no indication of malicious code or backdoors. The code appears to be standard file reading and parsing. No hardcoded credentials, network connections, or suspicious behaviors identified.",
  "analysis": "The script loads GraphQL query files from a structured directory, reads their content as text, parses them into AST, and prints them back into string form. No user input, environment variables, or network activity is involved. The obfuscated variable names could be a simple obfuscation technique, but they do not suggest malicious intent. The functions used are standard and do not exhibit suspicious behavior. There is no code injection, no data exfiltration, nor any malicious logic. The code’s purpose appears to be organizational: loading and parsing predefined GraphQL queries.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward loader and parser of GraphQL files, with obfuscated variable names. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident, and it operates solely on local files. There are no signs of malware or security risks in this snippet.",
