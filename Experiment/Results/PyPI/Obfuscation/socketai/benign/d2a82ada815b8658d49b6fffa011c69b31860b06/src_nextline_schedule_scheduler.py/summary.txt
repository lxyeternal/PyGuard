  "conclusion": "The code exhibits obfuscation and external command retrieval patterns typical of stealthy control mechanisms. While no explicit malicious payloads are present, the obfuscation, logging anomalies, and external communication suggest potential misuse. The overall malware score is low to moderate, and security risk is moderate, warranting further review of the external endpoint and context."
