{
  "purpose": "Define a type alias for variables that can be a string, Path, CodeType, or a callable returning any value.",
  "sources": "None explicitly; only import statements and a type alias declaration.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, input/output, or untrusted data handling shown.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow present; the code only declares imports and a type alias.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward type alias definition with standard imports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard Python modules (pathlib, types, typing) and declares a type alias 'bKHRIzcKYhLgUfVcjWRWxIwGDRSurPEx' which can be a str, Path, CodeType, or a Callable returning any. There are no functions, data handling, or dynamic operations. No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The code appears to be a benign setup for type hinting.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple type alias declaration with standard imports, no malicious behavior or security issues detected.",
