{
  "purpose": "The code defines a type alias for a variable that can be a string, Path, CodeType, or a callable returning any type.",
  "sources": "None; no data input sources are present in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where data flows into sensitive operations or outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines a type alias.",
  "anomalies": "The code only contains imports and a type alias definition. No unusual or suspicious behavior is apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries (pathlib, types, typing) and declares a type alias with multiple possible types, including str, Path, CodeType, and Callable. There are no operations, data processing, or malicious constructs present. The alias could be used later in code, but as it stands, it’s a harmless type annotation.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a simple type alias declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not include any suspicious behaviors, data leaks, or malicious code segments.",
