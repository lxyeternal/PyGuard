  "purpose": "Define a type alias that can be a string, Path, CodeType, or Callable returning any type.",
  "sources": "Imports from pathlib, types, and typing modules. The alias assignment itself does not read external data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or processing occurs in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows or processing from sources to sinks; the code only defines a type alias.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a simple import and type alias definition with no suspicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and defines a type alias named 'bKHRIzcKYhLgUfVcjWRWxIwGDRSurPEx' that allows multiple data types. No dynamic execution, data processing, or external input handling is present. The code appears benign and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a basic type alias definition with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or system manipulation. It is safe.",
