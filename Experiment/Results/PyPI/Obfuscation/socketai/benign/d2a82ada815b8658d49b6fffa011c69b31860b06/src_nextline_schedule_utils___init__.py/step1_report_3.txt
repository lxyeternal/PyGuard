  "purpose": "Export specific functions and import two entities from a module named '.utc'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module '.utc' reading two entities, and the __all__ list defining exported functions.",
  "sinks": "No evident untrusted data sinks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; import statement does not process external input.",
  "anomalies": "Imported entities have obfuscated or nonsensical names, which could indicate obfuscation or malicious intent. The code is minimal, with no functions or logic, making analysis limited.",
  "analysis": "The code declares an __all__ list specifying two functions likely intended for export. It imports two entities from a local module with obfuscated or nonsensical names, which is unusual and potentially suspicious. No other code, data processing, or logic is present. The absence of functionality suggests this is a stub or a part of a larger, possibly obfuscated codebase. The suspicious import names warrant caution, as obfuscated identifiers are common in malicious scripts or hidden payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself is minimal but includes suspicious import names that could be obfuscated or malicious. Given the lack of context and the obfuscated import identifiers, there is a potential risk, though no explicit malicious activity is visible. The overall security risk is moderate due to the obfuscation and unusual naming.",
