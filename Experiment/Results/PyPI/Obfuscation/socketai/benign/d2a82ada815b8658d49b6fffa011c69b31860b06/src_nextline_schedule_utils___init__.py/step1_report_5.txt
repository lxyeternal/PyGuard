{
  "purpose": "Define public API with 'is_timezone_aware' and 'utc_timestamp' and import obfuscated symbols from a local module.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing obfuscated symbols from .utc module",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating untrusted data handling or potential leaks; no input/output or external communication",
  "flows": "No flow from sources to sinks; the imported symbols are not used within this snippet",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated symbol names in import; no clear indication of malicious intent but unusual naming; no usage of the imported symbols to evaluate further",
  "analysis": "The code defines two public API symbols and imports two entities with obfuscated names from a local module. There are no direct data flows, input handling, or output. The obfuscated symbol names are suspicious but do not inherently indicate malicious activity. Without further context or usage, this appears to be a standard, albeit obscure, import statement. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are evident in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal, primarily defining an API and importing potentially obfuscated symbols. There is no clear evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet. The obfuscated import names are unusual but not necessarily malicious. Overall, the risk appears low based on this fragment.",
