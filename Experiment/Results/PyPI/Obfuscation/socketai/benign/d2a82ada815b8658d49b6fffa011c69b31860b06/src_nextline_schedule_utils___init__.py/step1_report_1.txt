  "purpose": "Export specific functions and import from a module, likely part of a larger package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a relative module './utc'. No other data input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the import is static.",
  "anomalies": "Imported identifiers ('bbgJVQoFtJeNKByfWOuoBvJhAwYHoEZJ', 'VaRJOqbBfxjvmZUDppMFEmmltQbONVld') are obfuscated or non-descriptive, which could be suspicious. The code does not include any functions or executable statements beyond exports and import.",
  "analysis": "The code exports two functions or variables and imports two entities from a local module. The imported identifiers appear obfuscated or nonsensical, which could indicate intentional concealment. No code logic, data processing, or network activity is present. The structure is minimal, resembling a module declaration. No malicious behaviors, such as data exfiltration or code injection, are evident. The obfuscated names raise some concern but do not definitively indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a simple module setup with obfuscated import names, potentially for obscuring functionality. There is no direct evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. However, the use of obfuscated identifiers warrants cautious review of the imported module to ensure no malicious code is embedded there.",
