{
  "purpose": "The code defines an export list for module functions and imports two obfuscated identifiers from a local module, likely for internal use.",
  "sources": "The import statement from '.utc' with obfuscated identifiers; no other data input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows involving untrusted data; the code does not process external inputs or outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths; the code only declares exports and imports identifiers.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated import identifiers ('bbgJVQoFtJeNKByfWOuoBvJhAwYHoEZJ', 'VaRJOqbBfxjvmZUDppMFEmmltQbONVld') are unusual and could conceal malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, with a list of exported functions and an import of two obfuscated identifiers. No logic, data processing, or network activity is present. The obfuscated identifiers could be used to hide malicious payloads in the imported module. The reports correctly identify the suspicion due to obfuscation but find no evidence of malicious activity. Malware scores are low or zero, aligning with the absence of concrete malicious behavior. The obfuscation warrants caution, but without further context, the code appears benign. The scores across reports are generally appropriate, though the malware score in report 3 could be slightly lowered from 0.3 to 0.1, given no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal and appears benign, with obfuscated identifiers raising suspicion but not indicating malicious activity. The current scores are reasonable; further review of the '.utc' module is recommended to confirm whether the obfuscated identifiers conceal malicious code.",
