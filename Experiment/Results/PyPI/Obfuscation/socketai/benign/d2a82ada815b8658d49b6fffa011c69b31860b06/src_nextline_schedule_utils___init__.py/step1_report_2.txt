  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or output functions present",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code simply imports and exports symbols",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names in the import statement: 'bbgJVQoFtJeNKByfWOuoBvJhAwYHoEZJ' and 'VaRJOqbBfxjvmZUDppMFEmmltQbONVld' appear as obfuscated or nonsensical identifiers, which could indicate obfuscation or malicious intent",
  "analysis": "The code defines an export list '__all__' with two symbol names, indicating intended public API. It imports two items from a local module '.utc' using highly obfuscated or nonsensical names. The naming pattern suggests possible obfuscation or concealment of functionality. No other logic, data handling, or network activity is present. The presence of obfuscated import names could be benign if part of an obfuscation strategy but warrants suspicion due to lack of clarity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be straightforward in defining exports and importing from a local module. However, the use of nonsensical import identifiers raises suspicion of obfuscation, which could be a technique to hide malicious behavior. Without additional context or code, this is inconclusive but warrants cautious review of the corresponding '.utc' module. Overall, low confidence in malicious intent but some concern due to obfuscated names.",
