  "conclusion": "The code functions as a real-time event streaming client with heartbeat management, employing obfuscation that could conceal malicious intent. No direct evidence of malware or malicious activity is present, but the high obfuscation score and session token handling suggest the need for further review in a secure environment. The overall security risk is moderate, with low malware likelihood but high obfuscation."
