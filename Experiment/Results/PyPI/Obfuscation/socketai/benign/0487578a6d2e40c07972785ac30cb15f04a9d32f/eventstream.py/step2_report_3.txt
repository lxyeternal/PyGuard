  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code and the provided assessments.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code manages SSE connections, threading, and session tokens.\n- Obfuscated class/method names and dynamic URL construction are consistent.\n- No explicit malicious activities (e.g., data exfiltration, system modification, backdoors) are evident.\n- The main concern is obfuscation, which can conceal malicious intent but does not necessarily imply it.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Score:**\n  - Malware: 0.2\n  - Obfuscated: 0.8\n  - Security Risk: 0.4\n- **Analysis:**\n  - Correctly identifies obfuscation and threading practices.\n  - No evidence of malicious behavior.\n  - The high obfuscation score aligns with the code style.\n- **Verdict:**\n  - The score seems reasonable; the malware score is low, reflecting suspicion but no confirmed malicious activity.\n  - **No change needed.**\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Score:**\n  - Malware: 0.2\n  - Obfuscated: 0.8\n  - Security Risk: 0.3\n- **Analysis:**\n  - Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on standard SSE and threading.\n  - No signs of malicious activity.\n  - Obfuscation is high.\n- **Verdict:**\n  - The scores are consistent; no evidence of malware.\n  - **No change needed.**\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Score:**\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0.4\n  - Security Risk: 0.3\n- **Analysis:**\n  - Slightly less obfuscated, but still significant.\n  - No malware detected.\n- **Verdict:**\n  - The malware score is zero, which is appropriate given the analysis.\n  - **No change needed.**\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Score:**\n  - Malware: 0.2\n  - Obfuscated: 0.6\n  - Security Risk: 0.3\n- **Analysis:**\n  - Similar to previous reports, with obfuscation and threading.\n  - No explicit malicious activity.\n- **Verdict:**\n  - The malware score might be slightly high; the report emphasizes obfuscation but finds no malware.\n  - **Suggestion:** Lower malware score to 0.1 or keep at 0.2; the current is acceptable but slightly conservative.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Score:**\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0.6\n  - Security Risk: 0.2\n- **Analysis:**\n  - Similar pattern, with obfuscation and session token handling.\n  - No malicious activity evident.\n- **Verdict:**\n  - Malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n  - **No change needed.**\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- The **obfuscation scores** are high (0.4 to 0.8), which aligns with the code style.\n- The **malware scores** are low (0 to 0.2), reflecting no concrete evidence of malicious behavior.\n- The **security risk scores** are moderate, primarily due to obfuscation and session token handling.\n\n---\n\n### **My final estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0.1** (slightly above zero due to obfuscation but no evidence of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0.7** (high, given the nonsensical class/method names)\n- **Risk score:** **0.3** (moderate, mainly due to obfuscation and session token usage)\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is likely part of a legitimate event streaming client, but its obfuscation and dynamic threading warrant cautious review.\n- No evidence supports classifying it as malware.\n- The scores should reflect low malware risk but acknowledge obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always recommend further review of related code, especially how session tokens are managed and whether obfuscation is justified or malicious.",
