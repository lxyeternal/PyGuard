  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the presence of issues, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Issue Presence:** The code is obfuscated, with nonsensical class and method names, which is suspicious. It manages SSE connections, threads, and queues, but no explicit malicious actions are evident.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** The method `SvnTWONkkNEraXOpsMSJpbqWLLOyzJqT` appears to be an obfuscated or typo method, possibly intended to clear the queue. This is suspicious but not necessarily malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0.2, Risk 0.4, Obfuscated 0.8. These seem reasonable given the obfuscation but lack concrete malicious activity.\n- **Justification:** Obfuscation is high, but no direct malware is observed. The risk score is moderate, reflecting suspicion but no confirmed threat.\n\n**Recommendation:** Keep scores as is; obfuscation warrants caution but not high malware risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Issue Presence:** Similar obfuscation, session token used in SSE connection, threading for event and heartbeat, but no malicious activity.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** The method `SvnTWONkkNEraXOpsMSJpbqWLLOyzJqT` again suspicious; possible obfuscation or typo.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0.2, Risk 0.3, Obfuscated 0.8. These are consistent with the analysis.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malware; obfuscation is high, but the code appears to be a standard event client.\n\n**Recommendation:** Scores are appropriate; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Issue Presence:** Obfuscated class/method names, session token in URL, but no malicious activity.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** No significant flaws; standard SSE connection with session token.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Risk 0.3, Obfuscated 0.8. These are reasonable.\n- **Justification:** No malware signs; obfuscation remains high but seems to be a standard API client.\n\n**Recommendation:** Keep scores as is.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Issue Presence:** Obfuscated names, suspicious queue method `SvnTWONkkNEraXOpsMSJpbqWLLOyzJqT`, but no explicit malicious actions.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** Similar obfuscation and dynamic threading, which could hide malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0.2, Risk 0.3, Obfuscated 0.6. Slightly lower obfuscation score than others; acceptable.\n- **Justification:** No evidence of malicious activity, but obfuscation warrants cautious scoring.\n\n**Recommendation:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Issue Presence:** Obfuscated class/method names, session token in URL, no malicious activity.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** Use of obfuscation, but no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Risk 0.2, Obfuscated 0.6. Appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malware detected; obfuscation is present but not necessarily malicious.\n\n**Recommendation:** Keep as is.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- All reports identify obfuscation and standard SSE connection management.\n- No explicit malicious activity (data exfiltration, system modification, malicious network communication) is evident.\n- The obfuscation and dynamic threading are suspicious but not conclusive of malware.\n- The scores assigned reflect these observations well.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:**  \n- Given the consistent obfuscation but no evidence of malicious actions, I would **lower** the malware score slightly from 0.2 or 0.0 to **0.1** overall, considering the potential for concealment but lack of concrete malicious behavior.\n\n**Obfuscated score:**  \n- The high obfuscation scores (0.6–0.8) are justified. I agree with the current scores.\n\n**Risk score:**  \n- The overall risk, considering obfuscation and potential concealment, should be **around 0.4**. This aligns with the cautious approach but acknowledges no confirmed malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my final estimates:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Estimate |\n|----------------|----------------|\n| Malware        | **0.1**        |\n| Obfuscated     | **0.8**        |\n| Security Risk  | **0.4**        |\n\n**Note:** The high obfuscation warrants ongoing monitoring, but current evidence does not justify higher malware or risk scores.",
