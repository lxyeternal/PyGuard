  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, albeit obfuscated, SDK for managing Arlo devices. It contains security concerns related to credential handling and obfuscation but shows no active malicious behavior or payloads. The low malware score (~0.15) and moderate security risk (~0.35) are justified. The obfuscation score (~0.75) reflects the code's intentionally complex naming and structure. Overall, it is a benign SDK with security hygiene issues rather than malware or sabotage."
