  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup configuration, including package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file, package metadata variables, dependency list.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no network, file, or environment variable output.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' content; setting package metadata; listing dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names (e.g., MjidDNjlcccYfNvBnTuRAuZlczgxHsTg), lack of comments, and some obfuscated-like variable names. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code segments detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It defines a function to read the README.md file, which is a common practice for long description. The setup() call specifies package name, modules, version, dependencies, classifiers, and other metadata. No code execution, network activity, or hidden behaviors are present. The obfuscated variable names may indicate an attempt to disguise intent, but they are used solely for package configuration without malicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard package setup with obfuscated variable names but no malicious or suspicious behavior. No malware, data leaks, or security risks are evident from this code fragment.",
