  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for a Python package, including reading a README file and specifying dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file within the function MjidDNjlcccYfNvBnTuRAuZlczgxHsTg().",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data output or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "The function reads the README.md content during setup; no other data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable and function names (e.g., MjidDNjlcccYfNvBnTuRAuZlczgxHsTg), which appear obfuscated or randomly generated; no actual malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with an obfuscated function name that reads a README file. The setup() call contains typical package metadata and dependencies. No suspicious code, data leakage, or malicious behavior detected. No external inputs are processed at runtime that could be exploited. The obfuscated function name might suggest an attempt to conceal intent, but it only reads a local file.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate setup configuration with obfuscated naming, which could be an attempt to hide code but does not execute malicious actions. No malware or security risks identified.",
