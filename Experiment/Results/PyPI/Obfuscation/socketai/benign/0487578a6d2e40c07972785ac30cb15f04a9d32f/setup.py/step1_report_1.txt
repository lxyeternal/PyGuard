  "purpose": "Define setup configuration for a Python package including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks where untrusted data is used or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Data flows from reading 'README.md' into the long_description return value, used in setup; dependencies are listed statically.",
  "anomalies": "Function name 'MjidDNjlcccYfNvBnTuRAuZlczgxHsTg' appears obfuscated; no other suspicious code behavior. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, or network activities detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package, using 'setuptools'. The only function reads a 'README.md' file for description content. The function name appears intentionally obfuscated but does not impact security. All dependencies are listed explicitly. No network calls, no code injection, no data leaks or backdoors are evident. No signs of malware or malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard package setup script with obfuscated naming but no malicious or suspicious behavior. No malware or security risks detected based on the provided code.",
