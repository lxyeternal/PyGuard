  "purpose": "Define setup configuration for a Python package named 'ku4nwmkljoga3be4'.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file within the function MjidDNjlcccYfNvBnTuRAuZlczgxHsTg().",
  "sinks": "Potentially None directly; however, the use of setup() could lead to package installation behaviors.",
  "flows": "Reading description from 'README.md' (source) and passing dependency list to setup() (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated function name 'MjidDNjlcccYfNvBnTuRAuZlczgxHsTg' and obfuscated variable 'tCLgYgpGQCgLkCccNtmJaZHhsJgxklaF' which may hide intent. No clear malicious behavior but indicates potential obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function with a non-descriptive, obfuscated name that reads from 'README.md', then calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. The dependencies include common libraries. The obfuscated naming could be an attempt to hide malicious intent or simply a form of obfuscation. No suspicious network activity or malicious code is evident. The code appears to perform standard package setup tasks, with no external data flows or injections. However, the obfuscation warrants caution, as it might mask malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script primarily performs package setup with obfuscated function and variable names, which could suggest an attempt to conceal malicious intent. There are no clear signs of malware or malicious activity, but the obfuscation should be reviewed further if part of a larger context.",
