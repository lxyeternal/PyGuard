  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python project, defining package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; imports dependencies listed in 'GmJgSSCGqZRSRapzOjijLUtgaMFhKamP'.",
  "sinks": "No suspicious data sinks or external network interactions; no untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Reads description from file, passes metadata to setup() function; no dynamic or external data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function name 'MjidDNjlcccYfNvBnTuRAuZlczgxHsTg' and variable 'tCLgYgpGQCgLkCccNtmJaZHhsJgxklaF='; superficial obfuscation with no malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script with obfuscated identifiers. It performs straightforward file reading and calls setup() with package info and dependencies. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks are present. Obfuscation appears superficial, likely for evasion or stylistic reasons. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated package setup script. No malware or malicious intent is evident. The obfuscation is superficial and does not pose a security threat. The overall security risk is minimal.",
