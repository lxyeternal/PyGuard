      "conclusion": "The code functions as a real-time event streaming client with heartbeat management, employing obfuscation that could conceal malicious intent. No direct evidence of malware or malicious activity is present, but the high obfuscation score and session token handling suggest the need for further review in a secure environment. The overall security risk is moderate, with low malware likelihood but high obfuscation."

      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code is an obfuscated HTTP request wrapper with no direct evidence of malicious activity. The high obfuscation level warrants caution, but the absence of malicious payloads or behaviors suggests it is benign. The suspicious method names and obfuscation could be attempts to conceal malicious code, but based on the provided analysis, it remains a low-risk utility with moderate obfuscation concerns."

      "obfuscated": 0.75,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, albeit obfuscated, SDK for managing Arlo devices. It contains security concerns related to credential handling and obfuscation but shows no active malicious behavior or payloads. The low malware score (~0.15) and moderate security risk (~0.35) are justified. The obfuscation score (~0.75) reflects the code's intentionally complex naming and structure. Overall, it is a benign SDK with security hygiene issues rather than malware or sabotage."
