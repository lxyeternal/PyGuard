{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define two pytest hook specifications, likely intended for plugin development or testing customization.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'geYfLULXLacsuVfWiGAETvBebDmOpfHh' parameter in both functions.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks that process untrusted data or perform insecure operations.",
  "flows": "Data from 'geYfLULXLacsuVfWiGAETvBebDmOpfHh' flows into the functions but is not used further; functions return static strings.",
  "anomalies": "The function names are obfuscated and do not follow standard naming conventions. The variables are assigned static strings but are unused. The functions do not perform any meaningful computation or output.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two pytest hook specification functions with obfuscated names and parameters. The functions return static strings and do not execute any logic involving the parameters. There are no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, system modification, or network activity. The obfuscated names could suggest an attempt to hide intent, but they are harmless in context. No suspicious code execution, external calls, or insecure behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless, minimal pytest plugin skeleton with obfuscated identifiers. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident.",

  "obfuscated": 0.8,
