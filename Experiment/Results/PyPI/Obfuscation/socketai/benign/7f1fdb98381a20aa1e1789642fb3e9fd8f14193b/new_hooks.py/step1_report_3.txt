  "purpose": "Define two pytest hook specifications with obfuscated function names and local string variables.",
  "sources": "Function definitions and local string variables within each function",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that process untrusted input or output data; functions only assign strings to variables",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; functions do not perform any data processing or output",
  "anomalies": "Unusual function names that appear obfuscated and do not conform to typical pytest hook specifications; local variables contain seemingly random strings but are unused",
  "analysis": "The code defines two pytest hook specification functions with obfuscated names and parameters. Both functions assign fixed strings to local variables but do not perform any other operations, data processing, or network activity. The use of obfuscated names and the lack of meaningful logic could be suspicious, but in this context, it appears to serve no malicious purpose. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code execution. The functions do not invoke external systems or handle untrusted data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is suspicious primarily due to obfuscated function names and unused variables, which could indicate an attempt to hide intent. However, there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior or malicious payloads. It appears to be an intentionally obscure or placeholder code with no malicious activity.",
