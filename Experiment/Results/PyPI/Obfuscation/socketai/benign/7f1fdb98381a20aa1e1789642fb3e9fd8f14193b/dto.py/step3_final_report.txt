{
  "purpose": "Define a data structure for storing test case results, including status, duration, and representations.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries, pytest internal modules, and a constants module; class attributes initialized with test result data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only defines a data container without external data handling.",
  "flows": "Data flows from imported modules into class attributes; no runtime data processing or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of private pytest modules and obfuscated-looking constant names; unusual naming conventions but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward dataclass with no runtime logic, external system calls, or data processing. The obfuscated names and internal module imports are typical in testing contexts or generated code. No signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration are present. The import of private modules and constants with non-descriptive names could be suspicious but are common in internal testing frameworks. The malware score is 0, risk is very low (~0.1), and obfuscation is moderate (~0.2), reflecting superficial obfuscation rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard test result data structure with superficial obfuscation and internal module imports. No evidence of malware or security risks; scores are appropriately low. It can be considered safe for use.",
