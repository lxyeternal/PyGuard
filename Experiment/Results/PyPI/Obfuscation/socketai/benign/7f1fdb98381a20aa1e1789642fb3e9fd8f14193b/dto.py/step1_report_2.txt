{
  "purpose": "Define a data class for representing test case results or statuses within a testing framework.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries, third-party pytest modules, and a constants module. No user input or external data read directly.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data flows involving untrusted input; no data is written to external sources or systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; data class just defines structure and types.",
  "anomalies": "The import of a constant with a seemingly random name from an external module could be suspicious, but it is not inherently malicious. The rest of the code is standard data class definition.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a data class with several fields, including strings, a float, and an imported constant type. Imports are from standard and third-party libraries used in testing frameworks. No dynamic code execution, data leakage, or suspicious logic is present. The import of a strongly obfuscated constant name from an external module is unusual but not malicious. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward data structure definition for test results.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data class setup for testing purposes with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The presence of an obfuscated constant import is suspicious but not malicious in itself. Overall security risk is low.",
