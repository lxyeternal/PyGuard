{
  "purpose": "Define a data structure (dataclass) to store test case information for a testing framework or report generator.",
  "sources": "Import statements from standard library, third-party libraries, and a constants module; class attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data sources or external system interactions present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code solely declares a data structure with no runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated-looking class and variable names, but no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The constant import appears unusual but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party modules, including pytest components, and defines a dataclass with several fields. No code execution, input handling, or external data processing occurs. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or system modifications are present. The naming conventions are unconventional, potentially obfuscating intent, but this alone does not imply maliciousness. The class is purely a data holder with no functions or methods executing logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward dataclass definition for storing test result data. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The unusual naming could be a form of obfuscation but does not indicate malware. Overall, it appears safe.",
