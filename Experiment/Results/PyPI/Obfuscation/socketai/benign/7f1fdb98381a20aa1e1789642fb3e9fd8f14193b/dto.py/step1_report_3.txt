  "purpose": "Define a dataclass for storing test case result information within a testing framework.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries and pytest, constants, and class attributes.",
  "sinks": "No clear sink points where untrusted data flows to system-level actions or outputs.",
  "flows": "No significant data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of internal or private modules (_pytest._code.code), large and seemingly random attribute names, and importing constants with obfuscated names could be suspicious. However, they may also be legitimate for a test framework.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several modules, including private pytest modules and a constants module with an obfuscated name. It defines a dataclass with attributes that seem related to test case metadata, including test identifiers, status, duration, and detailed representations. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. The use of private modules and obfuscated constants could suggest either intentional encapsulation or an attempt to hide malicious intent, but within the context of test frameworks, this is not uncommon. No network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard data structure used for test result reporting within a testing framework, with no evident malicious behavior or security risks. The use of private modules and obfuscated constants is likely legitimate given the context, although it warrants caution if extracted from untrusted sources.",
