  "conclusion": "The assessments across reports are consistent and justified. Report 2's high obfuscation and dynamic execution features justify a slightly elevated malware score (~0.5). The other reports correctly indicate low malicious activity. Overall, the code appears benign with some caution warranted where obfuscation and dynamic execution are involved, but no confirmed malicious payloads are present."
