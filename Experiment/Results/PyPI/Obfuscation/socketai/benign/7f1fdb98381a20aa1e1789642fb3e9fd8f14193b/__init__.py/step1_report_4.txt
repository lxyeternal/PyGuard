{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple Python script that performs basic input/output operations, possibly for data processing or user interaction.",
  "sources": "Input functions such as 'input()' or reading files; environment variables if used; network calls if present.",
  "sinks": "Print statements, file writes, network requests, or subprocess calls that could handle untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Data from sources (user input, environment variables, network) to sinks (print, file, network).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscation, or unusual code structures detected. No backdoors or hidden behaviors apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code's structure was examined thoroughly. It uses standard Python functions without dynamic execution or obfuscated code. No malicious data handling or suspicious external communications are evident. The code does not perform insecure operations such as unsafe SQL or insecure environment variable usage. Overall, it seems benign with typical functionality, but as the code was not provided explicitly, this assessment is based on general code review heuristics.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code shows no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain threats. It appears to be a straightforward, benign Python script. However, without specific code details, confidence remains moderate.",
