{
  "purpose": "Define enumerations and constants for status and results, possibly for a testing or monitoring framework.",
  "sources": "Constants and enum definitions; dictionary mappings between enums and strings or integers.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks for untrusted data or potential data leak points; no external data handling or output shown.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code primarily establishes static mappings and enums.",
  "anomalies": "Use of non-descriptive variable names, but these seem to be obfuscated or autogenerated. No hardcoded secrets or credentials found. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious activity evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several enum classes with obfuscated or auto-generated names and values, along with dictionaries mapping enums to other values. No user input handling, network operations, or external data processing is present. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious logic. The naming style and structure suggest either obfuscated or autogenerated code, but nothing malicious is evident. The code appears to be a static configuration or status mapping.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It appears to be static configuration or enumeration definitions with no active or risky operations.",
