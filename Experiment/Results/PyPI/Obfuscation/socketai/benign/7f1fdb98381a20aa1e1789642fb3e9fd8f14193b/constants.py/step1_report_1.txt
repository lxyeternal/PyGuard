{
  "purpose": "Define enums and dictionaries for categorization and status tracking, likely for testing or reporting purposes.",
  "sources": "Enum class definitions, dictionary initializations, variable assignments.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks for untrusted input or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code mainly sets static mappings and enum values.",
  "anomalies": "Use of nonsensical variable names; no actual user input, network operations, or data handling shown; no hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code contains enum definitions with arbitrary identifiers and string/numeric values, along with static dictionaries mapping enum members to other enum values or strings. The naming appears intentionally obfuscated or nonsensical, but there is no evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. The structure is consistent with configuration or status tracking. No suspicious operations or security risks are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign set of enum and dictionary definitions with obfuscated variable names, but no malicious intent or security threats are identifiable. It does not perform any harmful actions or data leaks. Overall, it is low risk.",
