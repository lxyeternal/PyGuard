  "purpose": "Static configuration and categorization data using enums and dictionaries with obfuscated variable names.",
  "sources": "Enum class definitions, static dictionaries, variable assignments",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, no data leaks, no external system interactions",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static data only",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, no functions or dynamic code, static data structures",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of enum definitions, static dictionaries, and variable assignments with obfuscated names. There are no functions, input handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The static nature and lack of external interactions suggest it serves as configuration or categorization data. No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities are present. The obfuscation appears to be a stylistic or protective measure rather than an indicator of malicious intent. The malware score is appropriately set to 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2). The obfuscation score is high (~0.75), reflecting the nonsensical variable names. Overall, the code is benign, static, and obfuscated only in naming, with no malicious activity or security threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static, obfuscated configuration module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The assigned scores are consistent with the analysis, and no further action is necessary.",
