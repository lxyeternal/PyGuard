{
  "purpose": "Define enumerations and constants, likely for test status and categories.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string values, enum definitions, dictionary initializations.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted input or data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code primarily static definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names; no input handling; no external data or network activity; no suspicious code patterns. No secrets, backdoors, or hidden behaviors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of enum class definitions with seemingly random, obfuscated variable names. It creates static dictionaries mapping enum members to other enum members or string values. No dynamic code execution, no input processing, and no external data handling are present. The structure appears to be for status tracking or categorization, with no evident malicious intent. The absence of network, file, or environment variable operations indicates no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign, primarily defining enums and constants with obfuscated variable names. There are no signs of malicious activity, data leakage, or supply chain threats. It is likely a part of a larger codebase where these definitions are used for logical processing.",
