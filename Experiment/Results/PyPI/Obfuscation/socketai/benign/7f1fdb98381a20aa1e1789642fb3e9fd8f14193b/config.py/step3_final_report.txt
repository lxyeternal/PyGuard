  "purpose": "Configuration class for pytest-TestRail integration, loading options and environment variables.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (TR_RUN_ID, TR_API_URL, TR_USER_EMAIL, TR_USER_PASSWORD, TR_PROJECT_ID, TR_SUITE_ID) and pytest options (--tr-reporting, --tr-deselect-tests, --tr-tb).",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data flows leading to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and pytest options supply data to class attributes; assertion ensures critical variables are present.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and class names; no malicious code or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward configuration loader with obfuscated identifiers, reading sensitive info from environment variables, and asserting their presence. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or malicious actions are present. Obfuscation may be for concealment but does not imply malicious intent. The use of environment variables for secrets is standard but requires secure handling. The assert statement enforces presence of critical variables, which is good practice. Overall, the code appears benign, with no signs of malware or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical configuration setup with obfuscated names, no malicious behavior, and low security risk. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated ~0.75, risk=0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
