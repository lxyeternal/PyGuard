      "conclusion": "The assessments across reports are consistent and justified. Report 2's high obfuscation and dynamic execution features justify a slightly elevated malware score (~0.5). The other reports correctly indicate low malicious activity. Overall, the code appears benign with some caution warranted where obfuscation and dynamic execution are involved, but no confirmed malicious payloads are present."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard pytest plugin setup for TestRail with obfuscated identifiers. No evidence of malicious activity or security risks is present. The primary concern is obfuscation, which could be used to hide malicious intent, but in this context, it appears to be a concealment tactic rather than malicious code. Scores are consistent with the analysis; ongoing monitoring and source review are recommended."

The primary concern is obfuscation, which hampers readability but does not imply malicious intent. Security risks are low, and the code does not pose an immediate threat."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate pytest extension primarily for test result processing and reporting. Its main security concern is the use of pickle serialization, which should be reviewed and possibly replaced with safer alternatives. There is no evidence of malware or malicious behavior. The overall security risk is moderate due to serialization practices, but the code itself appears benign."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The reports are generally consistent and justified. The high malware and obfuscation scores in the suspicious code are appropriate, while absence of code warrants low scores. Slight adjustments could be made to reflect moderate suspicion in some cases, but overall, the scoring aligns with the evidence."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code demonstrates a critical security vulnerability due to unsafe deserialization of untrusted data with pickle, combined with obfuscation. The pattern is indicative of potential malicious behavior or at least a severe security risk. The high scores assigned in the reports are justified, and this code should be refactored to eliminate unsafe pickle usage and improve code clarity."
