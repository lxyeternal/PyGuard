  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a specific function related to data processing or system interaction, but the exact goal cannot be determined without seeing the actual code.",
  "sources": "Data sources include environment variables, user input, external files, or network connections. Specifics cannot be identified without code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network transmissions, file writes, subprocess executions, or system calls. Exact locations are not identifiable without code.",
  "flows": "Data flow involves data originating from sources and potentially reaching sinks, possibly through intermediate variables or function calls. Details are unavailable without code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies can be detected without reviewing specific code sections. Need to examine the code for hardcoded secrets, suspicious patterns, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "Insufficient information provided to analyze code content. Cannot identify sources, sinks, or flows without code snippets. Cannot evaluate anomalies or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "Unable to determine malicious behavior or security risks due to lack of code. Cannot confirm or deny the presence of malware or vulnerabilities without code review.",
