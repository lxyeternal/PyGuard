{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script with no immediately apparent malicious intent; it likely performs a specific utility or function.",
  "sources": "Input data may come from function parameters, environment variables, or external modules imported; however, without explicit input handling, no clear data sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file operations, or subprocess calls, but none are explicitly present in the code provided.",
  "flows": "There are no clear source-to-sink data flows; the code executes operations internally without evident data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are apparent; no obfuscation or unusual language features are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, utilizing standard Python syntax and libraries. It does not include network activity, code injection, or data leakage mechanisms. No malicious behaviors or security risks are detected based on the visible code. The structure is clear, and there are no signs of obfuscation or tampering. Without additional context or hidden payloads, it appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The script seems to serve a legitimate purpose without any suspicious activity. Confidence in this assessment is high.",
