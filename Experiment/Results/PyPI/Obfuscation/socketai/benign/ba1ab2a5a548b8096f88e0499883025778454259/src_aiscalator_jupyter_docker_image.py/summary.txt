  "conclusion": "The code is a typical build automation script with obfuscation but no malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. The high obfuscation scores reflect variable name concealment, not malicious intent. The overall security risk is low, and malware score is zero. The code warrants standard review practices, mainly to ensure input validation in dynamic commands."
