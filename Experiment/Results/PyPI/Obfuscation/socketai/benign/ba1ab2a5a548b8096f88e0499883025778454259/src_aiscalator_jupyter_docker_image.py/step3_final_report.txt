{
  "purpose": "The code automates Docker image building, including copying files, installing packages, managing extensions, tagging images, and cleaning up build artifacts.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration fields, file contents, environment variables, and external files for extension paths and Dockerfile modifications.",
  "sinks": "Executes subprocess commands for Docker build/tag, pip install, file copying/replacing, and cleanup operations.",
  "flows": "Source data from configuration and files flows into subprocess commands and file modifications, culminating in Docker image creation and tagging.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of heavily obfuscated variable names, dynamic command construction, and comments that suggest code concealment; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard Docker build automation tasks with obfuscated variable names, which impair readability but do not inherently indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials, network communications, or payloads are present. The obfuscation may serve concealment or code generation purposes. Potential input validation issues exist due to dynamic command construction, but no evidence of malicious payloads or sabotage is found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical build automation script with obfuscation but no malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. The high obfuscation scores reflect variable name concealment, not malicious intent. The overall security risk is low, and malware score is zero. The code warrants standard review practices, mainly to ensure input validation in dynamic commands.",
