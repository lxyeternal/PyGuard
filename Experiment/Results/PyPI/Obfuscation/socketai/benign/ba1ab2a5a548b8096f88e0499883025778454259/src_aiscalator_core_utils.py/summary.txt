  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of utility functions with obfuscated variable names but no evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, or active threats. The heavy obfuscation warrants caution but does not imply malicious intent. The malware score is 0, and the overall security risk is low (0.2). The functions are standard for automation and resource management, and no suspicious behavior is detected."
