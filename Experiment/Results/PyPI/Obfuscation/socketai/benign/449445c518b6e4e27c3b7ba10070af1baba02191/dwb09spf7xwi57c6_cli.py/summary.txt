  "conclusion": "The script functions as a legitimate CLI tool for device control with notable obfuscation in the imported module. There is no direct evidence of malware or malicious behavior; however, the obfuscated import should be verified for integrity and source. The overall security risk is moderate due to potential concealment, but the malware likelihood remains low."
