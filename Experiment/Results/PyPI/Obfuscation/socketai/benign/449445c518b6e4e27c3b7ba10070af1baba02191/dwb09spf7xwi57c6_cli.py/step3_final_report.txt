  "purpose": "CLI tool for controlling IKEA IDÅSEN desk, managing configurations, pairing, and commands via Bluetooth or network interactions.",
  "sources": "Configuration files, command-line arguments, device MAC address discovery, environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Configuration files, stdout/stderr logs, device control commands, potential network communication via device SDK.",
  "flows": "User input and CLI commands flow into device control functions, configuration updates, and device pairing processes.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious obfuscated import module 'VooiqoHdGugEsbpRiKKMoolwcOPhGNCQ', complex async functions, variable names, and some undefined variables (e.g., 'IDASEN_CONFIG_PATH', 'height', 'speed').",
  "analysis": "The code appears to implement a CLI for IKEA IDÅSEN desk control, including configuration management, device pairing, and status commands. The main concern is the obfuscated import 'VooiqoHdGugEsbpRiKKMoolwcOPhGNCQ', which could be a legitimate SDK or a concealed malicious module. No evidence of malicious payloads, network exfiltration, or backdoors is present. The code structure is complex but aligns with device control operations. The obfuscation and complex async logic warrant further investigation of the imported module, but based on the current analysis, no malicious activity is confirmed.",
  "conclusion": "The script functions as a legitimate CLI tool for device control with notable obfuscation in the imported module. There is no direct evidence of malware or malicious behavior; however, the obfuscated import should be verified for integrity and source. The overall security risk is moderate due to potential concealment, but the malware likelihood remains low.",
