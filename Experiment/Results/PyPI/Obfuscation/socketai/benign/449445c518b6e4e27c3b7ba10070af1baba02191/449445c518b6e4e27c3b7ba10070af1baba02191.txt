      "conclusion": "The script functions as a legitimate CLI tool for device control with notable obfuscation in the imported module. There is no direct evidence of malware or malicious behavior; however, the obfuscated import should be verified for integrity and source. The overall security risk is moderate due to potential concealment, but the malware likelihood remains low."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate BLE device control module with superficial obfuscation and no malicious intent. The primary issue is a runtime bug due to an undefined variable, which should be fixed. No evidence suggests malware or malicious sabotage."
