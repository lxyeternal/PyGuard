  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, obfuscated API client with no evident malicious activity. Obfuscation and dynamic URL formatting warrant caution but do not confirm malicious intent. Malware scores are appropriate; obfuscation scores are justified; overall security risk remains moderate. Further analysis would be needed to definitively rule out malicious behavior, but based on current evidence, the code appears benign."
