  "purpose": "API client setup with SSL context, token-based authentication, and dynamic URL formatting, with obfuscated class and function names.",
  "sources": "API_PATH['tunes'].format(...) calls, token input for headers, SSL context creation.",
  "sinks": "Network requests using httpx clients, headers containing tokens, URL formatting for API endpoints.",
  "flows": "Token and URL formatting data flow into network request functions, SSL context used in client setup.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and function names, incomplete URL formatting with empty string parameter, dynamic URL formatting, no explicit validation or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs API clients (sync and async) with obfuscated identifiers, SSL contexts, and token-based headers. No direct malicious payloads or behaviors are evident. Obfuscation and dynamic URL formatting could be used to hide malicious endpoints, but no concrete evidence of malicious activity is present. The low malware scores (0-0.1) align with the absence of malicious payloads. The high obfuscation scores (~0.6-0.7) are justified by the naming conventions. The security risk scores are moderate (~0.3-0.4), reflecting caution due to obfuscation but no active threats. Overall, the code appears to be a standard API client, with obfuscation as the primary concern, but no malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, obfuscated API client with no evident malicious activity. Obfuscation and dynamic URL formatting warrant caution but do not confirm malicious intent. Malware scores are appropriate; obfuscation scores are justified; overall security risk remains moderate. Further analysis would be needed to definitively rule out malicious behavior, but based on current evidence, the code appears benign.",
