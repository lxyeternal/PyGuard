  "conclusion": "The import statements are highly obfuscated but do not demonstrate evidence of malicious behavior based solely on these lines. The scores assigned in the reports are justified and consistent with the evidence. No immediate threat is confirmed, but further investigation of the imported modules is advised to rule out concealed malicious code."
