  "purpose": "Import specific classes or functions from local modules, likely for exception handling and internal utilities.",
  "sources": "Import statements from relative modules: .exceptions and .ngenic",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data flows present in the provided code",
  "flows": "No data flow paths identified, as the code only contains import statements",
  "anomalies": "Imported identifiers appear as obfuscated, nonsensical strings, which may indicate obfuscation or malicious concealment",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward import operations from local modules. The imported names are highly obfuscated or randomly generated, which could be a technique to hide malicious intent or simply an obfuscation method. There are no other code constructs, no function calls, no data processing, and no apparent malicious behavior in these import statements alone. The absence of additional code limits the context, but based solely on these lines, no malicious activity can be confirmed. The use of obfuscated identifiers warrants caution, as it might be an attempt to hide malicious code elsewhere in the package.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists solely of import statements with obfuscated identifiers, which could be suspicious but are not inherently malicious. No direct malicious behavior is evident from these lines alone; however, obfuscation warrants further review of the entire package.",
