{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific functions or classes from local modules, likely for exception handling and other functionalities within the package.",
  "sources": "Import statements sourcing from internal modules: .exceptions and .ngenic.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present; these are purely import statements.",
  "flows": "No data flows or data processing present; only module imports.",
  "anomalies": "The imported identifiers appear as obfuscated or intentionally scrambled names, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code only consists of two import statements from local modules, referencing functions or classes with obfuscated names. There is no evidence of data leakage, malicious behavior, or security risks. The obfuscated names could be for code hiding or obfuscation purposes but do not indicate malicious intent by themselves. No external network activity, credential handling, or dangerous constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is limited to internal module imports with obfuscated names. No malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks are identified based on these lines. The obfuscated identifiers alone do not suggest malicious intent, but they warrant further context for confirmation.",
