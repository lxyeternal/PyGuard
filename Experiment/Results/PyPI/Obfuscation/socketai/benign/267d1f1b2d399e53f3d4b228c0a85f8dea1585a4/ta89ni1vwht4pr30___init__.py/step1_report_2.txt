  "purpose": "Import specific classes or functions from local modules 'exceptions' and 'ngenic'.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing specific classes/functions from relative modules.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no data processing or output occurs in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows; only import statements.",
  "anomalies": "Imports are using non-descriptive, obfuscated names, which could be an attempt to hide intent. The code is highly minimal and does not reveal any malicious behavior directly.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific symbols from relative modules. The imported names appear to be obfuscated, which can sometimes indicate malicious intent or code concealment. However, with only import statements and no further logic, it is not possible to determine malicious behavior from this snippet alone. No external data sources, network activity, or suspicious operations are visible.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet only performs obfuscated imports, which could be used to conceal malicious logic in other parts of the project. On its own, it does not demonstrate malicious behavior but warrants caution due to the obfuscation. Further context is needed to assess fully.",
