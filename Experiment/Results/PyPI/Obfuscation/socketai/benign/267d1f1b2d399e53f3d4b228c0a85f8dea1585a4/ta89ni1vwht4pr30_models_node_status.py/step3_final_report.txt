  "purpose": "Calculates battery and radio status percentages based on internal attributes, with logging for specific conditions.",
  "sources": "Internal data attributes such as 'maxBattery', 'battery', 'maxRadioStatus', 'radioStatus', and '_parent_node_uuid'.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data leaks; calculations are internal, and logging outputs are benign.",
  "flows": "Data flows from internal attributes to percentage calculations within methods; no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of class and method names; no malicious code or secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward percentage calculations based on internal data attributes, with logging for specific conditions. Obfuscated naming is present but does not indicate malicious intent. No external network, file, or malicious behavior is evident. Malware scores are zero, and security risk scores are low (~0.2), consistent with benign, simple calculations. Obfuscation is notable but not malicious, and no anomalies or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing simple internal calculations with obfuscated identifiers. No malicious activity or security risks are present. Obfuscation warrants caution but does not indicate malicious intent. Scores should remain with malware at 0, obfuscation around 0.6, and risk at 0.2.",
