  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing simple internal calculations with obfuscated identifiers. No malicious activity or security risks are present. Obfuscation warrants caution but does not indicate malicious intent. Scores should remain with malware at 0, obfuscation around 0.6, and risk at 0.2."
