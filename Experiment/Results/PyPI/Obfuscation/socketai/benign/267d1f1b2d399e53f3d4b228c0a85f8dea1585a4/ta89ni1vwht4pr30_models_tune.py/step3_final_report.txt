{
  "purpose": "API client wrapper for managing 'rooms', 'nodes', and 'setpoint schedules' via HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as UUIDs, boolean flags, and constants like API_PATH for URL formatting.",
  "sinks": "HTTP requests to external API endpoints, data returned from network responses, and response parsing functions.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into URL formatting functions, then into HTTP request methods, with responses processed and returned or used for further logic.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with nonsensical class and method names; dynamic URL formatting; no hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads detected.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as an API client with obfuscated identifiers, making network requests to manage entities like rooms, nodes, and schedules. No evidence of malicious payloads, data exfiltration, or backdoors is present. The obfuscation appears deliberate, likely to conceal the code's purpose, but does not inherently indicate malicious intent. The network interactions are standard, and the code does not perform any suspicious operations such as system modifications or unauthorized data access.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated API client with no signs of malicious activity. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware and malicious behavior are not evident. The overall security risk remains low, primarily due to obfuscation, which warrants cautious review but does not confirm malicious intent.",
