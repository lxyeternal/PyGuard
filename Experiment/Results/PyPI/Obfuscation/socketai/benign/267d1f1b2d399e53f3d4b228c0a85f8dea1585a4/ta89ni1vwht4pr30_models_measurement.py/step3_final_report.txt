  "purpose": "Defines measurement types and a class for handling measurement data with an HTTP client.",
  "sources": "Initialization parameters for measurement type, class constructor reading json_data",
  "sinks": "Method returning measurement type; no untrusted data sinks evident",
  "flows": "Constructor assigns measurement type; method retrieves it",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of variable and class names; no malicious code or network activity",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, involving an enum and a class that manages measurement data. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is detected. The obfuscation of names is notable but not inherently malicious. The class initializes with an HTTPX AsyncClient, JSON data, and a measurement type, providing a getter method. Overall, the code appears benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with high obfuscation but no malicious activity. The malware score is 0, the obfuscation score is justified at 0.6 due to naming obfuscation, and the security risk is low at 0.2. No changes are necessary.",
