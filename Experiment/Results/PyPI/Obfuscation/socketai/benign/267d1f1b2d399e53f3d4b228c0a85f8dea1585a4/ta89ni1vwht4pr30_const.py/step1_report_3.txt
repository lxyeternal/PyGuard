  "purpose": "Define constants for API URL and endpoint paths for use in an application",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string assignments for API URL and endpoint paths",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points; constants are static",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; constants are used as configuration",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behavior; usage of type annotations is standard",
  "analysis": "The code sets up immutable constants for API configuration, which is typical for client configuration data. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets beyond the API URL, and no data input/output operations are present. The endpoint paths are parameterized but stored as string templates, which is standard practice. There are no signs of malicious code, data leakage, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration setup for API endpoints with no malicious intent or security risks.",
