  "purpose": "Define constants for API URL and endpoint paths used in a larger application for interacting with a remote service.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string for API_URL and dictionary for API_PATH.",
  "sinks": "Potentially any use of these constants in network requests or data handling; however, the code itself does not perform such actions.",
  "flows": "Not applicable as the code only defines constants; no data flow occurs within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code structures; usage of type hints and Final annotations are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code declares immutable constants for API endpoints using Python's Final type hint. It uses string formatting placeholders in URL templates, which is typical for constructing API requests. No input reading, no network activity, no obfuscated code, and no signs of malicious behavior are present. The code appears to be a straightforward configuration or constants definition for API interaction.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, safe configuration snippet defining API endpoints with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
