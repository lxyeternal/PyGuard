  "purpose": "Define constants for API URL and API endpoint paths for use in a Python application.",
  "sources": "Assignment of API_URL and API_PATH constants; no external data input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output involving untrusted data; only defining static constants.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is purely static definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of type annotations with Final for constants is standard; no unusual or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a base API URL and a dictionary of endpoint paths with string formatting placeholders. It uses Python's typing.Final to indicate immutability. There are no dynamic executions, external data inputs, or operations that could be exploited maliciously. No obfuscated code or suspicious constructs are present. The code appears to be a straightforward configuration setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, static configuration of API endpoint constants with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It appears to be intended for use in an API client.",
