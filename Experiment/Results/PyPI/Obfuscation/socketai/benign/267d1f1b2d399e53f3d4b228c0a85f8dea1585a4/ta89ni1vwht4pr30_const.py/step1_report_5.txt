  "purpose": "Define constants for API URL and API endpoint paths for a service related to 'ngenic.se'.",
  "sources": "Assignment of API_URL and API_PATH with static string data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data processing or external output occurring.",
  "flows": "None; code only defines constants without processing user input or external data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'Final' type hints is normal; no suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes immutable configuration constants for API endpoints, which is typical in API client modules. No input sources, no data flows, and no sinks are present. No hardcoded credentials or sensitive data are evident. The code is straightforward and well-structured, with no signs of malicious or maliciously obfuscated logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code only defines API endpoint constants with no malicious intent or security concerns. It appears to be a standard configuration setup.",
