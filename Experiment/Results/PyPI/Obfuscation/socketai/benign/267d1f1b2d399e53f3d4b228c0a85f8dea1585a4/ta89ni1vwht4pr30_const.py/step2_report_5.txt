  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code consists solely of defining constants for API URLs and endpoint paths.\n   - There are no dynamic operations, no input/output handling, no external calls, and no obfuscation.\n   - The use of `Final` and type annotations is standard and indicates immutability.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning:**\n   - The reports uniformly state that the code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious behavior.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is static configuration, with no data flows or suspicious patterns.\n   - No logical errors or flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0`, and `obfuscated: 0`, which is consistent with the code's nature.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, which seems reasonable given the clarity of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The code does not perform any network activity, data processing, or dynamic behavior.\n   - No secrets, credentials, or sensitive data are present.\n   - The code is purely static configuration.\n   - Therefore, a risk score higher than 0.5 is unwarranted.\n\n5. **Malware Score:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports.\n   - This is correct; there is no malicious activity or code.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they stick to the facts.\n   - The code is standard and has no suspicious patterns.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n- The code is a simple, static configuration snippet defining API constants.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior is present.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My Final Estimate:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nThis code is benign and standard for configuration purposes. The reports are accurate and consistent. No changes to the scoring are necessary.",
