  "purpose": "Define constants for API endpoint URL and paths for use in a Python application.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded string values for API URL and endpoint paths.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code only defines static constants.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code is purely defining constants.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'Final' hints at immutability but is standard; no anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'Final' from 'typing' to define immutable constants for API URL and path templates. It assigns a fixed URL string to API_URL and a dictionary of endpoint templates to API_PATH. The structure is straightforward and uses standard Python syntax without dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. No input reading, no data processing, and no external calls are present. The code's intent appears to be configuration or constants setup for an API client.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard definition of constants for API endpoints. There is no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and no security risks detected.",
