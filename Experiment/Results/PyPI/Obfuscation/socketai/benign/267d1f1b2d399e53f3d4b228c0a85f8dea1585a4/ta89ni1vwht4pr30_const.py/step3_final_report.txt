  "purpose": "Define static API endpoint URLs and path templates for use in an API client.",
  "sources": "Static string assignments for API_URL and API_PATH dictionary.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks as code is static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static constants with no obfuscation or dynamic code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of immutable constant definitions for API URLs and endpoint paths, using standard Python syntax and type annotations. There are no dynamic operations, input handling, or network activity. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code serves as configuration data for an API client. Given its static and benign nature, there are no security risks or malicious behaviors. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are justified and consistent with the code's characteristics.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration module defining API endpoints. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The scores and assessments in the reports are accurate and appropriate.",
