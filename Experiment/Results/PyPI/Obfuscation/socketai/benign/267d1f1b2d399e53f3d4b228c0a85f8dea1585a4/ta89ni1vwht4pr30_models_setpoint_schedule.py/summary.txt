  "conclusion": "The code appears to be schedule management with heavy obfuscation. There is no evidence of malware or malicious intent. The suspicious datetime method and obfuscation should prompt further review, but current analysis does not confirm malicious activity. Scores should reflect high obfuscation (around 0.8), low malware likelihood (around 0.2), and moderate security risk (around 0.4)."
