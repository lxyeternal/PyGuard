  "purpose": "Schedule management with obfuscated code, parsing ISO timestamps, and interacting with external APIs.",
  "sources": "Reading 'startTime', 'endTime', 'name' fields; external API endpoints for setpoint schedules.",
  "sinks": "API calls, data assignments to schedule fields, potential network interactions.",
  "flows": "Input fields ('startTime', 'endTime') parsed into datetime objects, used to update schedule state, then sent via API calls.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of class/method names; suspicious datetime method 'datetime.wGJvFvyfRCkPDmzhzSYqlrXtTNPRGXRu' which is invalid; broad exception handling suppressing errors.",
  "analysis": "The code manages schedule objects, parsing ISO format times, updating internal state, and making API calls. Obfuscated variable and method names hinder analysis. The datetime usage appears invalid or obfuscated, indicating potential obfuscation or errors. No hardcoded secrets or explicit malicious network activity are evident. Broad exception handling could hide errors or malicious manipulations. The repeated suspicious datetime method suggests obfuscation or typo, warranting caution. Overall, no concrete malicious activity is detected, but obfuscation and inconsistent datetime handling are concerning.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be schedule management with heavy obfuscation. There is no evidence of malware or malicious intent. The suspicious datetime method and obfuscation should prompt further review, but current analysis does not confirm malicious activity. Scores should reflect high obfuscation (around 0.8), low malware likelihood (around 0.2), and moderate security risk (around 0.4).",
