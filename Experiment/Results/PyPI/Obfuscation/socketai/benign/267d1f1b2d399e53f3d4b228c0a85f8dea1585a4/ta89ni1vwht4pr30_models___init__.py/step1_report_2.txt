  "purpose": "Import specific modules or classes from local packages within a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "Import statements that access internal modules or classes: .base, .room, .setpoint_schedule, .tune.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data are present; these are standard import statements.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; these are static import statements without data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "Imported symbols have obfuscated or nonsensical names, which is unusual and may be suspicious. No actual code execution or dynamic behavior is visible.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of four import statements from relative modules within a package. The imported class or object names are long, random-looking strings, which could indicate obfuscation or autogenerated names. No code execution, data input, or external data handling is present. The import pattern itself is standard and does not, by default, indicate malicious behavior, but the obfuscated names warrant further scrutiny in context.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs straightforward relative imports with obfuscated names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or malicious code within these statements. However, the obfuscated names may suggest an attempt to hide or confuse, which should be verified in the broader context. Based solely on these lines, the risk is low.",
