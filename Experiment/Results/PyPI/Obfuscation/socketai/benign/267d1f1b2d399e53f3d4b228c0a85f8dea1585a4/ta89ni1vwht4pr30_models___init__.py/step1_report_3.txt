  "purpose": "Import modules or components from relative package paths, likely part of a larger Python package or library.",
  "sources": "Relative imports from internal modules: .base, .room, .setpoint_schedule, .tune",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no data output, network communication, or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Imports are static and do not process untrusted data; no source-to-sink data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "All imported identifiers are non-descriptive, seemingly obfuscated or generated names, which could indicate attempt to hide code intent. No other unusual code present.",
  "analysis": "The code only performs static relative imports with obfuscated module names. No functions, data processing, or dynamic code execution is present. The use of seemingly random or hashed names for modules may suggest code hiding or obfuscation, but without additional code, no malicious behavior is evident. The imports themselves are standard Python syntax, with no suspicious operations or behaviors. Since no actual code beyond imports is shown, the risk assessment is limited to the import patterns and naming conventions.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code consists solely of obfuscated relative import statements with no evident malicious behavior or security issues. The naming pattern could be an attempt to hide module purposes but does not by itself indicate malicious intent. No active malicious behavior detected.",
