  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes with hardcoded class variables, possibly for categorization or obfuscation.",
  "sources": "Class variable assignments and __init__ method in the third class.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data flow to external systems or outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink; class variables are static and not used in a way that affects untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class and variable names; class variables contain nonsensical strings; __init__ method unnecessarily calls super().__init__ with self and msg, which is unconventional.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three exception classes, inheriting from each other, with obfuscated class and variable names. The class variables hold static strings that seem arbitrary. The __init__ method in the third class incorrectly calls super().__init__(self, msg), which does not follow typical Python exception patterns and could indicate obfuscation or intentional complexity. No external input handling, network activity, or sensitive operations are present. The code appears to be deliberately obfuscated but lacks malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists of obfuscated class definitions with static strings and unconventional exception initialization. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data theft, network communication, or backdoors. It appears to be intentionally obscured but harmless.",
