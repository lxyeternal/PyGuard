{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes with obfuscated attribute names, likely for error handling or internal logic.",
  "sources": "No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are read.",
  "sinks": "No sensitive sinks, data leaks, or network interactions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only defines classes and variables.",
  "anomalies": "Class attribute names are obfuscated strings, which could be an attempt to hide intent. The constructor calls super() incorrectly by passing 'self' as an argument, which is not standard and may lead to errors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three classes inheriting from Exception. The first class has an obfuscated class variable. The second class inherits from the first and adds another obfuscated class variable. The third class inherits from the first and correctly implements an __init__ method, but the call to super().__init__() incorrectly includes 'self' as an argument, which is a mistake in Python 3. The obfuscated attribute names suggest an attempt to hide the code's purpose. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The main concern is the improper use of super().__init__() in the third class, which might cause runtime errors rather than malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be an obfuscated attempt to define custom exceptions, possibly to evade easy analysis. There is no evidence of malicious intent or malware. The improper use of super().__init__() is a coding error but not malicious. Overall, the code has low security risk and no malware indicators.",
