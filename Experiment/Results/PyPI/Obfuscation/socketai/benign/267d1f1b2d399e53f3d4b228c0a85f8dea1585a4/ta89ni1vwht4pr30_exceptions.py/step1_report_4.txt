  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes with obfuscated attribute names.",
  "sources": "Class attribute initializations and constructor with message parameter.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data flow to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow; exception class hierarchy does not process untrusted data in a harmful way.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated class and variable names, which could hide malicious intent but appear to be just obfuscation. No actual malicious code, backdoors, or harmful behavior is present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three exception classes, each inheriting from the previous, with obfuscated attribute names containing static strings. The constructor stores a message, but there is no execution of external data, no code injection, no network activity, or other suspicious behaviors. The obfuscation appears to be an attempt to hide intent but does not seem malicious on its own.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be intentionally obfuscated but does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It solely defines custom exceptions with obfuscated attribute names and a basic constructor. No malware or malicious intent is evident.",
