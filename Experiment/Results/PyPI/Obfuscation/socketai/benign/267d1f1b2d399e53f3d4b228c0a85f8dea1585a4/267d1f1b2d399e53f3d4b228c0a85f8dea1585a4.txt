      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, obfuscated API client with no evident malicious activity. Obfuscation and dynamic URL formatting warrant caution but do not confirm malicious intent. Malware scores are appropriate; obfuscation scores are justified; overall security risk remains moderate. Further analysis would be needed to definitively rule out malicious behavior, but based on current evidence, the code appears benign."

The improper super() call is a coding error, not malicious. The overall security risk is very low, and the scores assigned in the reports are appropriate."

The suspicious datetime method and obfuscation should prompt further review, but current analysis does not confirm malicious activity. Scores should reflect high obfuscation (around 0.8), low malware likelihood (around 0.2), and moderate security risk (around 0.4)."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing simple internal calculations with obfuscated identifiers. No malicious activity or security risks are present. Obfuscation warrants caution but does not indicate malicious intent. Scores should remain with malware at 0, obfuscation around 0.6, and risk at 0.2."

      "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated API client with no signs of malicious activity. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware and malicious behavior are not evident. The overall security risk remains low, primarily due to obfuscation, which warrants cautious review but does not confirm malicious intent."

The obfuscation of module names warrants further review of the actual module contents, but the current scores and assessments are appropriate. The code appears benign but should be monitored if additional context reveals malicious behavior."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated API client wrapper with no direct evidence of malware or malicious activity. The obfuscation raises concerns about transparency but appears to be a styling or code protection measure rather than malicious sabotage. The malware score remains at 0, and the security risk is moderate (~0.3) mainly due to obfuscation and code complexity. Further review of the full codebase is recommended, but based on this fragment, it is considered benign."
