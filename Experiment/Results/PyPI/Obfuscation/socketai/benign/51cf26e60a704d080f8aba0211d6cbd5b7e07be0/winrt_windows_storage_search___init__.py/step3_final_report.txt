{
  "purpose": "Static enum definitions and module imports with obfuscated identifiers, likely auto-generated or for internal use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'winrt' modules and enum class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data flows, input handling, or system modifications present.",
  "flows": "None; code is purely declarative with no active data or control flow.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of class and enum names, but no malicious code or behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and enum class definitions with obfuscated names. There are no functions, data processing, network activity, or system modifications. The obfuscation appears to be a deliberate attempt to conceal the purpose but does not imply malicious intent. Malware scores are appropriately zero; security risk scores are low (~0.2), reflecting the static and benign nature of the code. No active logic or data flows suggest any security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, mainly boilerplate or auto-generated with obfuscated identifiers. No evidence of malware, vulnerabilities, or malicious intent is present. The obfuscation may serve internal or proprietary purposes but does not pose a security threat in this context.",
