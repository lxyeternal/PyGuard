  "conclusion": "The code functions as a spatial/directional configuration parser with significant obfuscation. No evidence of malicious behavior or malware is detected. The high obfuscation score reflects concealment, but the malware score remains zero. The security risk is low, though caution is advised due to obfuscation. Overall, the code appears benign but warrants further source verification if from untrusted origins."
