  "purpose": "Parser class generated by ANTLR for a custom language or data format involving directives, annotations, directions, regex, and virtual pins.",
  "sources": "TokenStream input, primarily reading tokens via LA(1) and getToken methods.",
  "sinks": "Internal token processing; no external data leaks, network calls, or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Source tokens are read and matched within parser rules; no external communication or data exfiltration occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of class and method names typical of generated parser code; no malicious patterns or suspicious code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a complex, auto-generated parser class with multiple nested rule contexts. It performs lookahead checks, token matching, and rule transitions. No external data sources, network activity, or system modifications are present. Obfuscation is consistent with parser generator output, not malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic are identified. The code strictly handles syntactic parsing, with no signs of malicious behavior such as data theft, remote control, or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated parser with obfuscated identifiers. It performs syntactic analysis without any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The obfuscation is typical for generated parser code and does not imply malicious intent. The malware score is 0, the security risk score is low (~0.2), and the obfuscation score is high (~0.7), which are consistent with the code's nature.",
