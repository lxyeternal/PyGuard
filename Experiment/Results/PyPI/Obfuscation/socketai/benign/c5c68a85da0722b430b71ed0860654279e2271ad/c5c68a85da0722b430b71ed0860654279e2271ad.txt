      "conclusion": "The code is benign, likely auto-generated parser scaffolding with obfuscated names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation level is moderate to high but typical for generated code, and it does not pose a security threat in this context."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated parser with obfuscated identifiers. It performs syntactic analysis without any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The obfuscation is typical for generated parser code and does not imply malicious intent. The malware score is 0, the security risk score is low (~0.2), and the obfuscation score is high (~0.7), which are consistent with the code's nature."

      "conclusion": "This code is a standard, auto-generated ANTLR lexer with obfuscated internal data. It exhibits no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The obfuscation and large serialized automaton are typical for such generated components. The security risk is minimal, and the code can be considered safe."

      "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign in isolation but suspicious due to obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious activity or data leakage. The high obfuscation scores are justified, but without additional context, the code cannot be definitively labeled malicious. The current scores and assessments are appropriate and consistent with the observed code."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code functions as a spatial/directional configuration parser with significant obfuscation. No evidence of malicious behavior or malware is detected. The high obfuscation score reflects concealment, but the malware score remains zero. The security risk is low, though caution is advised due to obfuscation. Overall, the code appears benign but warrants further source verification if from untrusted origins."
