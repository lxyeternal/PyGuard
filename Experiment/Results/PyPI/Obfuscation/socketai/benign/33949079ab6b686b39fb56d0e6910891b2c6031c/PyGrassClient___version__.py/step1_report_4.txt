  "purpose": "Store metadata information about the Python package 'PyGrassClient', including its name, description, repository URL, version, author, contact email, and license.",
  "sources": "No actual data input sources; only hardcoded string assignments.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points; no data processing or network communication observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; all are simple string assignments.",
  "anomalies": "All variables are assigned static string values; no suspicious or obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable assignments with static strings representing package metadata. There are no indications of code injection, data leakage, or malicious activity. No external inputs, network calls, or secret operations are present. The structure is straightforward and typical for metadata definitions.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It appears to be simple package metadata declarations with no suspicious elements.",
