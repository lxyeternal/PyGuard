{
  "purpose": "Store metadata about the Python package 'PyGrassClient', including its name, description, repository URL, version, author, contact email, and license.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string assignments at the beginning of the code",
  "sinks": "No dynamic data handling, user input, or untrusted data sources present",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only assigns static values",
  "anomalies": "All variables contain hardcoded strings; no obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, no suspicious variable names beyond simple metadata",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable assignments with static strings representing package metadata. No external inputs, no network calls, no file operations, and no suspicious logic. The data appears to be package information, typical for a setup or metadata file. No indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leakage mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, containing only package metadata with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears to be a standard metadata declaration for a Python package.",
