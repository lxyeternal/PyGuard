  "purpose": "Static package metadata declarations for the PyGrassClient Python package, including name, description, URL, version, author, email, and license.",
  "sources": "Assignment of static string variables containing package name, description, URL, version, author, email, and license.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input, external data handling, or untrusted data processing present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static metadata assignments do not involve data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of dynamic code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors; code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments with package metadata. No functions, data flows, external inputs, or dynamic behaviors are present. The code is clear, non-obfuscated, and contains no malicious payloads or suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence (1). The scores are consistent with the static, metadata-only content. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are detected. Given the evidence, the code poses no security threat or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely static package metadata with no malicious or suspicious elements. All assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate. The code does not pose any security risks or supply chain threats.",
