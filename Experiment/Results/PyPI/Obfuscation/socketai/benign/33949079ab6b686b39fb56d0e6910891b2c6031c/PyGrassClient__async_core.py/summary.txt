  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated, proxy-supporting WebSocket client capable of covert communication. While no explicit malicious payloads are present, its structure, obfuscation, and hardcoded server details suggest potential malicious intent, such as command-and-control or data exfiltration. Caution is advised, and further analysis of external dependencies and runtime behavior is recommended."
