      "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup configuration with a known pattern of loading version info via exec(). No malicious code or malware is detected. The main security consideration is ensuring the integrity of the version file. Scores are appropriate; malware=0, obfuscated=0.2-0.4, risk=0.3. It is advisable to replace exec() with safer alternatives to eliminate potential execution risks."

      "conclusion": "The code appears benign in isolation, with no malicious activity detected. The obfuscation of identifiers raises suspicion but is not definitive proof of malicious intent. The scores assigned are appropriate, and further investigation of the module's contents is advised to ensure safety."

      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code appears to be utility functions with obfuscated naming, primarily benign but with potential misuse if proxies are maliciously supplied. No direct malware or malicious payloads are evident. The main risk stems from unvalidated proxy input and obfuscation, which could be exploited in a broader attack context. Overall, the code warrants cautious handling but does not demonstrate malicious behavior."

      "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated, proxy-supporting WebSocket client capable of covert communication. While no explicit malicious payloads are present, its structure, obfuscation, and hardcoded server details suggest potential malicious intent, such as command-and-control or data exfiltration. Caution is advised, and further analysis of external dependencies and runtime behavior is recommended."

      "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated and logs sensitive information, which are security concerns. However, there is no concrete evidence of malicious payloads or malicious behavior in static analysis. The malware score remains low, but the obfuscation and poor security practices justify a moderate security risk. Further dynamic analysis is recommended to confirm behavior."
