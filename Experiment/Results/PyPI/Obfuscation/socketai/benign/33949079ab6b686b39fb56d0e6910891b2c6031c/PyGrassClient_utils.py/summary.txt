  "conclusion": "The code appears to be utility functions with obfuscated naming, primarily benign but with potential misuse if proxies are maliciously supplied. No direct malware or malicious payloads are evident. The main risk stems from unvalidated proxy input and obfuscation, which could be exploited in a broader attack context. Overall, the code warrants cautious handling but does not demonstrate malicious behavior."
