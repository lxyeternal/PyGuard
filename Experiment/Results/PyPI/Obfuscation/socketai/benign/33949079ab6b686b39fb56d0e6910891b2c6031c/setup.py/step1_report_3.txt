{
  "purpose": "This code sets up a Python package distribution, reading necessary metadata from files and executing a version file to include version info.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md', 'requirements.txt', and a version file '__version__.py'; uses 'exec' to run code from '__version__.py'.",
  "sinks": "The 'exec' call executes code from an external file, which could potentially be malicious if the file is tampered with.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the version file ('__version__.py') through 'exec' into the setup process; other data flows are from static file reads into variables for setup.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'exec' on an external file is unusual and risky, especially if the file contents are not controlled or verified, which could lead to code execution vulnerabilities.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical setup operations for a Python package, including reading metadata and dependencies. The key concern is the use of 'exec' on the '__version__.py' file, which can execute arbitrary code if the file is compromised or maliciously altered. There are no other suspicious behaviors such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The rest of the code is standard for packaging, with no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The main security concern is the use of 'exec' on a version file, which could be exploited if the file is maliciously modified. Otherwise, the code appears to be a typical setup script with no signs of malware or malicious behavior.",
