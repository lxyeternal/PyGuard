  "purpose": "Standard setup script for a Python package, reading metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md', 'requirements.txt', and executing '__version__.py' to load version info.",
  "sinks": "Execution of external file '__version__.py' via exec(), which could run malicious code if the file is compromised.",
  "flows": "Reading the version file content and executing it with exec(), then passing the loaded data to setup().",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on an external file; variable names are obscure, but not necessarily malicious; no network activity or obfuscation beyond variable naming.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with a known security pattern involving exec() to load version info. No signs of malicious behavior or malware are present. The main concern is the potential for executing tampered code if '__version__.py' is compromised. Variable names are obscure but not intentionally obfuscated for malicious purposes. The malware score remains at 0, reflecting no malicious activity. The security risk score is moderate (~0.3), due to exec() usage, which is common but risky if the version file is untrusted. Obfuscation is minimal; variable names are confusing but not malicious. Overall, the code is standard, with a minor security concern that can be mitigated by replacing exec() with safer import methods.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup configuration with a known pattern of loading version info via exec(). No malicious code or malware is detected. The main security consideration is ensuring the integrity of the version file. Scores are appropriate; malware=0, obfuscated=0.2-0.4, risk=0.3. It is advisable to replace exec() with safer alternatives to eliminate potential execution risks.",
