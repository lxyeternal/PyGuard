  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup configuration with a known pattern of loading version info via exec(). No malicious code or malware is detected. The main security consideration is ensuring the integrity of the version file. Scores are appropriate; malware=0, obfuscated=0.2-0.4, risk=0.3. It is advisable to replace exec() with safer alternatives to eliminate potential execution risks."
