  "purpose": "Import specific obfuscated functions or classes from a module within the PyGrassClient package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'PyGrassClient._core' module.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data handling, user input, or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "The imported functions/classes are available for use elsewhere; no data flow analysis is possible from this snippet alone.",
  "anomalies": "Imports obfuscated names which could indicate attempts to hide malicious intent, but this alone is not definitive. No other suspicious code or behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports three symbols with non-descriptive, obfuscated names from a submodule, which could be a tactic to conceal malicious functions. The rest of the code declares an export list with non-obfuscated, understandable identifiers. There are no further operations, data handling, or behaviors shown in this snippet. Lack of context limits full assessment, but nothing explicitly malicious is evident here.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet appears to perform a standard import with obfuscated names, potentially hiding malicious intent, but there is no concrete evidence of malicious behavior or security risks based solely on this. The code is minimal and lacks direct harmful actions.",
