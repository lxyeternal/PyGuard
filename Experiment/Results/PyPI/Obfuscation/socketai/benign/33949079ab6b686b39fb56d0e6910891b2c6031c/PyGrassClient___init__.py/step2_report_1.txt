  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports focus on the same code snippet: a set of import statements from a private module with obfuscated identifiers, and an `__all__` list exposing certain names.\n- The code itself is minimal and appears to be a straightforward import/export declaration.\n- The primary concern across reports is the obfuscated nature of the imported identifiers, which could be an attempt at hiding malicious code or simply obfuscation for other reasons.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious behaviors such as network activity, file manipulation, or data leaks.\n- The imported symbols are obfuscated, which could be suspicious but isn't inherently malicious.\n- The code is minimal; no actual logic or data flow is present in this snippet.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:\n- The reports correctly identify the obfuscation as a potential concern but do not overstate it.\n- They appropriately note the absence of malicious activity within this fragment.\n- Some reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the lack of evidence for malicious behavior.\n- The security risk scores vary slightly but are generally low, which is reasonable given the minimal code.\n\n### Score analysis:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified; no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Ranges from 0.4 to 0.8, reflecting suspicion due to obfuscated identifiers.\n- **Risk score:** Mostly low (around 0.2 to 0.4), which is appropriate given the limited context.\n\n### Justification for higher scores:\n- The reports do **not** assign high risk or malware scores because there's no evidence of malicious intent.\n- The obfuscation alone, without further context, warrants caution but does not justify high scores.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores seem reasonable given the evidence.\n- The main concern is the obfuscation, which should prompt further review of the actual `_core` module contents.\n- No changes are necessary unless additional context suggests malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** around 0.6 (moderate suspicion due to obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** around 0.2-0.3 (low, given no evidence of harm)\n\n**In conclusion:**\nThis code snippet appears to be a standard import/export setup with obfuscated identifiers. While obfuscation can be suspicious, there's no concrete evidence of malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary based on the provided information.\n\n**Further action:**\n- Review the `_core` module's actual implementation to ensure the obfuscated functions are safe.\n- Confirm whether the obfuscation is intentional for security or privacy reasons or an attempt to conceal malicious code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign in isolation.\n- Obfuscation warrants caution but is not proof of malicious intent.\n- Scores are reasonable; no significant changes needed.",
