  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated and logs sensitive information, which are security concerns. However, there is no concrete evidence of malicious payloads or malicious behavior in static analysis. The malware score remains low, but the obfuscation and poor security practices justify a moderate security risk. Further dynamic analysis is recommended to confirm behavior."
