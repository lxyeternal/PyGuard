{
  "purpose": "Define a set of common English stopwords for text processing.",
  "sources": "The code creates a set containing a list of stopwords, which is a static data structure hardcoded directly into the script.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or untrusted data outputs are present; the code does not process or output data dynamically.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input to untrusted output. The code is static and does not perform any data manipulation or transfer.",
  "anomalies": "The set includes duplicate entries, such as 'a', 'about', 'above', 'after', etc., which are listed multiple times; however, this is benign and does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials, environment variables, network connections, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a static set of stopwords for text processing, a common and harmless operation. The duplication of entries appears accidental and does not pose security issues. No dynamic execution, network activity, or sensitive data handling is present. The code appears to be straightforward, standard, and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a simple data definition of stopwords with no malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain any malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious activity. The presence of duplicates is benign and does not affect security.",
