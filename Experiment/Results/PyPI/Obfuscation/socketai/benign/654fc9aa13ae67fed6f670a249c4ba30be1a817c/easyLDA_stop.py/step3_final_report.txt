  "purpose": "Static list of stopwords used for text processing, with no dynamic behavior or external data.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it defines a static set of words.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static data without external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "Duplicate entries in the stopword set; no malicious or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static set of stopwords, common in NLP tasks. The only notable aspect is the duplication of entries, which is likely accidental and harmless. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code does not interact with external data, network, or system resources. The assigned scores in the reports (malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0) are consistent with the benign static nature of the code. The high confidence scores reflect certainty in the benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static list of stopwords with minor duplication. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
