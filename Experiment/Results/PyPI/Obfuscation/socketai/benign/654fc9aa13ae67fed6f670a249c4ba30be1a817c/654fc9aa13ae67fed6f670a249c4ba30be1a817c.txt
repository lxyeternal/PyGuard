      "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with obfuscated variable names and an external data download during installation. No malicious payloads or behavior are detected. The main concern is the external download, which could be exploited if the source is compromised, but as-is, it appears intended for legitimate NLP functionality."

      "conclusion": "The code shows red flags due to obfuscation but lacks evidence of malicious activity or security risks. The malware score should be low, with a moderate obfuscation score, and minimal security risk. The overall assessment indicates benign behavior with caution warranted due to obfuscation."
