  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that installs dependencies and downloads NLTK stopwords during installation.",
  "sources": "Reading README file, calling nltk.download('stopwords') during setup",
  "sinks": "External network activity during setup (nltk.download call)",
  "flows": "Setup process initiates reading README and downloading stopwords",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and class names, download of external data during setup",
  "analysis": "The code obfuscates variable names and performs a standard package setup. It includes a custom install class that downloads NLTK stopwords during installation, which is unconventional but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious network activity are present. The obfuscation reduces code clarity but does not imply malicious intent. The external download poses a potential security concern but is common in NLP packages. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0.7, and security risk score is approximately 0.2-0.3, reflecting the unconventional setup behavior but no malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with obfuscated variable names and an external data download during installation. No malicious payloads or behavior are detected. The main concern is the external download, which could be exploited if the source is compromised, but as-is, it appears intended for legitimate NLP functionality.",
