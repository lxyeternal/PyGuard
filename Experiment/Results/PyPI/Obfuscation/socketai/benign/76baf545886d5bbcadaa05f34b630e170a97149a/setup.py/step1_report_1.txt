{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package with Rust integration via cargo, and reads a README.md file for package description.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.md file and possibly executes external commands (cargo build).",
  "sinks": "The code does not appear to process untrusted input data directly or write data to external locations based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No explicit flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the only file operation is reading a local README.md file, which is benign.",
  "anomalies": "Use of non-standard import 'ilGuQOKsbpcbPhDZppGiRuKniJAETCRN' from os, which is suspicious as it resembles obfuscated or random naming. The variable names throughout are random or nonsensical, indicating potential obfuscation. The code contains no comments, and some string literals appear to be base64 or obfuscated, but no actual decoding or malicious activity is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code sets environment variables and calls external build commands (cargo), which is typical for Rust-Python integrations. The unusual import and variable names, and the absence of any evident malicious logic, suggest obfuscation rather than malicious intent. There are no indicators of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The script performs standard package setup tasks with some obfuscated naming, possibly to hide the true purpose, but no malicious behavior is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a package setup script with obfuscated variable and import names. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks are evident. The obfuscation may be intended to hide the true purpose but does not by itself indicate malicious intent.",
