{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a Python wrapper around a native 'omikuji' machine learning library, providing model loading, training, prediction, and configuration functionalities.",
  "sources": "Reads file paths, environment variables, and untrusted input during model loading and prediction functions.",
  "sinks": "Writes model files, saves data, and interacts with native library functions; no network or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input flows into native functions via file paths and encoded strings; data flows from input sources into native library calls for model operations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of ffi.gc, complex or nonsensical variable names suggesting obfuscation, but no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python wrapper interfacing with a native library for model management. It employs standard patterns such as ffi.gc for memory management and provides methods for model loading, saving, training, and prediction. The variable naming complexity indicates obfuscation but does not imply malicious intent. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are evident. The reliance on external native code introduces some supply chain risk, but within this code, there is no evidence of sabotage or malware. The obfuscation scores are justified by variable naming, and the malware scores are appropriate at zero given the absence of malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, albeit obfuscated, wrapper around a native machine learning library. There is no evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious activity. The primary concern is verifying the integrity of the native library itself. The current scores—malware: 0, obfuscated: 0.7, risk: 0.2—are consistent with the analysis.",
