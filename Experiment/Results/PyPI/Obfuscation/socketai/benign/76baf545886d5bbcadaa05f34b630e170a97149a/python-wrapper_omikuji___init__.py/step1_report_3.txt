{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a wrapper and interface for a native library related to 'omikuji' models, including loading, saving, training, and predicting with models.",
  "sources": "Input data includes function parameters such as data paths, model identifiers, and feature/value lists. Environment variables are not explicitly used.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include file operations (saving/loading models), external library calls, and data prediction outputs. The code does not directly leak data but interacts with external files and native libraries.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (like data paths or model names) into library functions for loading or training models, and outputs are generated from prediction functions. No suspicious flow of untrusted data to external networks is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. The code utilizes native library calls with potentially opaque behavior. The use of ffi.gc for memory management appears standard. No suspicious dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or backdoors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a Python interface for a native C/C++ library, handling model loading, saving, training, prediction, and thread pool management. It employs standard patterns such as ffi.gc for memory safety and dynamically initializes thread pools. No signs of malicious behavior, such as network communication, system manipulation, or data exfiltration, are present. All data handling appears confined to file and model operations via external library calls. There are no anomalies indicating obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a wrapper for a native 'omikuji' model library, with standard design patterns and no suspicious or malicious behaviors detected. It primarily manages models and predictions through external C/C++ library functions, with no evidence of malware or security risks within this module.",
