{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for a Python package, defining dependencies and package metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads package dependencies and configuration parameters from variables and the setup() function arguments.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks are present; the code does not process external input or execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "The setup() function uses predefined variables to configure package installation; no data flows from external sources to sinks are evident.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are heavily obfuscated, which is unusual and could be a red flag for concealment, but no malicious code or suspicious behavior is directly observable.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names. No malicious code, network activity, or data exfiltration is present. The obfuscation of variable names is suspicious but not definitive of malicious intent. The reports provided are empty, offering no additional insights or identified issues. The overall structure appears syntactically correct and typical for package configuration. Given the lack of evidence for malicious activity, the risk and malware scores should remain low, with a moderate obfuscated score due to naming practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign package setup script with obfuscated variable names. No malicious behavior or vulnerabilities are evident. The empty reports do not suggest any issues. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not confirm malicious intent. Overall, the package is considered safe based on current information.",
