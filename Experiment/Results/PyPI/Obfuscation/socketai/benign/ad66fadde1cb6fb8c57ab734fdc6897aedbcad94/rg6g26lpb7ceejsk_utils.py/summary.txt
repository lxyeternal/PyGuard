  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard environment management utility with significant obfuscation but no evidence of malicious behavior or payloads. The main security consideration is ensuring input validation to prevent command injection. The malware score remains low, obfuscation is notable but not malicious, and the overall risk is moderate due to potential misuse if inputs are untrusted."
