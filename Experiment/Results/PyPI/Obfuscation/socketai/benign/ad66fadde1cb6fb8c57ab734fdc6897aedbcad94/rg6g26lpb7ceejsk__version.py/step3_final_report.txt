{
  "purpose": "Assign a version string to a variable with an obfuscated name, likely for internal or stylistic reasons.",
  "sources": "No external sources; the code is a direct assignment statement.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "N/A; simple assignment without data flow or external interaction.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable name; no malicious or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to an obfuscated variable name. No inputs, outputs, network calls, or data processing are involved. The variable name's obfuscation could be stylistic or part of a larger obfuscated codebase but does not indicate malicious intent. The string '0.3.1' is a typical version identifier. All evidence points to benign behavior with no signs of malware, data leaks, or malicious activity. The obfuscation score could be slightly higher due to the variable name but remains moderate, and the malware and security risk scores are appropriately low.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, simple variable assignment of a version string with an obfuscated variable name. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, security risk, or data leakage. The obfuscation appears superficial and does not imply malicious intent in this isolated snippet.",
