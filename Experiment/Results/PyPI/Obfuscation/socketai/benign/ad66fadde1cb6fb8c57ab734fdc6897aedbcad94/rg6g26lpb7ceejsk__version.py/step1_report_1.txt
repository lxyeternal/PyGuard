  "purpose": "The code appears to define a version string for a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "Assignment operation assigning a string to a variable",
  "sinks": "None, as there are no data leaks or untrusted data processing",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from source to sink beyond variable assignment",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable name that resembles obfuscated or random naming, but no malicious activity detected",
  "analysis": "The code only contains a variable assignment of a version string. No input, no data processing, no external calls, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The variable name is unconventional but not inherently malicious. No signs of obfuscation or malware are evident. The code is straightforward and likely serves as a version indicator.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple assignment of a version string with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
