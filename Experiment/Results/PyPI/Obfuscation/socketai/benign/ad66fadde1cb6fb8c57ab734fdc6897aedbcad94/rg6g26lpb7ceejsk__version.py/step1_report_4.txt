{
  "purpose": "The code assigns a string '0.3.1' to a variable named rDXwRyLowVXrNDwitHllnDrMiixFqjvX.",
  "sources": "Assignment operation to the variable rDXwRyLowVXrNDwitHllnDrMiixFqjvX.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data output points detected.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to other parts of the code; simple variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Variable name appears obfuscated; no other code present to analyze further.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single line that assigns a version string to an obfuscated variable name. There are no inputs, outputs, network calls, or malicious code constructs present. The variable name may suggest obfuscation, but without additional context, it appears harmless. The string '0.3.1' likely denotes a version number, possibly of the package or component.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward variable assignment with an obfuscated variable name and no malicious behavior detected. It is likely part of a larger codebase, but on its own, it presents no security risks.",

  "obfuscated": 0.7,
