      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign package setup script with obfuscated variable names. No malicious behavior or vulnerabilities are evident. The empty reports do not suggest any issues. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not confirm malicious intent. Overall, the package is considered safe based on current information."

      "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard environment management utility with significant obfuscation but no evidence of malicious behavior or payloads. The main security consideration is ensuring input validation to prevent command injection. The malware score remains low, obfuscation is notable but not malicious, and the overall risk is moderate due to potential misuse if inputs are untrusted."

      "obfuscated": 0.8,
      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code is a complex dependency management utility with high obfuscation but no direct evidence of malicious behavior. The primary concern is obfuscation and potential misuse of dependency replacements, which could be exploited if inputs are malicious. The malware score is low, and the obfuscation score is high, with a moderate security risk. No active malicious actions are detected, but the code should be reviewed carefully before deployment in sensitive environments."
