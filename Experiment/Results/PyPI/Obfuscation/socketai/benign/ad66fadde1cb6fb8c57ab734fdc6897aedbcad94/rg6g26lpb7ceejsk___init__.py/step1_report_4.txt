  "purpose": "Import statements for package versioning, utility functions, and dependencies setup.",
  "sources": "Variables with obfuscated names assigned string literals; import statements from local modules and external dependencies.",
  "sinks": "Import statements potentially importing malicious or unintended modules or functions, especially with wildcard imports.",
  "flows": "Obfuscated variables assigned strings -> imports of modules and functions -> potential execution if imported code is malicious.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names and wildcard imports which can conceal malicious code or unnecessary imports.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with two variables assigned simple string literals, which are benign. It then performs multiple import statements, including wildcard imports. The variable names (e.g., TWSzGQfSyBjjNnodgxBnfNCPrHlOYrWB) and module names (e.g., _version, utils, dependencies) are either obfuscated or non-descriptive, which can be a technique to hide malicious intent. Wildcard imports (_call_command, from utils import *) can obscure what is imported, possibly importing malicious or unnecessary code. Overall, there is no direct malicious activity evident in this snippet, but the obfuscation and import practices can be suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to perform standard import operations but employs obfuscation and wildcard imports that could conceal malicious code. There are no explicit malicious actions or anomalies indicating active malware, but the structure warrants caution due to potential concealment tactics.",
