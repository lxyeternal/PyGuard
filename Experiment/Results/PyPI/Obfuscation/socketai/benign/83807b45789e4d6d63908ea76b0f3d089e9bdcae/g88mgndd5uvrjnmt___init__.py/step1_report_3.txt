  "purpose": "Assigning a version string to a variable, likely for version control or package management.",
  "sources": "The string assignment operation; no external input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to external systems or outputs.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows present.",
  "anomalies": "The variable name appears random and obfuscated; no meaningful context or documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a variable assignment with a string value that resembles a version number. There are no external inputs, no function calls, and no suspicious constructs. The variable name appears arbitrary and possibly obfuscated, but this alone does not indicate malicious intent. There are no code injection points, network calls, or data leaks present. The minimal code does not perform any harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple variable assignment of a version string with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscated variable name alone is insufficient to infer malicious intent.",
