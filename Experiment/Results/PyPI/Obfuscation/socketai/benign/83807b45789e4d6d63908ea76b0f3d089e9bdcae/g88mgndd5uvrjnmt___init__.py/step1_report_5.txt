  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable name that appears obfuscated; no apparent malicious activity",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single line assigning a version string to a variable with a complex, non-descriptive name. There are no inputs, outputs, or data flows. The variable name appears obfuscated but is used only for storing a static string. No external data, network activity, or malicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a simple version assignment with obfuscated variable naming. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
