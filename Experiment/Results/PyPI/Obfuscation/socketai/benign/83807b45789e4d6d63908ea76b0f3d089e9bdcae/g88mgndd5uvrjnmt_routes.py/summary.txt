  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit explicit malicious activity or payloads but employs obfuscation that could hide malicious intent. The low malware score aligns with the absence of malicious indicators, while the high obfuscation score reflects the nonsensical naming. The overall security risk is moderate due to obfuscation and minimal validation, which could be exploited if misconfigured. Continuous review and validation are recommended, especially for external server methods and websocket inputs."
