{
  "purpose": "Manages terminal sessions, including creation, deletion, and websocket communication, within an in-memory terminal registry.",
  "sources": "User inputs, terminal IDs, websocket permissions, shared TERMINALS dict, external server method calls.",
  "sinks": "Logs, terminal objects, websocket accept and cleanup, shared TERMINALS state.",
  "flows": "User or websocket data flows from input through terminal management functions, affecting TERMINALS state and websocket interactions.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of variable and class names (e.g., 'PTEuSAXuFdFRFgwtVXeVErsAEXLyrjHr'), minimal validation, dynamic terminal IDs, no explicit validation or security checks.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard terminal session management with websocket handling, but uses heavily obfuscated identifiers, which could be an attempt to conceal malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, network exfiltration, or malicious payloads are evident. The obfuscation and minimal validation could pose risks if misused, but as-is, the code appears benign. External server methods are invoked but outside this fragment's scope. The websocket interactions are standard, with proper accept and cleanup procedures. Overall, the code's behavior is consistent with typical session management modules, with superficial obfuscation that warrants cautious review.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit explicit malicious activity or payloads but employs obfuscation that could hide malicious intent. The low malware score aligns with the absence of malicious indicators, while the high obfuscation score reflects the nonsensical naming. The overall security risk is moderate due to obfuscation and minimal validation, which could be exploited if misconfigured. Continuous review and validation are recommended, especially for external server methods and websocket inputs.",
