  "conclusion": "The code functions as a remote terminal server spawning a bash process, managing websocket I/O, and handling terminal resize commands. Despite heavy obfuscation, there is no evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The obfuscation warrants caution and further review, but the core functionality appears legitimate. Security controls such as input validation and monitoring are recommended before deployment."
