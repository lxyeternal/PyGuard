      "conclusion": "The code implements a remote terminal interface with significant security risks if exposed without proper safeguards. No evidence of malware or malicious payloads is present. Obfuscation and environment variable handling warrant caution, but the overall behavior aligns with a remote terminal server rather than malicious malware."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a simple version assignment with an obfuscated variable name. There is no evidence of malicious intent, data leakage, or security vulnerabilities. The scores across reports are consistent and appropriate, with malware score at 0, obfuscation around 0.7, and risk near 0.1."

      "obfuscated": 0.8,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code functions as a remote terminal server spawning a bash process, managing websocket I/O, and handling terminal resize commands. Despite heavy obfuscation, there is no evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The obfuscation warrants caution and further review, but the core functionality appears legitimate. Security controls such as input validation and monitoring are recommended before deployment."

      "obfuscated": 0.7,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit explicit malicious activity or payloads but employs obfuscation that could hide malicious intent. The low malware score aligns with the absence of malicious indicators, while the high obfuscation score reflects the nonsensical naming. The overall security risk is moderate due to obfuscation and minimal validation, which could be exploited if misconfigured. Continuous review and validation are recommended, especially for external server methods and websocket inputs."

      "security_risk": 0.2,
      "obfuscated": 0.8,
      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code appears to be an obfuscated terminal management component with no concrete evidence of malicious activity. The high obfuscation score is justified, but the malware and security risk scores should remain low. Vigilance is advised, but current analysis indicates a benign purpose."
