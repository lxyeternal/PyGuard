{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the Python package 'ecg_plot' to define metadata and package information for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads content from 'README.md' file to set long_description.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data used in critical operations.",
  "flows": "Reads README.md content as input; no data flows to untrusted sinks or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names such as 'BqSXdiPtLHPxeJTfxDcSNiRPmVxSJIEJ' and 'yTTMEQQChurGLnFWteUfwGOPNUsGmjKy' which do not contribute meaningful context. The code redundantly reads 'README.md' twice. No malicious or suspicious code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' for packaging, reads the README.md file for description content, and calls 'setuptools.setup' with package metadata. The obfuscated variable names are likely placeholder or intentionally obscure but do not perform malicious actions. The redundant reading of the README file is inefficient but not malicious. No external network access, no hardcoded credentials or secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious functions detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a typical setup script for Python packaging with obfuscated variable names but no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
