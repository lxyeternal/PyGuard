  "purpose": "The code is setting up a Python package named 'ecg_plot' with metadata and reading a README file for long description.",
  "sources": [

  "sinks": [

  "flows": [
    "Reading 'README.md' content into variables",
    "Passing the read content into setup() as long_description"
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "Redundant reading of 'README.md' - it is read twice unnecessarily",
    "The variable names are obfuscated or randomly generated, which is unusual but not malicious",
    "No user input or untrusted data sources are used",
    "No code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration detected",
    "The code appears to be a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names"
  ],
  "analysis": "The script performs a typical package setup using setuptools, with reading 'README.md' for the long description. The variable names are intentionally obscure, but the code's logic is straightforward and typical for Python packaging. No suspicious network calls, data leaks, or malicious code are present. The only notable aspect is the obfuscated variable names, which do not indicate malicious intent but could hinder readability.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. The obfuscated variable names are unusual but not malicious. Overall, the code appears safe.",
