  "purpose": "Setup configuration for packaging the 'ecg_plot' Python library, including reading a README file for documentation.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file twice; assigning email to a variable; setting package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; no data leaks or external data effects observed.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md into variables, using static strings for package setup, no dynamic or external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "Repeated reading of README.md with inconsistent variable assignment; use of an undefined or malformed email field 'yTTMEQQChurGLnFWteUfwGOPNUsGmjKy=' which appears obfuscated or nonsensical; empty list assigned to 'kqkPXAcHtYjRwvVMDSCSoQmRkxuBBTJc=' which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard setup for a Python package using setuptools, reading the README file twice, and setting package metadata. The variable names are obfuscated and inconsistent, notably 'yTTMEQQChurGLnFWteUfwGOPNUsGmjKy=' used for the author email, which appears nonsensical. The empty list for 'kqkPXAcHtYjRwvVMDSCSoQmRkxuBBTJc' is unusual but not inherently malicious. No code injection, data leaks, or network activity is present. The obfuscation of variable names suggests possible concealment but does not indicate malicious intent in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with obfuscated variable names and inconsistent formatting. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The obfuscation may hinder readability but does not constitute malicious activity.",
