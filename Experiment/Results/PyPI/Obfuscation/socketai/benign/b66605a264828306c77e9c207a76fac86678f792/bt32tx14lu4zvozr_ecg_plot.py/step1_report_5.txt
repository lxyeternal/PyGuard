  "purpose": "The code generates and saves ECG plots as SVG, PNG, SVG, and JPG files, and includes functions for plotting ECG signals and saving figures in various formats.",
  "sources": "The code reads ECG data input passed to plotting functions and file path inputs for saving figures.",
  "sinks": "The code writes files to disk using plt.savefig() and opens SVG files via os.system('open ...').",
  "flows": "ECG data flows from function inputs into plotting routines; file paths are used in save commands; SVG files are opened with system commands.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function and variable names; use of os.system to open files without validation; minimal input validation or sanitization; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no evidence of data exfiltration, network communication, or reverse shells.",
  "analysis": "The script is primarily a plotting utility for ECG signals, using matplotlib to create detailed plots with grid and label customization. It includes functions to save figures in multiple formats and open SVG files. Variable and function names are intentionally obfuscated, but no malicious code such as network activity, data theft, or backdoors is present. The use of os.system('open ...') could potentially be exploited if file paths are manipulated maliciously, but in this context, it appears to serve for viewing generated files. There are no indications of malware or sabotage behavior, nor are there suspicious data flows or security risks beyond the minor system call usage. Overall, this appears to be a legitimate plotting utility with obfuscated naming but no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a plotting utility for ECG signals with obfuscated function names. It performs standard plotting and file saving operations without malicious behavior. No security risks or malware were detected; the only concern is the use of system commands without validation, which is unlikely to be malicious here.",
