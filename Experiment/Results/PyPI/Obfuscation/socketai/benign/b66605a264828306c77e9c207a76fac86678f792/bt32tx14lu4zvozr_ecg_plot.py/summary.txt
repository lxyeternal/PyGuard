  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate ECG plotting utility with obfuscated naming. There is no evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious sabotage. The main security concern is the use of system commands to open files, which could be exploited if filenames are externally manipulated. Overall, the supply chain security risk is low, but caution should be exercised regarding the obfuscation and system command usage."
