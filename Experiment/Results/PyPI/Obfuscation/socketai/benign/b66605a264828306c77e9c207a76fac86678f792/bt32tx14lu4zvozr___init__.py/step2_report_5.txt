  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the issues, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All snippets involve importing numerous functions or variables with obfuscated, nonsensical names from a local module 'ecg_plot', then calling a 'plot' function.\n- No data flows from untrusted sources, no network activity, or system modifications are evident.\n- The main concern is obfuscation, which could be benign or conceal malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n\n- **Issue presence:** The code matches the description—importing obfuscated identifiers, then calling 'plot'.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No logical errors; the reasoning correctly identifies obfuscation and lack of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware score 0.0 is appropriate; security risk 0.2 is reasonable given obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning is sound; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same pattern; import with obfuscated names, call to 'plot'.\n- **Errors/flaws:** Correctly notes no data flow from untrusted sources.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0.0 is appropriate; risk 0.2 is justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Sound reasoning; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same pattern, multiple obfuscated imports, call to 'plot'.\n- **Errors/flaws:** Accurate; no malicious activity evident.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0.1—appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same pattern; obfuscated imports, call to 'plot'.\n- **Errors/flaws:** The analysis correctly highlights suspicion due to obfuscation but finds no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0.2 might be slightly high, but given the suspicion, it's acceptable.\n- **Conclusion:** Reasonable; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same pattern; import with obfuscated names, call to 'plot'.\n- **Errors/flaws:** The analysis is appropriate; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0.2 is justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Sound reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- All reports correctly identify the obfuscation as suspicious but do not find evidence of malicious activity.\n- The malware scores are appropriately low or zero, considering the code's simplicity and lack of malicious behavior.\n- The obfuscation scores are high (~0.7), which is justified given the nonsensical identifiers.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 to 0.2 — The code is obfuscated but does not show malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.7 — Consistent with the reports.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — Slightly elevated due to obfuscation but no active threats.\n\n**Final conclusion:** The code appears to be benign but obfuscated, possibly to hide malicious intent. The current scores are appropriate, but vigilance is advised if more context or code is available.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent. No changes needed. The code is low risk, with obfuscation being the main concern.",
