  "purpose": "Import multiple functions/variables with obfuscated names from a local module 'ecg_plot' and invoke the 'plot' function.",
  "sources": "Import statements from './ecg_plot' module, reading obfuscated identifiers.",
  "sinks": "Call to 'plot' function; no data flow from untrusted sources evident.",
  "flows": "Imported obfuscated identifiers used in 'plot' invocation; no external data or network activity observed.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated, nonsensical identifiers suggesting possible concealment; minimal code structure.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several functions/variables with obfuscated names from a local module and calls 'plot'. No data flows from untrusted sources, no network activity, or malicious behavior are evident. The obfuscation raises suspicion but lacks concrete evidence of malicious intent. The scores assigned in reports (malware 0.0-0.2, obfuscated 0.7, risk 0.2) are consistent with the analysis. No signs of code injection, data exfiltration, or harmful behavior are present. The primary concern is obfuscation, which could be benign or conceal malicious code, but current evidence does not confirm malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign import and plotting routine with obfuscated identifiers. While obfuscation warrants caution, there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior. The scores should reflect a low malware risk, high obfuscation suspicion, and low overall security risk.",
