  "purpose": "Import specific functions and a plot object from a local module named 'ecg_plot'.",
  "sources": "The code imports functions and variables from a relative module './ecg_plot'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as untrusted data handling, network operations, or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only performs import and a function call.",
  "anomalies": "Imported identifiers are nonsensical and appear to be obfuscated or random, which could indicate obfuscation. The import statement itself is normal, but the naming is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several functions or variables with seemingly random, obfuscated names from a local module './ecg_plot'. The only other statement is a call to 'plot'. The identifiers do not correspond to descriptive or meaningful names, suggesting potential obfuscation. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network access, data exfiltration, or code injection. The use of random-looking names is suspicious but not conclusive malware. The code structure is simple and typical for plotting routines but with obfuscated identifiers.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward import and plot call with obfuscated identifiers. No malicious activity or suspicious behavior is evident from this snippet, but the obfuscated names could be an attempt to hide malicious intent. Overall, it is low risk but warrants caution due to obfuscation.",
