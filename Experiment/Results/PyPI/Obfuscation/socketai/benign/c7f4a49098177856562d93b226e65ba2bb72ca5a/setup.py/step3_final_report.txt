  "purpose": "Build configuration for a Python package with C++ extension, involving environment variables, compiler checks, and cleanup routines.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'TRAVIS_TAG', file reading ('README.md'), source files in 'src/', platform-specific compiler flags.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or network activity; only build-related file and environment interactions.",
  "flows": "Environment variable read -> version assignment; file read -> README content; source files compiled with flags; directory 'var' removed at end.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, deletion of 'var' directory without clear context, platform-specific compiler flags, cleanup routines.",
  "analysis": "The code is a complex build script with obfuscated variables and cleanup routines. No evidence of malicious activity such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The obfuscation and 'shutil.rmtree('var')' command are suspicious but could be benign cleanup. The environment variable usage and source file inclusion are standard. Overall, the script appears to be a legitimate build setup with some red flags due to obfuscation and directory removal.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated build configuration script that does not exhibit definitive malicious behavior. The suspicious patterns (obfuscation, directory cleanup) warrant caution but are not conclusive of malware. The overall security risk is low, with no evidence of malicious intent.",
