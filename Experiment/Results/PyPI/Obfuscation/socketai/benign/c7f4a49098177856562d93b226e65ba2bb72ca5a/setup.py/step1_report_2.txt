  "purpose": "Setup and build configuration for a Python package that interfaces with C++ code, possibly including native extensions.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (TRAVIS_TAG), file reading ('README.md'), and package setup arguments.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of environment variables, dynamic compilation with compiler checks, and file operations.",
  "flows": "Environment variable TRAVIS_TAG -> package version; 'README.md' content -> setup description; compiler capabilities -> conditional compilation flags.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names, dynamic compilation logic, and removal of 'var' directory at script end. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors detected. The obfuscation of variable names may be suspicious but can also be indicative of attempts to hide intent. No network communication or data exfiltration code observed.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily configures build settings for a Python package with C++ extensions, utilizing environment variables for versioning, and performing conditional compilation based on platform and compiler capabilities. It dynamically determines compiler support for C++ standards, adds specific compiler flags, and cleans up the 'var' directory after setup. The code appears to be standard for C++ extension building, with obfuscated variable names that could be suspicious but are not inherently malicious. No malicious behaviors such as network communication, data theft, or backdoors are evident. The use of dynamic checks and cleanup routines are typical for build scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate build script for a Python package with C++ extensions. Although it uses obfuscated variable names, which could be an attempt to hide complexity or intent, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The script performs standard setup tasks, environment-based configuration, and cleanup, with no suspicious network activity or data leakage observed.",
