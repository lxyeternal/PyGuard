{
  "purpose": "Import a module and define a function to iterate through OCR results at a specified page level.",
  "sources": "Import statement for _pysseract; function parameter 'self' and 'level'",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no untrusted data handling or output operations present",
  "flows": "Import flow from _pysseract to function; function does not process data beyond defining an iterator",
  "anomalies": "Unusual naming conventions for the function; no implementation code within the function; import from a potentially obscure module '_pysseract'",
  "analysis": "The code imports a possibly proprietary or less-known module '_pysseract' and defines a function with an obfuscated name that appears to relate to OCR processing. The function's docstring indicates it returns a generator for iterating OCR results at a certain page level. However, the function body is empty (only a docstring), with no implementation, data processing, or external interactions. The import from '_pysseract' might suggest a custom or internally developed package. No code performs data processing, network communication, or data leakage. The naming and structure are somewhat suspicious, but there is no active malicious behavior evident. The code is minimal and incomplete, which makes malicious intent unlikely based on available content.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a partial or stub implementation related to OCR processing. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or harmful actions. The only concern is the obscure import and unusual function naming, but no actual malicious activity is detectable.",
