{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a stub or partial implementation related to OCR processing, possibly auto-generated or obfuscated, intended to iterate OCR results at a specified page level.",
  "sources": "Import from '_pysseract' module, function parameter 'level' (PageIteratorLevel)",
  "sinks": "None present; no data processing, network activity, or data leaks observed",
  "flows": "No active code execution; function is a placeholder with no implementation",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function name 'HmotLoisLFfbQcOGMoOkPGTTesGFCHbe', import from a non-standard module '_pysseract', function body is empty",
  "analysis": "The code imports a potentially internal or proprietary module, defines an obfuscated function with a descriptive docstring but no implementation, and lacks any data handling or malicious activity. The obfuscation and incomplete nature suggest it may be auto-generated or intentionally concealed, but there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a non-functional stub with obfuscated naming and no active malicious or security issues. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware and risk scores remain low due to the absence of malicious actions or vulnerabilities.",

  "obfuscated": 0.6,
