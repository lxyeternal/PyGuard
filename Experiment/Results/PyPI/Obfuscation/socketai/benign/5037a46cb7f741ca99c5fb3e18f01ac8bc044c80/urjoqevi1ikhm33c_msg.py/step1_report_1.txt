{
  "purpose": "Definition of a tagged union class for handling various message types and states, likely in an asynchronous context.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries, expression module, and relative modules; class attributes initialized with types and default values.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; code primarily defines data structures without data output or external interactions.",
  "flows": "Data flows are limited to internal attribute assignments and type annotations; no untrusted data sources or external output paths are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code employs advanced typing, tagged unions, and custom types; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are visible. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a generic tagged union class with various labeled fields, each typed and annotated for specific states or data. No input/output functions, network calls, or external interactions are present. All imports are from standard or local modules, with no indication of malicious intent. The use of advanced typing and custom types appears to be legitimate for managing complex state in asynchronous workflows. No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate type definition for managing different message or state types within an asynchronous system. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
