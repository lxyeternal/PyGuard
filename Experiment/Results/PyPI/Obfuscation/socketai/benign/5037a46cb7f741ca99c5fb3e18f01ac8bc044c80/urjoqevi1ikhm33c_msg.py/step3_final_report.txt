{
  "purpose": "Type definition for a generic tagged union class representing various message or state types in an asynchronous context.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules and type annotations within the class; no external data input or runtime data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code does not process or output external data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; purely structural type definitions without data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual module names that appear obfuscated, but are imported modules, not malicious obfuscation. No runtime or dynamic code execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a generic tagged union class with multiple variants for message handling, using advanced typing and custom types. It contains no executable logic, network calls, or data leaks. The obfuscated-looking module names are likely naming conventions or auto-generated identifiers, not malicious. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0.2-0.3, risk=0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured data model for asynchronous message states, with no evidence of malware or security vulnerabilities. The slight obfuscation in identifiers does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code is benign and safe for use.",
