  "purpose": "Definition of a generic tagged union class for handling different message or state types related to observables or asynchronous operations.",
  "sources": "Imports from external modules ('typing', 'expression', and local modules), class attributes and their initializations.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data flows into sensitive operations or output. No functions or data transmissions present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code primarily defines data structures without execution or data processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "Use of complex type annotations and tagged unions appears standard. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscation detected. No malicious patterns or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party modules, defines type variables and new types, and creates a tagged union class with various states related to observables or asynchronous disposable objects. The structure appears to facilitate message handling in an asynchronous system. No dynamic code execution, network communication, or security-sensitive operations are present. The code is well-structured for data modeling without suspicious or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a data structure definition intended for message or state handling in an asynchronous or observable context. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. It appears to be legitimate and safe.",
