  "purpose": "Assignment of a version string to a variable",
  "sources": "No input sources; static string assignment",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data leakage or untrusted data usage",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "Variable name appears as a random string, which may indicate obfuscation or lack of clarity, but no malicious behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static string '0.20.0' to a variable with a seemingly random name 'OmCHdwhMNgqrVryXPnjAkYdvcZagdcWN'. There are no input sources, no data flows, no function calls, and no suspicious behaviors such as network activity, code execution, or credential handling. The variable name does not follow typical naming conventions, which could be a sign of obfuscation, but it alone is not malicious. Overall, the code appears to be a benign assignment statement with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple variable assignment with a nonsensical variable name. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident.",
