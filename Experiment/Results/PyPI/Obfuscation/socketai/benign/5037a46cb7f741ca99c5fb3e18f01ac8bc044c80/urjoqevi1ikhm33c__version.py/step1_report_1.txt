  "purpose": "Assigns a version string '0.20.0' to a variable with a seemingly random name.",
  "sources": "Assignment to variable 'OmCHdwhMNgqrVryXPnjAkYdvcZagdcWN'",
  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "None",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable name that appears obfuscated or auto-generated; no additional code or context provided.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static string '0.20.0' to a variable with a complex, nonsensical name. There are no inputs, no data flows, no network operations, and no other code present. The variable name may suggest obfuscation or auto-generation but does not itself indicate malicious intent. Lack of additional code prevents any further source-to-sink flow analysis or malicious activity detection.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment appears benign, simply setting a version string to a variable with a non-descriptive name. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues in this isolated line.",
