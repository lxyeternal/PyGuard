{
  "purpose": "Defines an abstract reactive notification interface with concrete implementations for onNext, onError, and onCompleted signals, facilitating asynchronous callback invocation.",
  "sources": "Callback functions passed into the notification classes, invoked with data or exceptions.",
  "sinks": "External callback functions that may process untrusted data or exceptions, potentially leading to misuse if untrusted.",
  "flows": "External callback functions are called with internal data or exceptions, e.g., in onNext, onError, and onCompleted methods.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation of class and variable names; invocation of external callbacks with data/exceptions which could be untrusted; no hardcoded secrets or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a reactive notification pattern with abstract and concrete classes, invoking provided callbacks asynchronously. Obfuscation is consistent but not inherently malicious. The main concern is that callback functions are invoked with data or exceptions, which could be exploited if those functions are malicious or untrusted. No malicious payloads, network calls, or data exfiltration are present. The obfuscation level is high, warranting caution but not conclusively indicating malicious intent. The pattern is standard for reactive programming but requires context review for trustworthiness of callbacks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, obfuscated reactive notification framework with no explicit malicious payloads. The primary security concern is the invocation of external callback functions with potentially untrusted data, which could be exploited if those functions are malicious. Overall, the code poses low malware risk but moderate security risk due to its pattern and obfuscation.",
