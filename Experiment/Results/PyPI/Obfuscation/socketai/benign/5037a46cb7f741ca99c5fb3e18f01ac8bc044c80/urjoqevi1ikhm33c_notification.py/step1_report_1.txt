{
  "purpose": "This code defines an abstract reactive interface and several concrete implementations representing different reactive notification types (onNext, onError, onCompleted) with asynchronous methods.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters, class attributes, and imported modules (such as .types).",
  "sinks": "The code invokes passed-in callback functions asynchronously, which could be untrusted input if improperly used elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (e.g., callbacks and exceptions) through async method calls to the callback functions. No external network or file system access is directly evident within this code.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses obfuscated class names and variable names, which can obscure intent. However, there are no hardcoded secrets, malicious backdoors, or suspicious code constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes an abstract class for reactive pattern notifications, with concrete classes for onNext, onError, and onCompleted signals. The classes invoke callback functions asynchronously, passing relevant data. The use of dynamic class names and variable names appears intentionally obfuscated but does not directly suggest malicious behavior. There are no evident network calls, file operations, or data exfiltration points. The structure appears consistent with reactive programming patterns. No malicious activity or sabotage mechanisms are detected. The obfuscation may be suspicious but is not conclusive of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of reactive notification handlers with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The design is consistent with asynchronous event handling, and no malicious actions are observed within this fragment.",
