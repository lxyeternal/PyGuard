  "purpose": "Documentation and interface definitions for loading and parsing MIDI files into a Multitrack object.",
  "sources": "File path parameters and PrettyMIDI object inputs within function parameters.",
  "sinks": "No external data transfer or network activity; internal parsing only.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (file path, PrettyMIDI object) to internal parsing functions, with no external data sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Repeated presence of the string 'lmLRibKuBZSyQlNVNSTrMpQopPxgjGai' embedded in comments and documentation, likely a placeholder or artifact.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of documentation and function signatures without executable logic. The recurring strange string appears in comments, not in code execution paths, indicating it is a placeholder or typo rather than malicious code. No network activity, secrets, or obfuscation of logic are present. The anomalies do not impact functionality but suggest documentation artifacts. The scores assigned in the reports reflect the benign nature, with minor risk due to placeholder artifacts. No evidence of malicious behavior or malicious intent is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe and benign, primarily consisting of documentation with no malicious or obfuscated logic. The repeated strange string is likely a placeholder or documentation artifact, not malicious code. The overall security risk is negligible, and malware likelihood is zero.",
