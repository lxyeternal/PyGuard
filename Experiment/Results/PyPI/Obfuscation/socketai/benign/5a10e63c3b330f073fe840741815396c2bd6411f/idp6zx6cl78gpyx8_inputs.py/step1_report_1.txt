  "purpose": "Documentation for input interfaces of a music processing library, including functions to load, read, and convert MIDI files to internal data structures.",
  "sources": "Path parameters for load, from_pretty_midi, and read functions; PrettyMIDI objects; user-provided file paths.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted MIDI files or data streams read from disk, but no data is sent externally or written to network.",
  "flows": "Input files or objects (source) are read, parsed into internal data structures (Multitrack), with no data leaving the system externally.",
  "anomalies": "No code snippets or logic are included; only documentation. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be documentation describing functions for loading and converting MIDI files within a music processing library. There are no executable code snippets, no input/output operations beyond file reading, and no embedded logic that could be malicious. The parameters and descriptions are standard for file input functions, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. The documentation references functions for saving and reading files, but provides no indication of harmful code. Overall, the code is benign and solely informational.",
  "conclusion": "This is purely documentation for a music processing library with no executable or malicious code. There are no suspicious behaviors, no signs of malware, and no security risks identified. The code is safe.",
