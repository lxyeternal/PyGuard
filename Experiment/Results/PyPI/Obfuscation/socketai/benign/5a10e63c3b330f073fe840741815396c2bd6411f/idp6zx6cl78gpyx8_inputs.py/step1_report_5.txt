{
  "purpose": "Provides functions for loading and reading MIDI files and converting them into internal Multitrack objects for further processing.",
  "sources": "Reading MIDI files from a given file path; parsing PrettyMIDI objects",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or potential data leaks observed",
  "flows": "Data flows from file input or PrettyMIDI objects into Multitrack objects without evident manipulation or transmission",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a nonsensical string 'lmLRibKuBZSyQlNVNSTrMpQopPxgjGai' embedded multiple times, which appears out of context and is likely obfuscated or corrupted; no other suspicious behavior is evident",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a straightforward interface for loading and parsing MIDI files, with detailed parameter descriptions and references to related functions. The repeated nonsensical string suggests potential obfuscation or corruption, but no malicious logic such as network transmission, file damage, or backdoors is present. The functions do not perform any insecure operations, nor do they contain hardcoded secrets or suspicious code paths.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a standard MIDI data loader with no evidence of malicious intent. The presence of an anomalous string suggests possible obfuscation or corruption but does not indicate malicious behavior. Overall security risk is low.",
