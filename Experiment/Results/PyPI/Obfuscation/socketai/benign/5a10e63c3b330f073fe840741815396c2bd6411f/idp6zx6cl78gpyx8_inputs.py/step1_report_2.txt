{
  "purpose": "Provides functions for loading and reading MIDI files into a Multitrack object, supporting different algorithms and modes.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'path' for file reading, 'midi' as a PrettyMIDI object, and keyword arguments.",
  "sinks": "None identified that directly send data to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used within functions to parse and convert MIDI data into internal data structures.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of seemingly random strings like 'lmLRibKuBZSyQlNVNSTrMpQopPxgjGai' embedded within comments; no other suspicious code or hardcoded secrets observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of documentation and function signatures for loading and converting MIDI files. The random strings appear in comments as part of the documentation, likely placeholders or artifacts. No active code execution, network operations, or data manipulation that could be malicious was found. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code are present. The functions appear to perform legitimate MIDI file parsing tasks, with options for different algorithms and modes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard documentation and function signatures for MIDI data handling, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The unusual strings are benign and likely placeholders or artifacts, not malicious code.",
