{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for plotting piano rolls, tracks, and multitrack MIDI data visualization using matplotlib.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters such as 'pianoroll', 'track', and 'multitrack'; accesses properties of these objects; user-defined kwargs for plotting.",
  "sinks": "Potential for plotting untrusted data, but no direct data leaks or dangerous data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> Processing and plotting functions -> Visualization output (matplotlib axes). No external data transmission or system modification observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors. Documentation mentions specific plot themes and color maps, but nothing suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The functions are designed solely for visualization, accepting data structures and parameters for plotting. No external network calls, file manipulations, or code execution methods are present. Usage of standard matplotlib functions and user-supplied data poses no inherent security risk. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are detected. The code is well-structured for its purpose, with clear parameter definitions and defaults.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of visualization functions for musical data with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It purely handles plotting, and all data flows are within expected boundaries for such a purpose.",
