  "purpose": "Functions for plotting musical data such as piano rolls and tracks, primarily for visualization purposes.",
  "sources": "Input parameters including data arrays, track objects, and configuration options for plotting.",
  "sinks": "Matplotlib plotting functions; no network, file, or system modification operations detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into plotting routines; no external data leaks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of placeholder-like strings (e.g., 'zWhJYqFbIGuCkYFrVLChOFKGmBxyYFNO', 'lmLRibKuBZSyQlNVNSTrMpQopPxgjGai') suggest possible obfuscation or copy-paste artifacts; no malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard visualization functions for musical data, with well-documented parameters and no signs of malicious behavior. The strange strings are suspicious but appear to be artifacts rather than malicious payloads. No network activity, file operations, or code injections are present. The overall structure is straightforward, and the functions serve purely aesthetic purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended solely for visualization of musical data, with no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The anomalies are likely placeholder or formatting artifacts rather than obfuscation or malicious code.",
