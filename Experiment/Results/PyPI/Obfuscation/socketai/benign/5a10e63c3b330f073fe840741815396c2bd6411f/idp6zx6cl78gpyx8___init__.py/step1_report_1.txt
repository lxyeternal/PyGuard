  "purpose": "Description of the Pypianoroll library and its features for handling and visualizing piano rolls, parsing MIDI files, and saving data.",
  "sources": "No code provided; only a descriptive text about the library's features.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points identified; no code execution or data transmission observed.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no executable code or data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code snippets means no unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The provided text is purely a descriptive summary of the library's capabilities. There are no code statements, no functions, no data processing, and no input/output operations to analyze for security risks or malicious activity. Without actual code, it is impossible to identify sources, sinks, flows, or anomalies. The description aligns with a typical open-source library purpose and features, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on the descriptive text, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The library appears to be a standard, open-source audio processing tool with no suspicious elements. No further analysis is possible without actual code.",
