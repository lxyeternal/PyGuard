  "purpose": "High-level overview and description of the Pypianoroll library's features and capabilities.",
  "sources": "No code snippets or data input points; only descriptive text about library features.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling; purely descriptive.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths; only feature descriptions.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code, suspicious patterns, or unusual behaviors; no anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The reports are based solely on descriptive summaries without actual source code. They correctly identify the lack of suspicious or malicious code, assigning malware scores of 0 and obfuscation scores of 0. Risk scores are low (0 or 0.2), reflecting the absence of concrete vulnerabilities or malicious activity. Confidence levels are high due to the detailed reasoning and lack of code evidence. Given the limitations, the assessments are conservative and appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "All reports accurately reflect the benign and standard nature of the library based on the provided descriptions. No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks is present. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and no modifications are necessary.",
