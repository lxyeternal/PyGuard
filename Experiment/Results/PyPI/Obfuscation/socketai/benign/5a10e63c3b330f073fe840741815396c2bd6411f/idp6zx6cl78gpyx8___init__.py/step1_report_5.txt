  "purpose": "Describe and provide tools for handling, manipulating, visualizing, and parsing multitrack piano rolls, including MIDI I/O.",
  "sources": "Potentially input files (e.g., MIDI files) loaded for parsing or saving; user-provided data for visualization or manipulation.",
  "sinks": "Saving MIDI files, visualization outputs, or any data export functions; potential network transmission if implemented internally, but not specified here.",
  "flows": "Input MIDI files or user data → processing/manipulation → output MIDI files or visualizations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors observed; no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no malicious logic evident.",
  "analysis": "The provided description outlines features for MIDI and piano roll handling, which are typical for a music processing library. There is no evidence of code that reads or writes untrusted data in an insecure manner, nor any indicators of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration or backdoors. Since only descriptive text is provided, no actual code snippets reveal potential malicious actions. The module appears focused on music data processing, with no signs of suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided description, Pypianoroll appears to be a legitimate open-source music processing library with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The scope and features are typical for such a tool, and no anomalies are detected.",
