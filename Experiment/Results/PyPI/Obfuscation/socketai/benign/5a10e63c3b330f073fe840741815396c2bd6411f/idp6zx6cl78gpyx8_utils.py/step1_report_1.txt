{
  "purpose": "Provide functions for sparse matrix decomposition, reconstruction, and harmonic mean calculation.",
  "sources": "No explicit input sources; functions operate on provided parameters or data structures.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output that could leak data or cause security issues.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through processing functions to return values; no untrusted data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or obfuscated code detected. The description suggests standard mathematical operations.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to define three mathematical functions: decompose_sparse, reconstruct_sparse, and hmean. The hmean function mentions converting a matrix to a scipy.sparse.csc_matrix and returning component arrays, indicating use of the SciPy library. No evidence of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors, is present. No signs of code injection or unsafe operations are observed. The functions seem straightforward and related to matrix operations and statistical calculations. There are no suspicious behaviors or anomalies in the provided description.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of matrix decomposition, reconstruction, and harmonic mean calculation, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
