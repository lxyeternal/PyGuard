{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package, reading README.md for long description and version.py for version info, then configuring package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md and version.py files; no external or untrusted input sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external communications; no untrusted data processing beyond file reading.",
  "flows": "Reads files to obtain description and version; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Contains obfuscated function names; uses undefined variables 'line' and 'delimeter' in version parsing; mismatched function calls (e.g., '_get_version()' vs. actual function name). These indicate code bugs and obfuscation but no malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks with obfuscated naming and some coding errors. The bugs are likely due to incomplete or obfuscated code, not malicious behavior. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. The obfuscation and bugs reduce code clarity but do not suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated setup script with coding errors and no evidence of malicious activity. The obfuscation appears intentional but does not indicate security threats. The overall security risk is low, and malware likelihood is negligible.",
