{
  "purpose": "Class 'Multitrack' manages MIDI piano roll data, including attributes like resolution, tempo, downbeat, and tracks, for music processing and analysis.",
  "sources": "Class attributes and method parameters, including data inputs for resolution, tempo, downbeat, and tracks.",
  "sinks": "Internal data structures; no external data flow or network activity detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from class attributes and method parameters into processing functions within the class.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated variable names (e.g., 'lmLRibKuBZSyQlNVNSTrMpQopPxgjGai') and placeholder-like docstrings; no malicious code or secrets evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard data container for MIDI or piano roll data, with methods for validation, blending, padding, transposing, and exporting. Obfuscation is extensive but superficial, likely for code concealment or placeholder purposes. No network calls, file I/O, or malicious payloads are visible. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not demonstrate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical, heavily obfuscated implementation of a MIDI processing class with no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain compromise. The high obfuscation is a concern for maintainability but not indicative of malicious activity.",
