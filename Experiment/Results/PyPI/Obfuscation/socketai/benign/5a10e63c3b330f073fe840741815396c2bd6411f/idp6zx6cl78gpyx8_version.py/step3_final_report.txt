  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code input, environment variables, user input, dynamic execution points (eval/exec).",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network communication, file operations, dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Input sources to sinks via data processing, environment variables, or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated code, use of eval/exec, high obfuscation scores, dynamic code execution, unusual variable naming.",
  "analysis": "The code shows minimal or benign patterns in most reports, with no suspicious activity or obfuscation, justified by low malware and obfuscation scores. Report 3 exhibits obfuscation and dynamic execution, raising suspicion, justified by higher malware (0.65), obfuscation (0.8), and security risk (0.75) scores. The other reports' scores are consistent with their benign descriptions. Slight adjustments could be made to risk scores for the clearly benign reports (1, 2, 4, 5) to reflect their low threat more accurately, reducing from 0.2 to 0.1 where appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "Most code snippets are benign with low security risk; Report 3's obfuscation and dynamic execution justify higher suspicion and scores. Overall, the scores are consistent with the analyses, with minor potential for refinement in risk scoring for benign reports.",
