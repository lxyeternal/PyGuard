  "purpose": "This code appears to be a standard utility script, potentially for data processing or system management, with no immediately obvious malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input data could come from user input, environment variables, or external modules. No explicit input functions are present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file operations, or subprocess calls, but none are explicitly used here.",
  "flows": "No clear source-to-sink data flow identified; code mostly consists of function definitions and variable assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic detected. No unusual imports or behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises standard Python constructs, with no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The absence of external network calls or insecure operations reduces suspicion. The code appears to be benign and typical for legitimate use cases.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a normal utility script with no suspicious elements.",
