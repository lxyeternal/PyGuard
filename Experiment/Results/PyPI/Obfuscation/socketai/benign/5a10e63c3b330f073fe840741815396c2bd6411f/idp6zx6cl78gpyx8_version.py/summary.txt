  "security_risk": 0.75,
  "obfuscated": 0.8,

  "conclusion": "Most code snippets are benign with low security risk; Report 3's obfuscation and dynamic execution justify higher suspicion and scores. Overall, the scores are consistent with the analyses, with minor potential for refinement in risk scoring for benign reports."
