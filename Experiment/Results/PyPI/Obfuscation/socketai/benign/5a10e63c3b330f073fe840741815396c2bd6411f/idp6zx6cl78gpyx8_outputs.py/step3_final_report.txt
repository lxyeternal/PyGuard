  "analysis": "The provided content consists solely of documentation snippets with no actual code execution, network activity, or data processing. The strange strings appear to be placeholder or obfuscation artifacts, not malicious code. No suspicious logic, network connections, or data leaks are evident. The anomalies are confined to comments and docstrings, indicating documentation corruption or placeholder text rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe and contains no malware. The anomalies are artifacts of placeholder or obfuscation artifacts in documentation, not active threats or malicious behavior. The overall security risk is minimal.",
