      "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated variable names and hardcoded secrets, raising security concerns. However, there is no direct evidence of malicious activity such as network communication or system compromise. The suspicion is primarily due to obfuscation and embedded secrets, which could be exploited if extracted. The overall malware likelihood is low, but the obfuscation and secrets justify a moderate security alert. Further analysis, such as deobfuscation or dynamic testing, is recommended before deployment."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard package management script with obfuscated variable names and subprocess calls. No evidence of malware or malicious intent is found. The main risk involves potential exploitation if input files are malicious, but this is a common concern with such scripts. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is moderate (~0.3), and security risk is moderate (~0.3). It should be used cautiously with untrusted inputs but is not inherently malicious."
