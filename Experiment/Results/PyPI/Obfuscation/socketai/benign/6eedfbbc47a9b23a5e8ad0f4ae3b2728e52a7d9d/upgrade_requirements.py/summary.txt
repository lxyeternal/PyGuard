  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package management script with obfuscated variable names and subprocess calls. No evidence of malware or malicious intent is found. The main risk involves potential exploitation if input files are malicious, but this is a common concern with such scripts. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is moderate (~0.3), and security risk is moderate (~0.3). It should be used cautiously with untrusted inputs but is not inherently malicious."
