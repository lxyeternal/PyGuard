      "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious activity. The primary concern is the use of wildcard imports and obfuscated variable names, which could conceal malicious code in larger contexts. The overall malware score is 0, obfuscation score around 0.6, and security risk score approximately 0.2, reflecting minimal risk but some caution due to import practices."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate secrets management utility with obfuscation that raises red flags but does not demonstrate malicious behavior. No malware or malicious activity is detected. The overall security risk is low, but the obfuscation warrants cautious review in supply chain contexts."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated data container class that manages server info and secrets. While obfuscation and secret exposure warrant caution, there is no evidence of malicious activity or behavior. The current scores are appropriate; malware score should remain at 0, obfuscation high (~0.75), and moderate risk (~0.3) due to secret handling. Vigilance is advised if secrets are sensitive or if integrated into larger systems, but based solely on this snippet, it is not malicious."

      "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign, representing a simple version assignment with obfuscated variable naming. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation alone does not imply malicious intent in this context. Overall, the security risk is very low, and the code can be considered safe."
