{
  "purpose": "The code appears to handle loading, validating, and processing server configuration files in YAML format, including schema validation and referencing server and server group data.",
  "sources": "Reads YAML server configuration files from disk, and reads environment variables or external schemas during validation.",
  "sinks": "Uses external schemas for validation; constructs file paths; potentially accesses or validates user-defined data schemas.",
  "flows": "Loads configuration data from disk -> validates with schemas -> processes server and group references -> returns processed configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Use of dynamic path resolution based on file location is typical. No network activity or system modification observed.",
  "analysis": "The code securely loads and validates YAML configuration files with JSON schemas, including error handling for file access, syntax errors, and validation failures. The schemas and data are processed locally with no external network communication. No evidence of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The structure is typical for configuration management, with thorough validation and error handling. The use of external schemas and validation logic appears legitimate and standard. No signs of supply chain sabotage or malicious code, and the code focuses solely on data validation and access within a local environment.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a standard configuration loader and validator, with no malicious behavior detected. It does not perform any network activity, system modification, or data exfiltration. The logic is consistent with safe configuration handling, with comprehensive validation and error management.",
