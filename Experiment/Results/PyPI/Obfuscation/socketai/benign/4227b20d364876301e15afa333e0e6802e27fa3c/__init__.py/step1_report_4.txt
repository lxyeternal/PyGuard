  "purpose": "This code appears to initialize a package by importing specific modules and exposing version information.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (_vault_file, _server, _server_file, _version)",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no data processing or output functions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; mostly module imports and version assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple wildcard imports (*) can obscure actual imported content, potentially hiding malicious code or unintended functions. Variable name 'zngYvrAmXBxyYQgvxLBgIQgjIGEkiQyo' is nonsensical, suggesting obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several internal modules using wildcard imports, which can obscure what is imported and may hide malicious functions. The assignment of an imported version to a similarly obfuscated variable indicates possible obfuscation. No direct malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code execution, is evident from these lines. However, the use of obscure variable names and wildcard imports raises suspicion about potential hidden malicious code elsewhere.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily structural, intended to expose module components and version info. The use of wildcard imports and nonsensical variable names suggest possible obfuscation or malicious intent, but no explicit malicious actions are observable within this snippet. Caution should be exercised if reviewing the entire package.",
