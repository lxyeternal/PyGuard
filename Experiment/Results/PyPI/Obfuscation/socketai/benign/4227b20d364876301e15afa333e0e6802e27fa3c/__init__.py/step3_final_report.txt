{
  "purpose": "The code imports internal modules and assigns a version attribute to an obfuscated variable, with no apparent malicious activity.",
  "sources": "Imports from ._vault_file, ._server, ._server_file, and ._version modules; access to _version.zngYvrAmXBxyYQgvxLBgIQgjIGEkiQyo.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows indicating untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "The version attribute from _version flows into the obfuscated variable, with no external data or network interactions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports (*), and a highly obfuscated variable name 'zngYvrAmXBxyYQgvxLBgIQgjIGEkiQyo'.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward internal module imports and assigns a version attribute to an obfuscated variable. No data flows, external communication, or malicious behavior are evident. The obfuscated variable name and wildcard imports are potential indicators of obfuscation or concealment but do not directly imply malicious intent in this context. The wildcard imports could hide malicious code elsewhere, but within this snippet, no such activity is present. The obfuscation appears to be solely in variable naming, not in code execution or data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious activity. The primary concern is the use of wildcard imports and obfuscated variable names, which could conceal malicious code in larger contexts. The overall malware score is 0, obfuscation score around 0.6, and security risk score approximately 0.2, reflecting minimal risk but some caution due to import practices.",
