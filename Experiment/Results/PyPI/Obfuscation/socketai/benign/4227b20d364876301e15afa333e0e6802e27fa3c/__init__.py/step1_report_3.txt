{
  "purpose": "Import modules and version information, likely for a larger package or library.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, local modules (_vault_file, _server, _server_file), and version info from _version.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data or external effects; no data leaks or malicious actions apparent.",
  "flows": "No clear data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; imports are static.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obscure variable name 'zngYvrAmXBxyYQgvxLBgIQgjIGEkiQyo' which appears as a random string, possibly obfuscated or auto-generated. No other suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, including future features, local modules, and version info. The variable with a nonsensical name assigned from the _version module may be an obfuscated or auto-generated artifact, but it does not inherently indicate malicious behavior. No code execution, data handling, or network operations are present. The pattern suggests standard import structure with an unusual variable name but no malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward module import snippet with an anomalous variable name. No evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The unusual variable name might be obfuscation or an auto-generated identifier, but it does not pose security concerns.",
