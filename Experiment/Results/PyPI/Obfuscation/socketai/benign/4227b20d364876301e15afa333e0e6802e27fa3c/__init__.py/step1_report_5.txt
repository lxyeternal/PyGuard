{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module importing specific components and version information, likely for use in a larger application.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: ._vault_file, ._server, ._server_file, and ._version",
  "sinks": "Assignment of version attribute from _version module to a variable",
  "flows": "Imported modules provide functionality; version info is assigned to a variable but not used further in this fragment",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code behavior; no dynamic code execution or obfuscation observed",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports modules and assigns a version attribute to a variable. All imported modules seem to be internal (denoted by dot notation), and no suspicious operations, network activity, or malicious logic are present. The code is minimal, structured, and lacks any unusual constructs. It appears to serve as a part of a package's __init__.py or similar setup file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and appears to be standard import statements for a Python package. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within this fragment.",
