  "purpose": "Define a Server class encapsulating server metadata and secrets.",
  "sources": "Data sources include function parameters, class attributes, and dictionary keys (e.g., 'description', 'contact_name', 'access_via', 'user_defined', '_secrets').",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are class attributes and properties where sensitive data (secrets) are stored or accessed, such as '_secrets' and 'IoEFxetAnsPqdOvWcxPurXbGxyTompSc'.",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor parameters and dictionary keys into class attributes; secrets can be accessed via the 'secrets' property, potentially exposing sensitive info if accessed improperly.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses obfuscated property and variable names, especially with the 'IoEFxetAnsPqdOvWcxPurXbGxyTompSc' variable and class name, which could suggest an attempt to conceal intent. The presence of a '_secrets' attribute and its exposure via a property may be suspicious, especially if secrets contain sensitive data.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with a complex naming scheme and multiple obfuscated identifiers, which can be a red flag. It stores various metadata fields and a '_secrets' attribute, which can hold sensitive information. The '__repr__' method conditionally displays either all info or 'None' for secrets, indicating some awareness of secret data handling. No explicit malicious behavior (such as network activity, system modification, or code execution) is present. The obfuscation and handling of secrets could be used to conceal malicious data or backdoors, but there is no concrete evidence of malicious intent in this isolated snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to define a data container class with obfuscated names and secret management. There are no direct signs of malicious actions such as network communication, file manipulation, or backdoor behavior. However, the obfuscation and handling of secrets should be reviewed in context with other components to rule out malicious intent.",
