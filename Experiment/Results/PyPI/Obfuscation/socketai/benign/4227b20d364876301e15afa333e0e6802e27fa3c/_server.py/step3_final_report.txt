  "purpose": "A data container class for server information, including secrets, with obfuscated variable names.",
  "sources": "Constructor parameters, class attributes, __repr__ method, property getters",
  "sinks": "Exposing secrets in __repr__, property accessors",
  "flows": "Initialization from constructor to attributes, secrets accessed via property, secrets displayed in __repr__",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and class names, secrets stored and exposed via __repr__",
  "analysis": "The code defines an obfuscated class acting as a data container for server info, including secrets. It initializes attributes from input parameters, exposes secrets via properties, and conditionally masks secrets in __repr__. No network, file, or malicious code is present. Obfuscation and secret exposure are notable but not inherently malicious. The code's behavior is benign, with no evidence of malicious intent or activity. The obfuscation raises suspicion but could be for concealment or obfuscation purposes. The exposure of secrets in __repr__ could be risky if secrets are sensitive, but no malicious activity is evident. The scores assigned in reports (malware near 0, obfuscation high, moderate risk) are consistent with the code's characteristics.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated data container class that manages server info and secrets. While obfuscation and secret exposure warrant caution, there is no evidence of malicious activity or behavior. The current scores are appropriate; malware score should remain at 0, obfuscation high (~0.75), and moderate risk (~0.3) due to secret handling. Vigilance is advised if secrets are sensitive or if integrated into larger systems, but based solely on this snippet, it is not malicious.",
