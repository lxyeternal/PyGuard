{
  "purpose": "Defines a Server class that encapsulates server-related information such as nickname, description, contact name, access method, user-defined info, and secrets.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from constructor parameters: 'osVSClwJGWwLcksfVGanIKnqNlJmeDQE' and 'sYduGkkUWSvFBcTSLcyPMFAvzTHCcvHE', as well as optional 'lqKEACPiTgDRebKRwYpQReBwgQqDiBLG'.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data; no output functions, network connections, or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor parameters into object attributes; no data flows into or out of external systems within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Use of seemingly obfuscated variable names; no obvious malicious behavior, but the naming suggests deliberate obfuscation. The class stores secrets but does not show how they are used or transmitted.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with a constructor that initializes various attributes, some from input data. It employs property decorators to access private attributes. No network activity, data leakage, or malicious code is present. The obfuscated variable names could be a sign of hiding intent, but there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior in this snippet. The class appears to be a data container for server info, with no evident harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward data container class with obfuscated variable names. There is no clear malicious intent or suspicious behavior in this snippet. The use of obfuscated variable names warrants caution, but based on this code alone, it seems benign.",
