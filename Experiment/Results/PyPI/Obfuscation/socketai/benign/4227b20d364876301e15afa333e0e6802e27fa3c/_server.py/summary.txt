  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated data container class that manages server info and secrets. While obfuscation and secret exposure warrant caution, there is no evidence of malicious activity or behavior. The current scores are appropriate; malware score should remain at 0, obfuscation high (~0.75), and moderate risk (~0.3) due to secret handling. Vigilance is advised if secrets are sensitive or if integrated into larger systems, but based solely on this snippet, it is not malicious."
