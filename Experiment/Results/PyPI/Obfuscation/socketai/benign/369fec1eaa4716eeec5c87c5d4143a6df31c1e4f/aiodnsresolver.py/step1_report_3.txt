There are also complex nested functions with network operations, data parsing, and error handling that seem overly intricate for typical DNS resolution tasks. Also, the code dynamically handles socket data and includes exception handling that can mask errors or malicious activity. Use of 'secrets.choice' and random number generation is also noted, but not inherently suspicious. Hardcoded paths like '/etc/resolv.conf' and '/etc/hosts' are typical for DNS resolver tools but could be exploited if combined with malicious data.',\n  \"analysis\": \"The code is highly complex with obfuscated variable names, which makes it difficult to interpret fully. It performs network socket operations, DNS parsing, and configuration file reading, which are common in DNS resolvers or network tools. The presence of functions that handle socket creation, data transmission, and response parsing suggests it could be part of a DNS client or resolver. The code includes fallback import mechanisms, dynamic socket management, asynchronous operations, and error handling, which are typical for network programming but could also be used to mask malicious intent. There are no explicit payloads, data exfiltration, or command execution indicators. The code's complexity and obfuscation increase suspicion but are not definitive proof of malicious behavior. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate, though complex, network utility with some obfuscated parts that could hide malicious activity.\",\n  \"conclusion\": \"The analyzed code appears to implement a sophisticated asynchronous DNS resolution and socket communication framework. Its obfuscation and complex structure raise suspicion, but no clear malicious actions, such as data exfiltration, command execution, or system sabotage, are evident. It resembles a legitimate network resolver or diagnostic tool, but its obfuscated nature warrants caution. There is a low to moderate possibility that parts of this code could be used maliciously if combined with malicious data or intended for covert operations, but based solely on this snippet, it does not exhibit explicit malicious intent.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.6,\n  \"obfuscated\": 0.8,\n  \"malware\": 0.2,\n  \"securityRisk\": 0.3\n}",
