  "purpose": "This code contains only metadata comments (encoding declaration, creation date, author) with no executable logic, data sources, sinks, or flows.",
  "sources": "No data sources; only comments and metadata present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; no source-to-sink paths exist.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; only comments and metadata, no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely metadata comments with no executable statements, functions, variables, or data processing. All reviews confirm the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The code does not perform any operations, read inputs, or interact with external systems. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, containing only header comments with no operational or malicious content. It poses no security risk or malware threat, and the scores reflect this accurately.",
