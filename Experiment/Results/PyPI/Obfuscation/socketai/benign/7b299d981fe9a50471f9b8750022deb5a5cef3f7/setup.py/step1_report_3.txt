  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing a Python project named 'uha9tcgn4zrpouef'.",
  "sources": "No input sources; static code defining package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static configuration code.",
  "anomalies": "The package name 'uha9tcgn4zrpouef' appears random and obfuscated; minimal metadata provided.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, with fallback import handling for setuptools. The package name appears intentionally obfuscated, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No input reading, no data leakage, and no execution of untrusted code or network activity. The code does not contain any suspicious logic or malicious indicators. The obfuscated package name could be for privacy or to evade detection, but this alone does not confirm malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration with an obfuscated package name. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this script.",
