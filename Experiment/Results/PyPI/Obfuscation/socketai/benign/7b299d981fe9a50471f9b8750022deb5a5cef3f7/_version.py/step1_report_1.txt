  "purpose": "Define version information for the package, including version tuple and string representation.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded version tuple (__version_info__).",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "Assignment of __version__ string from __version_info__, which is a hardcoded tuple.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is straightforward and conventional.",
  "analysis": "The code imports no external data, performs simple tuple-to-string conversion, and conditionally appends the last tuple element if its length is 4. There are no suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious logic. The code appears to serve a versioning purpose with no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only to define version information without any malicious intent or security issues.",
