  "purpose": "The code appears to define version information for a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "Reads data from a tuple (__version_info__) for versioning information.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to external systems or untrusted data areas are present.",
  "flows": "Version tuple data is transformed into a string, but no data flows to untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward; no suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated elements are present. The conditional appending of the last element if tuple length is 4 is normal behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports no modules, defines a version tuple, converts it to a string, and conditionally appends an element if the tuple length is 4. All operations are simple and serve version string formation. No input/output or external data handling occurs. The code is clean and typical for version management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended solely for version information management. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
