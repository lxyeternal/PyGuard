{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define version information for a Python module or package.",
  "sources": "The version info tuple (__version_info__) used to generate the __version__ string.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present in this code.",
  "flows": "The code transforms __version_info__ into a version string stored in __version__, but no external data flows are involved.",
  "anomalies": "The code constructs a version string with conditional appending of an additional version component; no anomalies, hidden behavior, or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version info tuple, then creates a string representation of it by joining the first three elements. If a fourth element exists, it appends it directly to the version string. The code is straightforward, with no external inputs, no suspicious operations, and no malicious constructs. It only manages version information.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version string generator for a package, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs basic version formatting and has no malicious intent.",
