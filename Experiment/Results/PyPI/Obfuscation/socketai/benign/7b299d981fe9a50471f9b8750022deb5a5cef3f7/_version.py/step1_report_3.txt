  "purpose": "Define version information for a Python module or package.",
  "sources": "Initialization of the __version_info__ tuple and reading of it to create __version__ string.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no external input/output operations or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "N/A, as the code only processes predefined variables to generate a version string.",
  "anomalies": "Use of string join with map, which is standard; no unusual code structures, obfuscation, or hidden logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version tuple, then constructs a version string from it. It handles potential 4-element version tuples. No input, no data leaks, no suspicious behavior. No code injection, environment variable misuse, or malicious operations observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward version information setup, with no malicious intent or security issues.",
