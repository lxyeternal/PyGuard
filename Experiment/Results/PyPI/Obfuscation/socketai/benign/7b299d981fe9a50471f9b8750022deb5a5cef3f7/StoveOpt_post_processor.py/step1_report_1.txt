{
  "purpose": "The code is designed for importing, processing, analyzing, and visualizing temperature and velocity data from CFD simulation files stored in a directory structure, aiming to identify optimal parameters for the simulation.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from text files within nested directory paths, especially from 'details' files and temperature probe files in 'foamfiles' subdirectories.",
  "sinks": "Data is stored in numpy arrays and printed to the console; no writing to external systems, databases, or network communications is observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file reading functions (open/read) into numpy arrays and lists, then to processing functions that analyze, sort, and generate results, with no evident data transmission or external network activity.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains verbose print statements for debugging and uses globals() for variable storage, which is unnecessary and potentially risky. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are detected. No obfuscated language features or malicious obfuscation techniques are present.",
  "analysis": "The script systematically reads temperature and velocity data from text files, processes the data through numpy operations, and visualizes results with matplotlib. It does not include network communications, code injection, or system modifications. The use of globals() is inefficient but not malicious. There are no signs of malware such as data exfiltration, remote control, or damaging actions. The code appears to be a legitimate data analysis pipeline with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data processing and analysis script with no malicious behavior detected. It primarily reads simulation data, computes statistical metrics, and visualizes results. There are no indicators of supply chain attacks or malware. The verbose debugging statements and use of globals() are poor practice but not malicious.",
