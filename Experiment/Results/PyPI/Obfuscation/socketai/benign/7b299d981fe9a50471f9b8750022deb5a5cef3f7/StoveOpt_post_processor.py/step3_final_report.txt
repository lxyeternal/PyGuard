{
  "purpose": "The code processes temperature and velocity data from CFD simulation output files, performing data import, averaging, sorting, and plotting for analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads data from text files located in specific directory structures, including 'details' files and temperature probe data files.",
  "sinks": "No external data transmission; all data remains within local files and numpy arrays; no network or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "File paths are constructed and data is read into numpy arrays; data is processed locally through numpy operations, sorting, and plotting functions.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'globals()' for variable assignment and contains verbose print statements; no malicious code or obfuscation detected; some redundant or poorly structured code present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs directory traversal, file reading, data extraction, averaging, sorting, and plotting. No network activity, code injection, or external data exfiltration is evident. The use of 'globals()' and verbose debugging statements are poor practices but not malicious. No signs of backdoors, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code are present. The code is typical for scientific data analysis, with no malicious intent or sabotage detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign scientific data processing script with no signs of malware, sabotage, or supply chain attack vectors. The low security risk score is appropriate, and the malware and obfuscation scores should remain at zero.",
