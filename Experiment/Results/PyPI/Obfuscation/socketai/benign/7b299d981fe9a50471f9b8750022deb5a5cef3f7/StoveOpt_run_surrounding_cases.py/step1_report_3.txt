{
  "purpose": "The code aims to generate and modify boundary condition files for multiple CFD simulation cases with varying secondary airflow velocities, for a model related to combustion or airflow analysis.",
  "sources": "User-defined constants (U_100), function parameters, current working directory via os.getcwd(), and file system operations for reading and writing boundary condition files.",
  "sinks": "File write operations in boundary condition files where velocity data is inserted; these files are intended for CFD boundary conditions.",
  "flows": "Velocity values are calculated and formatted as strings (sources) → boundary condition files are opened and velocities are written into specific positions (sinks) → files are replaced with templates or updated boundary condition data.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains extensive file path manipulations with string concatenation; no validation of file existence or content sanitization; no evidence of input validation or security checks on file paths or content; use of hardcoded file positions (RHS_pos, LHS_pos) which could lead to unintended overwrites; potential to overwrite critical files if misused, but no clear malicious intent; no suspicious network activity, credential handling, or obfuscated code segments; functions are straightforward for file manipulation and calculations.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a utility for automating the setup of boundary condition files for CFD simulations, involving directory navigation, file reading/writing, and velocity calculations. It uses standard Python libraries (os, shutil) for file operations. No network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration routines are present. The code does not perform any malicious actions, such as malware delivery, system damage, or unauthorized data access. It appears to be a domain-specific script for CFD case setup, with no evidence of sabotage or harmful behavior. The operations are conventional, with potential risks only if misused (e.g., overwriting critical files), but this is not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for automating CFD boundary condition setup. There is no indication of malicious behavior or malware. It relies on standard file operations and calculations, with no suspicious or harmful logic detected. The overall security risk is low.",
