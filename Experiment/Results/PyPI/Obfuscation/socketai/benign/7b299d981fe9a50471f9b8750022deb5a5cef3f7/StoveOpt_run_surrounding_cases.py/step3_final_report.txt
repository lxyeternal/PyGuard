  "purpose": "The code calculates and sets boundary velocities for CFD simulations at different secondary airflow rates, locates relevant directories and files, and overwrites specific sections within boundary condition files with new velocity data.",
  "sources": "Reads current working directory, velocity parameters, and boundary condition files; uses fixed byte positions within files for overwriting data.",
  "sinks": "Writes velocity data into boundary condition files at fixed byte positions; copies template files over existing boundary files.",
  "flows": "Calculates velocity strings -> locates directory paths -> opens boundary files -> seeks to fixed positions -> overwrites with velocity data -> copies template files to reset boundary conditions.",
  "anomalies": "Uses fixed byte positions (RHS_pos=893, LHS_pos=1098) for in-place file editing, which can be fragile if file formats change; string slicing may truncate velocity values; path concatenation uses '+' which may be platform-dependent; Windows-style path separator in replace_bc_template() limits cross-platform compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The script performs straightforward file and directory operations tailored for CFD boundary condition setup. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The use of fixed byte positions and string slicing could lead to errors if file formats change, but these are typical in such domain-specific scripts. Path handling could be improved for robustness. No security vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident. The code's purpose is configuration, not security-sensitive, and the operations are contained within local files. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with this analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, domain-specific utility for CFD boundary condition setup. It performs controlled file manipulations without malicious intent. The low security risk scores are justified, and no modifications are necessary. The main concern is operational fragility due to fixed byte positions, not security.",
