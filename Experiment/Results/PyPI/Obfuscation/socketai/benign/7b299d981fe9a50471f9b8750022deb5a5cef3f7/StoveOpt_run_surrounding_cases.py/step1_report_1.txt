  "purpose": "This script prepares and modifies boundary condition files for simulations involving various secondary air flow rates, based on a reference velocity, by locating directories, generating velocity values, and editing boundary condition files accordingly.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current working directory, reads and writes multiple boundary condition files, and reads velocity input parameters.",
  "sinks": "The code writes to boundary condition files (e.g., 'U', 'details') and potentially overwrites existing files with new velocity values.",
  "flows": "Sources include directory paths and velocity parameters; data flows into boundary condition files through file write operations, particularly in 'edit_boundary_conditions' and 'write_velocity_files'.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward file manipulation without obfuscated language or hidden behaviors. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious network activity. It uses hardcoded file paths and filenames but this is typical for configuration scripts. No encryption, obfuscation, or suspicious dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes velocity parameters and computes multiple scaled velocities with string formatting. It locates directories for different simulation cases, constructs file paths, and modifies boundary condition files by overwriting specific sections with new velocity data. The boundary files are replaced with a template via 'copyfile', indicating a reset or update process. No input/output is taken from untrusted sources, and no network or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code is focused on preparing simulation input files without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a configuration utility for setting up simulation boundary conditions with specific velocity parameters. It performs file I/O operations in a controlled and expected manner without malicious intent or security risks. No indicators of malware, backdoors, or security threats are present.",
