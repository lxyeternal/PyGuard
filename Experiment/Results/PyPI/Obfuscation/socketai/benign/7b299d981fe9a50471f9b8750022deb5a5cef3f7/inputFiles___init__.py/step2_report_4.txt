  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the validity of their conclusions, the appropriateness of the scores, and any inconsistencies.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a header comment or placeholder with no executable content.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, which is reasonable given the content.\n- The security risk score is 0, which aligns with the absence of executable code or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Header comment with metadata.\n- **Analysis:** No code, no data flow, no suspicious content.\n- **Conclusion:** No security threat.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n  \n**Assessment:** Fully reasonable. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the script being a header.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.0.\n  \n**Assessment:** Consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- Describes the code as a template or placeholder, no executable logic.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.0.\n  \n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- Same as previous, header-only, no malicious content.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n  \n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but still describes the code as a benign header.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n  \n**Assessment:** Reasonable, given the minimal content.\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusion:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign header comments with no executable or malicious content.\n- The malware scores are appropriately zero.\n- The obfuscated scores are correctly zero.\n- The security risk scores are correctly zero, given the lack of any operational code or suspicious patterns.\n- Confidence levels are high, consistent with the simplicity of the code.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, as no malicious behavior is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, no obfuscation present.\n- **Risk score:** 0, no security risk.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**In summary:** The reports are accurate, well-reasoned, and consistent with the code snippet provided. No changes are necessary.",
