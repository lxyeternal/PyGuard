  "purpose": "This code is a header comment containing metadata such as creation date and author, with no executable code.",
  "sources": "No data sources; only static comments present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code contains only comments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; purely header comments with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a comment block with metadata, with no executable statements, data processing, or network activity. No sources, sinks, or flows are present. The absence of code indicates no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the benign nature. Confidence is high due to the simplicity and clarity of the code. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign header comment with no malicious, obfuscated, or security risks. All scores are appropriately zero, and the confidence level is high. No further action or modifications are necessary.",
