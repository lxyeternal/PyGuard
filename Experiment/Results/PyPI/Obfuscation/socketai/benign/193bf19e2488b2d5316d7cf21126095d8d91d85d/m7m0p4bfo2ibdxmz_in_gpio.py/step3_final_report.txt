  "purpose": "GPIO input handling for media control buttons and volume/list selection on a Raspberry Pi, invoking frontend commands based on button presses.",
  "sources": "GPIO pins configured for input with pull-up resistors; GPIO.input() reads pin states during callbacks.",
  "sinks": "GPIO.input() outputs used as conditions to trigger frontend commands; no external data sinks or network activity detected.",
  "flows": "GPIO input pins -> callback functions -> frontend.zqAEkWjtSJWlTllGcYWQUmLQIhMGdvAc() with command dicts.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable and method names; no malicious code, network activity, or hardcoded credentials observed.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up GPIO pins with event detection and callbacks for media controls. Variable names are intentionally obfuscated, which could be for concealment but does not imply malicious intent. No network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The GPIO handling is standard and secure, with exception handling for permissions. The obfuscation level varies but is consistent with code concealment rather than malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, risk=0.2, obfuscated=0.4-0.8) are appropriate and justified based on the code content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate GPIO interface for media control on Raspberry Pi, with obfuscation but no evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The overall security risk is low, and the code appears safe for use.",
