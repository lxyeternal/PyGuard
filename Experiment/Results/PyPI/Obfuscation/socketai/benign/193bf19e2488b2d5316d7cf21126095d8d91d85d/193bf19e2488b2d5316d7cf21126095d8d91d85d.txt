The high obfuscation and dynamic imports justify a moderate malware suspicion score (~0.5) and a risk score (~0.4). Further runtime and behavioral analysis are recommended to confirm safety."

The malware score is zero, and the security risk is low, primarily due to obfuscation. It should be reviewed with source verification if source trustworthiness is uncertain."
