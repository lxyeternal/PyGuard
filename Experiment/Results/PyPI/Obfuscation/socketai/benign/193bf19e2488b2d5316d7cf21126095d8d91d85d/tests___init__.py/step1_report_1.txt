  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform standard data processing or utility functions within a Python project, with no clear malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables, function parameters, or external files.",
  "sinks": "Data outputs to logs, files, network connections, or database queries.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) through processing functions, potentially reaching sinks such as logs or network transmissions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious URL connections, or obfuscated code detected. The code uses standard library functions and straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "A line-by-line review shows typical Python code structure, with no indicators of malicious behavior. No suspicious network activity, hidden backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. Use of third-party libraries is not inherently suspicious. The code does not perform dangerous operations such as executing shell commands, accessing sensitive system files, or sending data over the network to unknown domains. No unusual or misleading variable names or code constructs are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign Python implementation with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided content. It is safe to assume low maliciousness and security threat levels.",
