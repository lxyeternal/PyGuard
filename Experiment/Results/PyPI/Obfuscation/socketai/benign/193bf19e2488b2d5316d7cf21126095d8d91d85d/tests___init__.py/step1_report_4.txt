  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a utility or script for performing a specific task, possibly related to data processing or network communication, based on the structure and imported modules.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters, environment variables, and possibly external files or network sources (if network code exists).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network sockets, file writes, environment variables, or subprocess calls if present. No explicit untrusted data output points are evident in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (parameters, env vars) through processing functions to sinks such as network or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious variable names, or unusual dynamic code execution observed. The code structure appears straightforward. Lack of comments or documentation might be a concern, but not suspicious per se.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with import statements and function definitions. There are no signs of obfuscation, encrypted payloads, or unusual control flow. No hardcoded secrets or network connections are detected. The logic appears standard and safe. Given the code is minimal and standard, there are no indicators of malicious intent or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malware or malicious behavior. The code seems benign, with no evidence of suspicious data flows, backdoors, or security issues.",
