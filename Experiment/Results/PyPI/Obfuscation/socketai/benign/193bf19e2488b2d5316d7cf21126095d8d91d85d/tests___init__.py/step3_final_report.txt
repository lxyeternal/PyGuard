  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code input, external data handling functions, dynamic code execution points (e.g., eval, exec).",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file system modifications, environment variable access, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Input sources to potential malicious sinks via dynamic code execution or network communication.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable/function names, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), lack of comments, unusual import patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code appears largely benign with straightforward logic, no suspicious network activity, and no obfuscation or malicious payloads. In one report, obfuscation and dynamic features are present, raising suspicion but without concrete malicious actions. Scores are consistent with observations: malware near 0, obfuscation high (~0.7), and low to moderate security risk (~0.2-0.3). The overall assessment indicates low threat, with caution warranted in obfuscated cases. Adjustments are minimal; in particular, lowering malware suspicion in obfuscated code from 0.2 to 0.1 aligns better with the absence of confirmed malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "Most code is safe with low malware and security risks. Obfuscation in some snippets warrants cautious scoring but does not confirm malicious intent. Overall, the dependency appears low risk, with recommended monitoring if further obfuscated or dynamic code is introduced.",
