  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard setup script reading environment variables, package info.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Writes metadata files, creates directories, debug print statements.\n- **Anomalies:** Obfuscated function manipulating filenames, debug info output, inconsistent variable names.\n- **Analysis:** Functionally, the script compiles Cython extensions, generates metadata, and manages dependencies—typical for a build script. The obfuscated function modifies source filenames based on language, which seems benign. No network activity, no data exfiltration, no malicious code detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Overall, a legitimate build script with obfuscation but no malicious activity. Risk is low.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0.7 (high, due to obfuscation)  \n- Risk: 0.2 (low, standard build process)  \n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar build and packaging setup, with environment variables.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** File writes, directory creation, no external network.\n- **Anomalies:** Heavy obfuscation, function names, and variable names; complex filename handling.\n- **Analysis:** No network or malicious code; obfuscation might be to hide proprietary logic or prevent analysis. The filename modification function is not inherently malicious.\n- **Conclusion:** Likely a legitimate, albeit obfuscated, build script. No malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0.1 (very low)  \n- Obfuscated: 0.9 (very high) due to obfuscation)  \n- Risk: 0.2\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Metadata files, build flags.\n- **Anomalies:** Obfuscated function, debug print statements, no validation.\n- **Analysis:** No network or malicious activity. Obfuscation is prominent but seems to serve code concealment rather than malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard build script with obfuscation; low security risk.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0.7  \n- Risk: 0.2\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar build setup.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Metadata files, directory creation, debug info.\n- **Anomalies:** Unused obfuscated function, debug print statements.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity; code appears to be a typical build script with some unnecessary or leftover code.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, low risk.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0.2 (less obfuscated)  \n- Risk: 0.2\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard build setup.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Metadata files, build flags.\n- **Anomalies:** Obfuscated function name, no validation.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity; obfuscation is present but seems to be for concealment.\n- **Conclusion:** Low security risk, typical build script.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0.4  \n- Risk: 0.2\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity. The highest malware score is 0.1, which is negligible.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** High across reports, ranging from 0.2 to 0.9, indicating code obfuscation is significant.\n- **Risk Score:** Consistently low (~0.2), as the code performs standard build tasks without malicious intent.\n\n### **Final Expert Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0.7** — the code is heavily obfuscated, which could hinder analysis but does not necessarily imply malicious intent.\n- **Risk:** **0.2** — typical build process with obfuscation, no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard package setup script with heavy obfuscation. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The obfuscation might be to protect proprietary logic or hinder reverse engineering but does not inherently indicate malicious intent. The overall security risk remains low.",
