  "conclusion": "The code is a standard dependency import and error handling routine with moderate obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The current malware score of 0 is appropriate, the obfuscation score around 0.6 reflects variable naming, and the security risk score of 0.2 is justified. The detailed error messages could leak internal info but are typical for dependency management. Overall, the code appears safe and benign."
