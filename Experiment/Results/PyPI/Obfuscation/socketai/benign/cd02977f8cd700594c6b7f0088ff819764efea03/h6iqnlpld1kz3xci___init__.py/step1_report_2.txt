{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific modules and metadata, and conditionally imports a Cython extension, handling ImportError with a version check.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (`pyarrow`, `pyarrow.parquet`, and local metadata), reads `__dependencies__` and `__version__`, and potentially reads the error message during import failure.",
  "sinks": "The code raises ImportError with detailed messages, which could expose internal version info if an exception occurs.",
  "flows": "Import attempt of `pyarrow_cython` -> Error handling branch checks the exception message and dependency info -> raises detailed ImportError if dependencies are not met.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variable names (e.g., `oWHajlyOBrfqOIzluqebLiMdJTiDEUJg`, `WylCxzPicuehyOHLTwEqnCmqgLWDlPCV`), dynamic exception message composition revealing internal info, and exception handling logic based on string matching. No suspicious code injection or malicious code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs module imports and error handling. It attempts to import a Cython extension and, if it fails, checks whether the failure is related to 'arrow' or 'parquet' modules by inspecting the exception message. If so, it raises a detailed ImportError that includes current package version, dependency info, and the installed `pyarrow` version. The obfuscated variable names and detailed error message could potentially be used to leak internal package details, but no malicious behavior or malware is present. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or harmful code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard dependency import with error handling, albeit with obfuscated variable names and detailed error messages that could leak internal info. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
