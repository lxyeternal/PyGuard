{
  "purpose": "The code manages dependencies for pyarrow and handles import errors with detailed messages, including version info.",
  "sources": "Import statements for pyarrow, pyarrow.parquet, and local package metadata; conditional import of a cython extension with exception handling.",
  "sinks": "Error message formatting potentially exposing internal version and dependency info.",
  "flows": "Import attempt → exception handling → error message construction and raising.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obscure variable names; detailed error messages that could leak internal info; string matching in exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard dependency imports with error handling. Obfuscated variable names are present but do not indicate malicious intent. Error messages include internal version info, which could be sensitive but is typical in dependency management routines. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code is evident. The exception handling inspects error messages for specific module names, which is common. The obfuscation level is moderate, justified by variable naming, but does not suggest malware. Overall, the code is benign, with low security risk and no malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard dependency import and error handling routine with moderate obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The current malware score of 0 is appropriate, the obfuscation score around 0.6 reflects variable naming, and the security risk score of 0.2 is justified. The detailed error messages could leak internal info but are typical for dependency management. Overall, the code appears safe and benign.",
