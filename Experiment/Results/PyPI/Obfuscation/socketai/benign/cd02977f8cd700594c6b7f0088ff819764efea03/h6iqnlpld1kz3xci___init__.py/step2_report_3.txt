  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code, the described logic, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code imports pyarrow modules, attempts to import a Cython extension, and handles ImportError by inspecting the message for 'arrow' or 'parquet'. If so, it raises a detailed ImportError with version info. Variable names are obscure, but behavior is standard.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis; no malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.2 — some obfuscation noted, but minimal.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — low, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores seem reasonable. The code is standard dependency handling with minor obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar dependency import and error handling with obfuscated variable names. Exception message includes internal info, which could leak details but isn't malicious.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.8 — high obfuscation, as noted.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — low, mainly due to obfuscation and info leakage potential.\n\n**Verdict:** The high obfuscation score is justified. No evidence of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard import routines, with detailed error messages, no suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation mentioned.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — no risks identified.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Dependency import with obfuscated variable names, standard error handling, no malicious activity. Obfuscation noted but no malicious intent.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.8 — high obfuscation, justified.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, mainly due to obfuscation.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Dependency management with obfuscated variables, error handling, potential for hiding malicious intent but no evidence of malicious code.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.6 — moderate obfuscation, possibly suspicious but not malicious.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — low.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, which is consistent with the analysis; no malicious code or behavior is evident.\n\n- **Obfuscated scores:** Ranging from 0.2 to 0.8, matching the variable naming and exception message complexity.\n\n- **Risk scores:** Generally low, reflecting the benign nature of the code, with some concern about obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\nGiven the consistent pattern across reports, I would assign:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.6 — moderate obfuscation present, but not necessarily malicious.\n\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — low, primarily due to obfuscation and potential info leakage.\n\n**Final notes:** The code appears to be standard dependency management with some obfuscation. No malware or malicious intent is evident. The obfuscation could be a concern but isn't necessarily malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|----------|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 1        | 0       | 0.2          | 0.2   |\n| 2        | 0       | 0.8          | 0.2   |\n| 3        | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 4        | 0       | 0.8          | 0.1   |\n| 5        | 0       | 0.6          | 0.2   |\n\nMy overall estimate: **Malware=0, Obfuscated=0.6, Risk=0.2**.",
