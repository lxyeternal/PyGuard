  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checkting the code, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code performs standard dependency import routines with error handling.\n- Obfuscated variable names (e.g., `oWHajlyOBrfqOIzluqebLiMdJTiDEUJg`, `WylCxzPicuehyOHLTwEqnCmqgLWDlPCV`, `UpQwcbtqOeetDpRkfcXdkRCAngWDFEUH`) are present, which is unusual but not inherently malicious.\n- Exception handling inspects exception messages, potentially to identify specific missing modules or version mismatches.\n- Error messages include internal version info and dependency details, which could be considered sensitive if exposed unintentionally.\n- No evidence of network activity, code injection, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correctly describes the code's dependency management and error handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0.2, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The low malware score aligns with the analysis. The obfuscation is minor; the code's purpose is standard. The security risk is low, given no malicious activity.\n\n**Conclusion:** The scores seem reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Focuses on obfuscated variable names and detailed error messages. Correctly notes the potential info leak.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0.8, risk=0.2, confidence=0.8.\n- **Assessment:** The high obfuscation score is justified given the variable names. No malware is detected, and the risk remains low. The detailed error messages could be a minor concern but are typical for dependency checks.\n\n**Conclusion:** The high obfuscation score is justified; the malware score remains zero. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Highlights standard import routines, with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Perfect confidence and no obfuscation or malware concerns. The low risk score is appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Similar to others, notes obfuscated variable names but no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0.8, risk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Obfuscation is high, but no malware detected. The low risk score is consistent.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Recognizes standard dependency import with some obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0.6, risk=0.2, confidence=0.7.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly lower confidence but still reasonable. Obfuscation is moderate, no malware.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** Slight variation, justified by variable naming.\n- **Risk scores:** All low, reflecting the code's benign nature.\n- **Confidence levels:** High across reports, aligning with the detailed reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### **My final estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** ~0.6 (moderate obfuscation, mostly variable names)\n- **Risk:** ~0.2 (low risk, dependency management routine)\n\nThe reports' scores are consistent with the code and analysis. No significant adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard dependency import and error handling routine with obfuscated variable names but no evidence of malicious activity. The scores reflect this understanding accurately.",
