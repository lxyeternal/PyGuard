{
  "purpose": "The code imports the pyarrow library and related modules, and conditionally imports a cython extension, handling import errors with specific messages.",
  "sources": "Import statements and the exception handling block that accesses exception message strings.",
  "sinks": "Exception message formatting that incorporates the original exception string.",
  "flows": "Exception string from ImportError -> error message formatting -> raised exception.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obscure variable names and string concatenation within exception handling; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious data sources.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing external libraries (pyarrow and pyarrow.parquet), then attempts to import a local cython extension. If the import fails, it examines the exception message to determine if the failure relates to 'arrow' or 'parquet'. If so, it searches for the installed pyarrow version in dependencies and raises a detailed ImportError message indicating version mismatch. The code's structure and variable naming are unusual but not malicious; it handles dependencies and errors carefully. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or suspicious behavior are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard dependency management and error handling without evidence of malicious activity. Its unusual variable names and exception message handling are non-standard but do not indicate malware or security risks.",
