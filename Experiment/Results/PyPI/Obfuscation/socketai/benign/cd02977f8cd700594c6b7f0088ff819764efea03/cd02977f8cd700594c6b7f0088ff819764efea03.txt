      "conclusion": "The code does not contain malicious payloads or behavior but exhibits obfuscation and resource usage that could be exploited for denial of service or covert data storage. The malware score is low (0.2), reflecting no active malicious intent. The obfuscation score is moderate to high (around 0.4 to 0.7), justified by variable naming and code complexity. The security risk score is moderate (around 0.4), primarily due to resource exhaustion potential. Overall, the code appears benign but warrants caution in resource-sensitive environments."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, albeit obfuscated, testing suite for data and metadata verification. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or supply chain compromise. The obfuscation is likely for concealment or complexity, not malicious intent. Malware score is set to 0, security risk is low (~0.2), and obfuscation is moderate (~0.7)."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a standard dependency import and error handling routine with moderate obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The current malware score of 0 is appropriate, the obfuscation score around 0.6 reflects variable naming, and the security risk score of 0.2 is justified. The detailed error messages could leak internal info but are typical for dependency management. Overall, the code appears safe and benign."
