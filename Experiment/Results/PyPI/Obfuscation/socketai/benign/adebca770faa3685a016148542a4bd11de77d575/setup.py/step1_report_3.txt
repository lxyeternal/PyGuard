{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package, defining package metadata, dependencies, and repository links.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description, reading 'requirements.txt' for dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted external data or user input.",
  "flows": "Data read from files used for package configuration; no data flows into sensitive functions or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The script reads from local files ('README.md' and 'requirements.txt') and uses the data to configure the package setup via setuptools. The URLs are constructed using hardcoded strings, which are benign in this context. No code executes untrusted input, performs network operations, or contains obfuscated or malicious logic. The overall structure is typical for a setup script, with non-standard variable names but no suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. Variable naming is unconventional but not malicious. No external or untrusted data is processed in a way that introduces security concerns.",
