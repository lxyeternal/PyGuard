  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package, defining metadata, dependencies, and URLs for documentation, source code, and issue tracker.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; reads 'requirements.txt' for dependencies; assigns static strings for URLs and package info.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly identified; no untrusted data is processed or executed, no user input handled.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows to sensitive operations or system commands; static strings used for URLs and package info.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names; no clear malicious activity or suspicious code structure. All code appears standard for package setup.",
  "analysis": "Code reads local files ('README.md' and 'requirements.txt') for package metadata and dependencies, then uses setuptools to define package metadata and URLs. Variable names are intentionally obfuscated, but the code is straightforward and typical of package setup scripts. No dynamic code execution, no network calls beyond static URL assignments, and no handling of untrusted input.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with obfuscated variable names. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. It appears to be a benign setup configuration for a Sphinx extension package.",
