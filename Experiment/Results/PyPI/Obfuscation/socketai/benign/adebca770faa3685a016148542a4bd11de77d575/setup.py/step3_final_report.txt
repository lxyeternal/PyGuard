  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for a Python package, configuring package metadata, reading README and requirements files, and constructing URLs for documentation and source repositories.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' and 'requirements.txt' files, constructs URLs from static strings, and passes data to setuptools.setup()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network calls, code execution, or data exfiltration present",
  "flows": "Reads local files and constructs URLs; no flow of untrusted data into sensitive operations",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, but no malicious or suspicious code patterns; URLs are static and legitimate",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard package setup with obfuscated variable names. It performs file reads and URL constructions without executing code or fetching remote data. No hardcoded secrets or malicious behaviors are detected. The obfuscation appears superficial, likely for concealment, but does not imply malicious intent. The code's benign nature is consistent across multiple reviews.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with high obfuscation but no malicious activity or security risks. The obfuscation is superficial and does not impact security. Overall, the package is safe to use.",
