{
  "purpose": "Define a class that inherits from Attribute, with a default boolean value, and specify exported names.",
  "sources": "The code reads an import statement from 'pyAttributes' and defines a list containing a string.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling points where untrusted data could cause harm are present.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to class inheritance and attribute assignment within the class constructor.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable name for the list, which contains only a string. No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from an external module, defines a list of attribute names, and declares a subclass that initializes a boolean attribute with a default value. The code appears to be straightforward, with no evident malicious behavior or suspicious patterns. There are no external network operations, data leaks, or obfuscated logic. The naming conventions are unusual but not inherently malicious. The code primarily sets up a class structure without any malicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign class definition and export setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
