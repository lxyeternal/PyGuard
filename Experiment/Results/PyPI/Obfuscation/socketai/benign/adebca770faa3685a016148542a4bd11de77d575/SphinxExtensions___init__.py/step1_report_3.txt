{
  "purpose": "Defines a list of attribute names and a class inheriting from Attribute, with a default boolean value.",
  "sources": "Import from pyAttributes, instantiation of qZmRZfFajSDCfVWCvfgczOvwOMGWaOCw class.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no data flows into external systems or outputs.",
  "flows": "Import source → class definition → class instantiation and attribute assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class name; no external data inputs or outputs; no hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code imports an attribute class, defines a list of attribute names, and creates a subclass with a default boolean property. No data is read from untrusted sources, no external connections, and no suspicious code execution observed. The class appears to be a standard attribute wrapper with obfuscated naming, which might hinder readability but does not indicate malicious intent. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward class definition with obfuscated naming, likely for internal use or code organization. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident.",
