{
  "purpose": "Define a Python class that inherits from Attribute, with a default boolean value, and specify public API elements.",
  "sources": "Import statement from pyAttributes; class constructor with default value; module-level variables (__all__).",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or outputs.",
  "flows": "Input (imported module, default value) -> class instantiation -> class attribute assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable name (YCFMOYPPnmGwQVsHJeXnSVVldHGxowfi), unconventional naming, but no suspicious logic. No hardcoded credentials or secret data. The class appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Attribute from a module, defines a list with a string, and sets __all__ for module exports. It then defines a class inheriting from Attribute, with an __init__ method that sets a boolean value. No untrusted input handling, no external data flows, and no suspicious code constructs are present. The variable names are obscure but do not suggest malicious intent. The code structure is simple and typical for class definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard class definition with obfuscated variable names but no malicious or suspicious behavior. It does not perform any data leaks, malicious actions, or security-critical operations.",
