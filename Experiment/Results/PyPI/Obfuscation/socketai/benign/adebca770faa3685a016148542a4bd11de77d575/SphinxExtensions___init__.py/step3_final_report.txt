  "purpose": "Define a list of attribute names and a class inheriting from Attribute with a default boolean value.",
  "sources": "Import from pyAttributes; class constructor setting self.value; list containing attribute name.",
  "sinks": "None; code does not process untrusted input or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "Import -> class definition -> setting self.value; list -> __all__ assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and class names; no external data handling or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward class definition with obfuscated naming, importing Attribute, defining a list, and exporting the class. No suspicious logic, external data flows, or malicious behavior are present. Obfuscation appears to be for concealment or internal organization rather than malicious intent. The malware score is zero, risk is minimal, and obfuscation is moderate, justified by naming. No vulnerabilities or malicious activities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a simple attribute class with obfuscated identifiers. No malicious or security-critical issues are detected. Obfuscation does not imply malicious intent in this context.",
