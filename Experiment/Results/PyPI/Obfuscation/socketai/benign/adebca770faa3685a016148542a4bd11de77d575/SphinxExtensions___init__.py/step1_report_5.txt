  "purpose": "Define a class inheriting from pyAttributes.Attribute with a boolean property and expose a list of attribute names.",
  "sources": "Import from pyAttributes module, assignment to YCFMOYPPnmGwQVsHJeXnSVVldHGxowfi, class instantiation of qZmRZfFajSDCfVWCvfgczOvwOMGWaOCw",
  "sinks": "Super().__init__() call, setting self.value, module export via __all__",
  "flows": "Import from pyAttributes -> class instantiation -> setting self.value -> export via __all__",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, no clear purpose beyond class definition, no use of external input or sensitive data",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from an external module, defines a list with a single string, and creates a subclass with a simple boolean attribute. Variable names appear obfuscated, possibly to hide intent, but there is no evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity, data leakage, or backdoors. The class seems to serve as a data structure or configuration element. No suspicious code execution or external communication is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with obfuscated naming likely for code organization or concealment, but no malicious or security-threatening behavior detected. It is a straightforward class definition and export.",
