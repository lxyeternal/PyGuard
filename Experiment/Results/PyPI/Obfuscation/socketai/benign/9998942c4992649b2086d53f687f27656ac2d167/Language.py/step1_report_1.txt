  "purpose": "Define a class representing languages with associated codes and instantiate common language objects.",
  "sources": "Class constructor (__init__) method for creating language objects, assignments creating language instances with string parameters.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or untrusted data usage detected.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of class objects using hardcoded string literals; no external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class name and variable names, but no malicious or suspicious behavior evident. No hardcoded secrets, no network, or system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with two attributes and creates four instances with predefined language names and codes. The code appears to serve as a data structure setup without any input/output operations or suspicious activity. Variable names are obfuscated but do not suggest malicious intent. No external data sources or sinks are used. The logic is straightforward and solely involves object creation with string literals.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, non-malicious language data setup with obfuscated naming. No malware, suspicious behavior, or security risks are evident.",
