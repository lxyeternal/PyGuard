  "purpose": "Define a class representing languages with language names and ISO codes, and create class instances for specific languages.",
  "sources": "Instantiation of class objects with string parameters for language names and ISO codes.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; straightforward class instantiation with hardcoded data.",
  "anomalies": "Class name is obfuscated; however, the code simply defines a class and creates instances with static data; no suspicious or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with two attributes, then creates four instances for specific languages with their names and ISO codes. The class name appears obfuscated, but the logic is straightforward and only involves static data assignment. No external data sources, network activity, or sensitive data handling is present. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage, nor any suspicious dynamic code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving a simple purpose of defining language objects with static data. There are no indications of malicious intent, data leaks, or security risks.",
