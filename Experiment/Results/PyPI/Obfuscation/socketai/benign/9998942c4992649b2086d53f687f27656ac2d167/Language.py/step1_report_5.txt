  "purpose": "Define a class representing language data with specific language instances",
  "sources": "Initialization of class instances with language name and ISO code",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or external data output",
  "flows": "Creation of class instances from hardcoded strings during class initialization",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class and variable names; no sensitive data or suspicious behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with obfuscated naming, then creates static instances representing various languages. There are no external data reads, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, or malicious patterns. The purpose appears to be merely data encapsulation for language information.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a data structure with predefined language instances. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
