{
  "purpose": "Define a class representing languages with associated names and ISO2 codes, and create static instances for specific languages.",
  "sources": "Class constructor (__init__) initializing name and iso2 from parameters; static instance assignments setting language instances with string parameters.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling detected; no output or external data interactions observed.",
  "flows": "Initialization flows from constructor to static instance assignments, with hardcoded language data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors present; the code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for language representation, then creates four static instances with language names and ISO2 codes. There is no dynamic input, no network or file I/O, and no obfuscation. It appears to be purely data modeling. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple language data container with static instances; it shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
