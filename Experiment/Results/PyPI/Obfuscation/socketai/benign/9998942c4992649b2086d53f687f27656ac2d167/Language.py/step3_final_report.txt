  "purpose": "Defines a class representing language data with obfuscated class and attribute names, then creates static instances for different languages.",
  "sources": "Static string literals used in class instantiation for language names and ISO codes.",
  "sinks": "No external data sources, network activity, or data leaks; static data only.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of class objects with static data; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names; no other unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple data container class with obfuscated naming, then creates four instances with language names and ISO codes. There are no external inputs, network calls, or dynamic behaviors. The obfuscation is superficial and does not imply malicious intent. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation scores are justified given the naming, but the logic remains benign. Malware scores are zero, and security risk scores are zero, aligning with the benign nature. The obfuscation score could be slightly increased in the case of the fourth report to reflect the obfuscated class and variable names, but overall, the assessments are consistent and accurate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static, obfuscated data structure for language information with no malicious or security risks. The reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the scoring aligns with the analysis. No further security concerns are present.",
