{
  "purpose": "Defines a class for language objects with name and ISO2 code and initializes some language instances.",
  "sources": "Class constructor (__init__) which takes name and iso2 as input; attribute assignments; class variable initializations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data affects external systems or causes harm; no data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Input data (name, iso2) flow into class constructor, then into class variables without any external data sources or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The class and variable naming are obfuscated, but the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with two attributes and creates instances representing different languages. There are no external inputs, network calls, or suspicious behaviors. The obfuscated class name and variable names do not indicate malicious intent but are unusual. Overall, the code appears to serve as a simple data structure for language info, with no malicious or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of a class with instances representing languages. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation seems to be for obfuscation purposes only, not malicious intent.",
