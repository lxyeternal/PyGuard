  "purpose": "Analyze import statements with obfuscated identifiers to assess potential malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Imported modules from utils_lang with obfuscated or nonsensical identifiers.",
  "sinks": "No data flows, network activity, or code execution observed; potential risk if modules are malicious but not evident here.",
  "flows": "Import statements are static; no runtime data flow or untrusted input handling present.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated import identifiers, which could be used to hide malicious code or backdoors; no active malicious code detected in snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with obfuscated module and class names. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activity is evident. Obfuscation raises suspicion but is not proof of malicious intent. Scores for malware are low (0.1-0.2), reflecting the lack of evidence. Obfuscation scores are high (0.7-0.8), justified by the nonsensical identifiers. Security risk scores are low (0.1-0.3), consistent with the benign nature of static imports. Confidence in benign assessment is high (around 0.8-0.9).",
  "conclusion": "The import statements are obfuscated but do not demonstrate malicious activity or security risks based solely on this snippet. Obfuscation warrants further review of the actual modules, but current evidence suggests minimal threat.",
