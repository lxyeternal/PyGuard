  "purpose": "Importing specific functions or classes from modules within the utils_lang package, likely for language processing tasks such as language detection, translation, and text-to-speech.",
  "sources": "Import statements from utils_lang.Language, utils_lang.Translator, and utils_lang.TTS modules",
  "sinks": "No evident sink that processes untrusted data; the code only performs imports",
  "flows": "No data flow detected; only static imports without data processing or external communication",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements importing specific functions or classes from three modules within a package. No data input, processing, or external communication occurs. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as sending data externally, executing untrusted code, or handling sensitive information in an insecure manner.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, performing only import operations with no malicious intent or security risks evident.",
