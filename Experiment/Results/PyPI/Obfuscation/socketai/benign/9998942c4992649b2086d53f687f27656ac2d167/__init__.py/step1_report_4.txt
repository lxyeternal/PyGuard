{
  "purpose": "Import specific functions or classes from modules within the 'utils_lang' package, likely related to language processing, translation, and text-to-speech.",
  "sources": "Import statements that load functions/classes from 'utils_lang.Language', 'utils_lang.Translator', and 'utils_lang.TTS' modules.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks identified; the code does not perform any data output, network requests, or system modifications within this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted input sources to sensitive sinks observed; the imports are static and do not involve dynamic code execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected in these import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements importing functions or classes with seemingly random names from a local package. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or malicious code execution. The imported names appear to be obfuscated or auto-generated, but this alone is not suspicious without further context. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling observed.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this snippet, the code appears to be standard import statements with obfuscated function/class names. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leakage, or security risks within this code fragment.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.8,
