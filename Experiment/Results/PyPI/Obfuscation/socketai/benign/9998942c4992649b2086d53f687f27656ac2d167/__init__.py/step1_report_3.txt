  "purpose": "Importing specific functions or variables from modules within the utils_lang package, likely for language processing tasks.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'utils_lang.Language', 'utils_lang.Translator', and 'utils_lang.TTS' modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks detected; no data flows or untrusted data handling present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; imported symbols are assigned to local variables but not used within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Importing what appear to be obfuscated or nonsensical identifiers, which could suggest obfuscation or hiding intent. No direct malicious code, but unusual naming raises suspicion.",
  "analysis": "The code imports three symbols from modules within the utils_lang package. The identifiers are nonsensical, which could indicate obfuscation or an attempt to hide malicious intent. No functions are called, no data input or output is shown, and no malicious actions are evident in this fragment. The code alone does not perform any malicious behavior but the obfuscated nature warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a simple import statement with obfuscated identifiers, which alone does not indicate malicious behavior. However, the unusual naming suggests potential obfuscation. No active malicious actions or data flows are present in this fragment.",
