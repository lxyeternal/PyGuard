{
  "purpose": "Import specific functions or classes from a package named utils_lang, possibly for language processing, translation, and TTS functionalities.",
  "sources": "Import statements reading modules from utils_lang package.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks or data flows involving untrusted input or external data.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow present; only static imports.",
  "anomalies": "Imported symbols have obfuscated or non-descriptive names, which is unusual but not inherently malicious; no code execution or dynamic behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of three import statements importing what appear to be obfuscated class or function names from a package named utils_lang. There are no functions, method calls, or data handling. The symbols are non-descriptive, which could be a sign of obfuscation but may also be a naming convention. No suspicious network, file, or environment access observed. Without additional code, no malicious behavior can be inferred. The imports themselves are static and benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The obfuscated names do not imply malicious intent; they may be part of normal obfuscated code or a coding style. No security risks are apparent from these import statements alone.",
