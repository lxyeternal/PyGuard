      "conclusion": "The code functions as a module management utility with obfuscation and controlled dynamic import. No active malicious activity is detected. The obfuscation and dynamic import patterns warrant caution, especially if inputs are untrusted. The undefined variable 'name' indicates possible obfuscation or a bug, which should be corrected but does not imply malicious intent. Overall, the code is low risk but should be reviewed for input validation and clarity."

      "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated Easter date calculator with no evidence of malicious activity. The high obfuscation score is justified, but the malware score remains at 0. The low security risk score is appropriate given the benign purpose. Overall, the code appears to implement a known algorithm for calculating Easter dates, with obfuscation serving as concealment rather than malicious intent."

The high obfuscation is likely for code protection rather than malicious purposes. The malware score is 0, and the overall security risk is low."

Further investigation of the '.tz.win' module content is necessary to assess actual risks."
