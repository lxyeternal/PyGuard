  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated Easter date calculator with no evidence of malicious activity. The high obfuscation score is justified, but the malware score remains at 0. The low security risk score is appropriate given the benign purpose. Overall, the code appears to implement a known algorithm for calculating Easter dates, with obfuscation serving as concealment rather than malicious intent."
