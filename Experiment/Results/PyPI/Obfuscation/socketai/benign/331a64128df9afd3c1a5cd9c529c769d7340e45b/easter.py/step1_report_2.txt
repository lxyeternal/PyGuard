  "flows": "Input parameter -> calculations within function -> return datetime object",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are obfuscated, no direct use of external data or environment variables, but the code performs complex calculations which could mask malicious intent",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to compute Easter date based on various methods, with heavily obfuscated variable names and mathematical calculations that follow known Easter algorithms. The calculations involve modular arithmetic and date component computations. No external data input, network activity, or system modifications are evident. The purpose appears to be a standard Easter date calculation, but the obfuscation and complexity could be used to hide malicious intent, though none is explicitly detected. The code does not include network activity, file operations, or credential handling. The only potential concern is the obfuscation, which might be used to hide malicious logic, but no malicious behavior is explicitly present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to implement a mathematical algorithm for calculating Easter dates with obfuscated variable names. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The obfuscation could be suspicious, but the core logic seems legitimate. Overall, it seems to be a benign Easter calculation function with no malware detected.",
