  "purpose": "Calculate Easter date based on different methods, using complex and obfuscated logic.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'MnbWwEatKqadJfySrnUiNcxhbEwtuVHz' in function 'vPJXqRAPQTulGGMBCZsncMroyCadEyTg'.",
  "sinks": "Return statement constructs a datetime object; no external data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Input parameter -> internal calculations -> datetime object returned.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are heavily obfuscated, with no meaningful identifiers. The code contains complex, convoluted calculations that seem unnecessary, indicating potential obfuscation. No explicit hardcoded credentials or suspicious network activities are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines obfuscated variables and performs complex date calculations, seemingly to compute Easter dates using different algorithms. The logic involves mathematical operations and modular arithmetic without external input or output beyond returning a datetime object. The variable and function names are nonsensical, which suggests obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoors. The complex calculations appear to serve only to obscure the logic, but no malicious intent is evident. Overall, the code appears to be a deliberately obfuscated Easter date calculator with no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is an obfuscated implementation of Easter date calculation with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation appears intentional, likely to conceal simple logic. No malware or malicious activities are detected.",
