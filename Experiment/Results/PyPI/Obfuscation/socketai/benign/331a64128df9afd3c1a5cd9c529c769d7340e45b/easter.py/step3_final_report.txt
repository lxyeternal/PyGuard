  "purpose": "Obfuscated calculation of Easter date based on input year and method, likely implementing known computus algorithms.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'MnbWwEatKqadJfySrnUiNcxhbEwtuVHz' (year), internal variables derived from year calculations.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write to external systems, network, or files.",
  "flows": "Input year -> complex mathematical operations -> final datetime object with calculated year, month, day.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with nonsensical variable and function names; complex nested calculations that appear unnecessary for straightforward Easter date computation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs complex modular arithmetic and nested calculations consistent with known algorithms for computing Easter dates. The obfuscation appears intentional to conceal simplicity. No network, file, or external data access is present. The logic aligns with standard computus algorithms, and no malicious patterns such as data exfiltration, code injection, or system modification are detected. The high obfuscation score is justified, but the malware score remains low due to the benign nature of the calculations. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to obfuscation, which could be used to hide malicious intent but does not do so here.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated Easter date calculator with no evidence of malicious activity. The high obfuscation score is justified, but the malware score remains at 0. The low security risk score is appropriate given the benign purpose. Overall, the code appears to implement a known algorithm for calculating Easter dates, with obfuscation serving as concealment rather than malicious intent.",
