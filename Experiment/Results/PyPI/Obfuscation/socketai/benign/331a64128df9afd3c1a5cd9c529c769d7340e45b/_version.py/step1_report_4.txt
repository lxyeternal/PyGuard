  "flows": "Simple assignment; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names that appear random or obfuscated, but no malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string and a version tuple to variables with non-descriptive, seemingly random names. The variables are used solely for storing version info, which is standard practice. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data leakage. The naming may suggest obfuscation, but without additional context, it appears to be just obscure variable naming.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and solely sets version information with unusual variable names. No malicious intent detected.",
