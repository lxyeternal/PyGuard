  "sources": "Assignment statements assigning static string and tuple to variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; simple variable assignments.",
  "anomalies": "Variables are assigned obfuscated-looking names with no context; the code is minimal and appears intentionally obscure, but there's no evidence of malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string '2.9.0.post0' to a variable with an obfuscated name, and similarly assigns a version tuple (2, 9, 0) to another obfuscated variable. There are no data inputs, external calls, or dynamic behaviors. The obfuscated variable names could suggest an attempt at hiding intent, but the actual content is benign and standard for version specification. There are no signs of malicious activity, such as network calls, credential handling, or hidden payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple variable assignment for version information with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this fragment.",
