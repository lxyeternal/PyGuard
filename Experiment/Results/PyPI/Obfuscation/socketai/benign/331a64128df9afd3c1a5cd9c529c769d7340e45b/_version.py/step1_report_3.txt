  "purpose": "Assign version strings and tuples to variables, likely for package versioning.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting version and version_tuple variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Variables are assigned static string and tuple values; no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names with seemingly random strings; no clear purpose or context provided. No secrets or hardcoded credentials evident.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string and a version tuple to variables with obfuscated or nonsensical names. There is no external input, no data manipulation, no security-sensitive operations, and no suspicious behavior. The variable naming does not suggest malicious intent but may indicate obfuscation or generated code. Overall, the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is simple variable assignment for versioning with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The unusual variable names do not imply malicious intent but could be obfuscation. No malicious or security concerns are evident.",
