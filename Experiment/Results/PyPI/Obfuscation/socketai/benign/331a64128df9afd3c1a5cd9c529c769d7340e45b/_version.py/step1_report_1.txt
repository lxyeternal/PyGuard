  "purpose": "The code appears to define version information for a software package.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version string and version tuple variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or data leakage points identified.",
  "flows": "Assignment of version string to version variables.",
  "anomalies": "Repeated variable assignments, no meaningful processing or logic, no dynamic or external data sources, no use of environment variables or user input.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string and a version tuple to variables, with no external input, no malicious functions, and no suspicious code. The redundancy in variable assignments is benign and typical for version declaration in Python modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward declaration of version information, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is likely part of a package's versioning metadata.",
