  "purpose": "Assigns version information to variables with obfuscated names.",
  "sources": "Variables assigned with static version string and tuple.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external inputs; no data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "Assignment of version string and tuple to variables; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, but no malicious or suspicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward assignment of version info to variables with obfuscated names. There are no external inputs, dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks. The obfuscation appears superficial, possibly stylistic or generated, but does not indicate malicious intent. The variable names are nonsensical but benign. The malware score is zero, and the security risk is minimal (around 0.1), primarily due to obfuscation but no actual security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign version declaration snippet with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
