  "purpose": "Assigning version information to variables",
  "sources": "No external input sources; static variable assignments",
  "sinks": "No sinks, no data output or external interactions",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names that appear nonsensical; no meaningful purpose evident",
  "analysis": "The code assigns version strings and tuples to variables with random-looking names. There are no external inputs, no data processing, and no interaction with files, networks, or sensitive data. The variable names are obfuscated or nonsensical, but this alone does not indicate malicious intent. There are no security issues or malicious behaviors present.",
  "conclusion": "This code only contains straightforward variable assignments for version information using obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
