  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated with suspicious imports and undefined methods, indicating potential concealment of malicious intent. However, no direct malicious activity such as network communication or data theft is evident. The current scores appropriately reflect high obfuscation but low confirmed malware. Further dynamic analysis is recommended if this code is part of a larger, executable environment."
