  "anomalies": "Invalid import from 'rnmCLoJpddTIgFHlSLFrbNgoSxdzjKGW'; calls to undefined method 'IrcZpPZjzhQPUPDnmscBnbYJeEhDzwzu()'; nonsensical variable and function names.",
  "analysis": "The code performs date/time operations with obfuscated identifiers and calls to non-existent methods, indicating obfuscation or corruption. The suspicious import and undefined method suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent or simply obfuscate. No network activity, data exfiltration, or system modification is evident. The obfuscation and invalid imports are red flags but do not confirm malicious behavior. The code's logic is benign but intentionally obscured, raising suspicion. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0.2-0.3, obfuscated 0.8, risk 0.3-0.4) are consistent with the observed anomalies and lack of active malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated with suspicious imports and undefined methods, indicating potential concealment of malicious intent. However, no direct malicious activity such as network communication or data theft is evident. The current scores appropriately reflect high obfuscation but low confirmed malware. Further dynamic analysis is recommended if this code is part of a larger, executable environment.",
