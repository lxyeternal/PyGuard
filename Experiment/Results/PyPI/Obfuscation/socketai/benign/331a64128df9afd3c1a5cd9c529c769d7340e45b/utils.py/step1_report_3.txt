{
  "purpose": "The code appears to provide utility functions for date/time manipulation and a numeric comparison operation.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function parameters: 'zzOqoIYbYEueHfDXSBGBiMQgUJxiGAYL', 'KtXtqknbAeZkmHlfxyGYkseBqWVweXmn', 'brMLKBwPTKEyyvbtbyzcUHGiPfmmXxrV', 'MipQxLsRliRkuyATvGrsZqQSrHGtyOPA', 'WBjkCCfMdFcifxgUxebqVJOpMKIDhGce'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data to external sources, execute system commands, or perform network operations. No sinks indicating data leaks or malicious activity are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used directly within functions. The date/time functions create datetime objects. Numeric comparison uses parameters directly without external influence.",
  "anomalies": "The import statement from '__future__' includes an unusual and likely invalid import 'rnmCLoJpddTIgFHlSLFrbNgoSxdzjKGW'. The function names and variable names are obfuscated and do not provide semantic meaning, suggesting possible code obfuscation or autogenerated code. The import from 'datetime' includes an invalid member, which could cause runtime errors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three functions. The first attempts to generate a datetime object based on current time and an undefined method 'IrcZpPZjzhQPUPDnmscBnbYJeEhDzwzu' on a datetime object, which is invalid. The second function conditionally replaces a datetime component but is obfuscated. The third function compares the difference between two numbers against an absolute value, which is straightforward. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or system manipulation. The obfuscated names and invalid import suggest either obfuscated or nonsensical code, possibly for hiding true intent or just poor coding.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears obfuscated with nonsensical imports and function names, but does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. The invalid import will cause runtime errors, indicating poor quality or intentionally obfuscated code rather than malicious intent.",
