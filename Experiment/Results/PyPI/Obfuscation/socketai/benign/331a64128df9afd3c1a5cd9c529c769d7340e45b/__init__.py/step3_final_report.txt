  "purpose": "Manage version information and perform controlled dynamic import of submodules within the package.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from _version module; input attribute for dynamic import.",
  "sinks": "importlib.import_module call based on attribute name.",
  "flows": "Input attribute WvVELHfIvQJIaFkObwpCtWlsGMkjhTkn -> importlib.import_module(\".\" + attribute, __name__)",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; use of undefined variable 'name' in import statement (likely a bug or obfuscation).",
  "analysis": "The code employs obfuscated variable names and dynamic import patterns restricted to __all__, which limits risk but complicates analysis. The import of version info is straightforward. The function dynamically imports modules based on attribute names, which could be exploited if inputs are untrusted, but the code restricts to known names. The override of __dir__ constructs a list of globals minus imported modules, which is unconventional but not malicious. The undefined variable 'name' in the import call suggests obfuscation or a bug, raising suspicion. Overall, no evidence of malicious payloads, network activity, or data exfiltration is present. The obfuscation and dynamic import patterns are typical in modular code but can be misused. The main concern is potential misuse if inputs are manipulated, but restrictions to __all__ mitigate this risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a module management utility with obfuscation and controlled dynamic import. No active malicious activity is detected. The obfuscation and dynamic import patterns warrant caution, especially if inputs are untrusted. The undefined variable 'name' indicates possible obfuscation or a bug, which should be corrected but does not imply malicious intent. Overall, the code is low risk but should be reviewed for input validation and clarity.",
