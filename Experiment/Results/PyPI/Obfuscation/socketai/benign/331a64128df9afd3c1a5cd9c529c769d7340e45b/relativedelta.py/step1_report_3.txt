{
  "purpose": "The code appears to implement a custom datetime-like class with various arithmetic and property methods, primarily for manipulating date and time components, with no clear indication of malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include external datetime objects, timedelta objects, and numerical values passed to constructors and methods such as 'relativedelta' parameters, as well as property getters for internal attributes.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are class methods that perform arithmetic operations and property modifications, but they do not interact with external systems, networks, or sensitive data directly.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (datetimes, time components) into class attributes, through arithmetic methods (__add__, __sub__, __mul__, etc.), which modify internal state, then into output representations or new class instances.",
  "anomalies": "There is extensive obfuscated-like variable naming and some unusual behaviors such as the large class with many similar methods, property manipulations, and arithmetic that seem overly complex for typical datetime operations. Also, the function 'viUmRbHiWrvGqozXNEhhJWOPWoeXWxYG' returns an integer based on sign, used internally for calculations, but no direct malicious behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a complex custom implementation of a datetime-like class, with methods for arithmetic operations, property access, and representation. It performs extensive internal calculations for date and time components, with added warnings for non-integer absolute info. The class does not interact with external systems or perform file/network operations. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, or reverse shell behavior are detected. The code’s structure and naming are unconventional, but this appears to be a form of obfuscation or domain-specific code rather than malicious activity. The overall logic is consistent with date/time manipulation, with no signs of sabotage, backdoors, or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a highly obfuscated custom datetime manipulation class that performs internal date/time arithmetic without external system interaction. No malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage indicators are detected. The code's complexity and unconventional naming suggest obfuscation rather than malicious intent. Overall security risk is low.",
