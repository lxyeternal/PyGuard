  "raw_response": "{\n  \"purpose\": \"The code defines a complex datetime manipulation class, likely intended for precise time calculations and adjustments.\",\n  \"sources\": \"The code reads input data from parameters passed during object instantiation and method calls, including date/time objects, numerical values, and potentially external data via attributes and properties.\",\n  \"sinks\": \"Potential data sinks include attribute setters, property methods, and return values of methods that generate new datetime objects or manipulated numerical data. There are no evident direct data leaks or untrusted data outputs.\",\n  \"flows\": \"The data flows from input parameters to object attributes, through internal calculations, and then to method return values or attribute updates. Specifically, date/time objects are manipulated and combined with timedelta objects, and numerical calculations are performed with internal attributes.\",\n  \"anomalies\": \"No obvious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspiciously obfuscated logic. The class uses obscure variable names, but this appears to be a coding style rather than malicious obfuscation. The import of a potentially external module '.\\_common' is noted, but no malicious behavior is apparent from the usage.\",\n  \"analysis\": \"The code primarily handles datetime objects, performing calculations, adjustments, and generating new datetime instances with detailed control over date and time components. The class contains many methods for arithmetic, comparison, representation, and property management. It uses typical Python datetime and timedelta operations, with some checks for input types and value ranges. No external network operations, file I/O, or suspicious data handling mechanisms are present. The logic appears consistent with intended datetime manipulation, with no indicators of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command execution, or hidden backdoors.\",\n  \"conclusion\": \"The code is a sophisticated datetime manipulation class with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It appears to be a component for precise date/time calculations, possibly part of a larger time management or scheduling library. The use of cryptic variable names and import statements might be for code obfuscation or stylistic purposes, but do not indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.9,\n  \"obfuscated\": 0.2,\n  \"malware\": 0,\n  \"securityRisk\": 0.2\n}",
