{
  "purpose": "A heavily obfuscated datetime utility class performing internal date/time calculations, adjustments, and arithmetic operations.",
  "sources": "Constructor parameters, property getters/setters, internal methods involving datetime objects, numerical inputs, and class attributes.",
  "sinks": "No evidence of data leaks, network activity, or external system modifications; data remains within class attributes and calculations.",
  "flows": "Input parameters and internal attributes feed into date/time calculations, arithmetic operations, and property updates, with no external communication.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation of variable names and class structure; complex internal logic with no external side effects; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a complex, heavily obfuscated datetime-like class with internal arithmetic, date adjustments, and property management. No network calls, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are evident. The obfuscation appears to serve code concealment or intellectual property protection rather than malicious intent. The internal functions and calculations are consistent with date/time utilities, and no suspicious behaviors such as code injection or backdoors are detected. The benign function 'viUmRbHiWrvGqozXNEhhJWOPWoeXWxYG' simply returns the sign of a number, indicating no malicious activity. The code's complexity and obfuscation justify high obfuscation scores, but the absence of malicious indicators supports a malware score of 0. The overall security risk remains low, primarily due to the obfuscation but without any active malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated but benign datetime utility class. It performs complex date calculations without network activity or malicious payloads. The high obfuscation is likely for code protection rather than malicious purposes. The malware score is 0, and the overall security risk is low.",
