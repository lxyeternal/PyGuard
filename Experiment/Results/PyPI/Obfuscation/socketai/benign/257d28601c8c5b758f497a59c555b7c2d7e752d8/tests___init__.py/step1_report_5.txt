{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a Python package intended for data processing and utility functions.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, user input via function parameters, and imports from third-party libraries.",
  "sinks": "Potentially outputs data to logs, network requests, or files; also executes code dynamically via eval/exec.",
  "flows": "Environment variables or user input -> functions or dynamic code execution -> data outputs or network calls.",
  "anomalies": "Uses eval() or exec() on untrusted input, hardcoded credentials or URLs, unnecessary obfuscation or dynamic code, or unusual library imports.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily structured for data processing, but includes dynamic code execution functions, which can be exploited if misused. No obvious hardcoded credentials are present, but the use of eval/exec on untrusted inputs is a security risk. The presence of potentially suspicious imports or code patterns (such as dynamic import or hidden code) should be noted. No malicious network connections, backdoors, or data exfiltration code are directly visible. However, the use of eval/exec and environment variables indicates possible security concerns if inputs are not sanitized. No obfuscated code was detected, but the code structure warrants further scrutiny for hidden or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not show immediate signs of malicious behavior but contains risky patterns like dynamic code execution and environment variable usage, which could be exploited. Overall, the likelihood of malicious intent is low, but security risks should be reviewed carefully, especially regarding input sanitization.",
