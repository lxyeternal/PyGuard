  "purpose": "Static configuration-like assignments with obfuscated variable names, likely benign.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version string tuple and boolean; no external input or data flow.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks present; no external interactions or data processing.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static assignments only.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; static string resembling version constraint; no active logic.",
  "analysis": "The code contains two static variable assignments with obfuscated names, assigning a version string tuple and a boolean. There are no functions, input/output, external calls, or dynamic behaviors. The string 'pyramid >= 1.7' appears to be a version constraint but is statically assigned without context. The variables are not used further, indicating configuration or placeholder data. No malicious operations, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The obfuscation is superficial and does not imply malicious intent. Scores assigned by all reports (malware=0, low risk) are consistent with this static, benign code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of static, obfuscated variable assignments with no active malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation warrants cautious review in a larger context but does not indicate malicious intent here.",
