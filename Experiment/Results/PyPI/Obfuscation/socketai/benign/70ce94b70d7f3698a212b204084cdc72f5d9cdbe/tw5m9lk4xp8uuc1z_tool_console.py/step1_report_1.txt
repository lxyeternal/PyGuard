  "purpose": "This script generates barcode images in various formats based on user input data.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments for data, output filename, height, thickness, and quiet zone option.",
  "sinks": "File writing to save generated barcode images; potentially vulnerable if output filename is malicious or manipulated.",
  "flows": "Input arguments -> process data and generate barcode -> save to specified output file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. The script dynamically writes output based on user input without any obfuscation or suspicious code paths.",
  "analysis": "The script accepts user input via command-line arguments and uses the 'code128' library to generate barcode images. It performs format validation based on file extensions and writes the barcode either as SVG or image format. No external network calls, system command executions, or sensitive data handling are present. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The file operations are straightforward, and no secrets or credentials are hardcoded. The code performs expected operations for a barcode generator.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate barcode generator with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It relies on user-provided data and filenames and uses a third-party library for barcode creation. No suspicious behavior detected.",
