  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed in these import statements.",
  "flows": "No data flows; only module imports are present.",
  "anomalies": "Imported identifiers 'AwSeLSiPBtzlNxwErsiROOiMXcPkYizt' and 'yXSIkYgFQUgEYJvOtfwmegtoHjbXenrz' are highly obfuscated, which is unusual and could be suspicious. No other code present to evaluate further.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains import statements from local modules. The imported names are strongly obfuscated, which could be an attempt to hide malicious or malicious-looking functionality. There are no other code segments, data handling, or network activity to analyze. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent by itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code's purpose appears to be importing obfuscated entities, which could be benign or malicious. Without additional context or code, the suspicion is limited but warrants caution due to obfuscation.",
