  "purpose": "Import specific classes or functions from local modules 'console' and 'gui'.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules.",
  "sinks": "No evident untrusted data sinks or output operations; purely import statements.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; import statements do not establish data flows involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "Imported identifiers 'AwSeLSiPBtzlNxwErsiROOiMXcPkYizt' and 'yXSIkYgFQUgEYJvOtfwmegtoHjbXenrz' are highly obfuscated, nonsensical, and appear as random strings, suggesting potential obfuscation or malicious concealment.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two import statements importing specific members from local modules. The imported member names are highly obfuscated and appear as random character strings. Such obfuscated identifiers could be used to hide malicious functionality or backdoors. However, import statements alone are not inherently malicious; the intent depends on the contents of 'console' and 'gui' modules. The obfuscated names raise suspicion, but without additional code, the risk cannot be conclusively determined. No data flows, input sources, or malicious actions are evident here.",
  "conclusion": "The code's structure is minimal, and the only notable aspect is the use of highly obfuscated identifiers in import statements, which may indicate an attempt to conceal malicious code. However, with the current limited context, it cannot be definitively classified as malicious. Further review of the 'console' and 'gui' modules is recommended.",
