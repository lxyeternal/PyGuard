  "purpose": "Import heavily obfuscated classes/functions from local modules 'console' and 'gui' for use within the package.",
  "sources": "Local modules 'console' and 'gui' from which obfuscated identifiers are imported.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Import statements load modules; no runtime data flow or malicious payload execution observed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of heavily obfuscated identifiers that obscure the purpose of imported entities; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code contains two import statements importing obfuscated identifiers from local modules. No network activity, data leaks, or code execution are evident. The obfuscation raises suspicion but is not conclusive of malicious intent. The malware score is set low (0.2) consistent with the absence of direct malicious behavior. The obfuscation score is high (~0.8), reflecting the heavily obfuscated names. The security risk score is low (~0.3), indicating minimal immediate threat but warranting further review of the modules themselves. Overall, the code appears benign but suspicious due to obfuscation, requiring further inspection of the 'console' and 'gui' modules to rule out malicious content.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign in function but employs obfuscation that warrants caution. No evidence of malicious activity is present in these import statements. The scores assigned are appropriate; further review of the modules is recommended to confirm their safety.",
