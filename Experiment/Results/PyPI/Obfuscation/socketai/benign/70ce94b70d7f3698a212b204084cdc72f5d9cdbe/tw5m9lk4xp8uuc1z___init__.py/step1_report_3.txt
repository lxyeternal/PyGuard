  "purpose": "Import modules 'image' and 'svg' with obfuscated aliases, likely for further processing or usage within a larger application.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules '.image' and '.svg' reading module contents.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks or outputs identified in this fragment.",
  "flows": "Imported modules are assigned to variables 'image' and 'svg', but no further data flow is present.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated import alias names (xzxdEtEDbObWLUppwhjXzgtMNuNCGpUg, oZumlJMAxMGVWFcCmhyHYHYuVtIXpGip) suggests obfuscation or concealment, which is unusual in straightforward code and warrants scrutiny.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with obfuscated alias names. These alias names do not provide any meaningful context and are likely intentionally obscured. There are no data inputs, outputs, or processing steps present in this snippet. Such obfuscation could be benign but also raises suspicion of concealment of malicious intent, especially if used in conjunction with other malicious code. The minimal code provides no evidence of malicious behavior but the obfuscation technique alone warrants cautious review if part of a larger codebase.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be straightforward import statements with obfuscated alias names. While no malicious activity is explicitly evident, the obfuscation suggests an intent to conceal, which could be a security concern depending on the broader context. No immediate malicious behavior detected in this fragment.",
