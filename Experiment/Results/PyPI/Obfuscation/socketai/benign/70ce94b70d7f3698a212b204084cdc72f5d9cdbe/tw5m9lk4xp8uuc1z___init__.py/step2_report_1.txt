  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and the associated code snippets.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is minimal, consisting solely of import statements from local modules ('image' and 'svg') with highly obfuscated attribute names.\n- No data processing, network activity, or other operations are present.\n- The obfuscated names are suspicious, often associated with code obfuscation techniques used to conceal malicious intent.\n- The reports uniformly assign moderate confidence and obfuscation scores, with malware scores generally low but not zero.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n\n- **Obfuscation of imported attribute names:** All reports correctly identify that the attribute names are obfuscated or randomly generated, which is unusual and warrants caution.\n- **Lack of further code or context:** The snippets do not show any malicious activity, data handling, or network interactions.\n\n### Potential errors or flaws in the reports:\n\n- **Assumption of malicious intent based solely on obfuscation:** While obfuscation can be suspicious, it is not inherently malicious. The reports lean towards suspicion but do not provide evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Lack of analysis of the imported modules:** The reports do not consider that the modules themselves might be benign or malicious; the focus is solely on the import statements.\n- **Scores assigned are somewhat arbitrary:** The malware scores are low (0.2), which seems reasonable given the evidence, but the justification for these specific scores could be more detailed.\n\n---\n\n### Score review and suggestions:\n\n- **Malware score:** Given the minimal code and lack of malicious activity, a malware score of around 0.2–0.3 seems appropriate. The current scores (mostly 0.2) are reasonable.\n- **Obfuscated score:** High obfuscation scores (0.7–0.8) are justified due to the obfuscated attribute names.\n- **Risk score:** Since no malicious activity is evident, a low to moderate risk score (0.2–0.3) is justified. The current scores align with this.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n- If the imported modules are from untrusted sources or contain malicious code, the risk could be higher, but based solely on these snippets, the current scores are appropriate.\n- The reports could improve by emphasizing that obfuscation alone does not confirm malicious intent but warrants further review.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** ~0.2  \n**Obfuscated score:** ~0.8  \n**Risk score:** ~0.2–0.3\n\nThese reflect the suspicion raised by obfuscation but acknowledge the absence of concrete malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n- The code snippets are minimal and do not show malicious behavior.\n- Obfuscation is present and warrants caution but is not definitive proof of malicious intent.\n- The current scoring is reasonable, but further investigation into the actual modules ('image' and 'svg') is recommended.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe overall security risk appears low to moderate, primarily due to obfuscation. No evidence suggests active malicious behavior at this stage.",
