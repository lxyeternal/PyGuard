{
  "purpose": "Import specific components from local modules 'image' and 'svg', likely for further processing or rendering.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules '.image' and '.svg'. No input reading from user, network, or environment variables.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; imports are static references.",
  "anomalies": "Imports are from local modules with highly obfuscated or nonsensical alias names, which could be an obfuscation tactic. No other unusual code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two components from relative modules, assigning them obscure alias names. There are no functions, no data processing, no network activity, and no visible malicious behavior. The use of obscure alias names might be an attempt to hide functionality, but on its own, it does not indicate malicious intent. The code is minimal and does not perform any operations beyond importing modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with obfuscated alias names. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident from this snippet. The obfuscation may be suspicious but not inherently malicious.",
