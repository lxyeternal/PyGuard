  "purpose": "Import obfuscated attributes from local modules 'image' and 'svg' for use elsewhere in the application.",
  "sources": "Import statements from '.image' and '.svg' modules, accessing attributes with obfuscated names.",
  "sinks": "No data flows, network calls, or data processing observed; potential concern if imported modules contain malicious code.",
  "flows": "Import statements load obfuscated attributes; no further data flow or execution shown.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated attribute names, minimal code, no context or additional logic, which is suspicious but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with obfuscated attribute names, which is unusual and warrants caution. No malicious activity, data leaks, or network interactions are evident. The obfuscation could be used to conceal malicious code, but without further context, it remains speculative. The scores assigned in reports (malware ~0.2, obfuscated ~0.8, risk ~0.3) are appropriate given the evidence. The minimal code and lack of behavior suggest low to moderate risk, primarily flagged due to obfuscation. Further review of the actual modules is recommended to determine if obfuscation is benign or malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is minimal and only shows obfuscated import statements, which raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. The current scores are reasonable, reflecting the cautious stance due to obfuscation. No active malicious behavior is evident, but further investigation into the imported modules is advised.",
