{
  "purpose": "Import specific classes or functions from local modules 'image' and 'svg' for further use in the program.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: '.image' and '.svg'.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks identified; no network, file, or external system interactions are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as the code only imports modules and does not process data or execute data flows.",
  "anomalies": "The imported names 'xzxdEtEDbObWLUppwhjXzgtMNuNCGpUg' and 'oZumlJMAxMGVWFcCmhyHYHYuVtIXpGip' appear as obfuscated or randomly generated identifiers, which could suggest intentional obfuscation. The use of relative imports with such unusual attribute names is atypical and suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs simple import statements from local modules, assigning obfuscated names to imported classes or functions. The naming pattern suggests code obfuscation or concealment, which is often used to hide malicious intent. There are no other operations, data processing, or network interactions shown. The purpose seems to be to load specific components, but the obfuscated names warrant caution. No direct malicious behavior can be confirmed from these lines alone, but the obfuscation raises suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal and primarily consists of import statements with obfuscated attribute names, which may indicate an attempt to hide malicious intent. No malicious actions are evident in this snippet, but the obfuscation and unusual naming merit further review of the complete package.",
