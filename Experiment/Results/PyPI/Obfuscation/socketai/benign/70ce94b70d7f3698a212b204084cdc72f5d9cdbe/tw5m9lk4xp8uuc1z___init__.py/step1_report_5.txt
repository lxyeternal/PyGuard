{
  "purpose": "The code imports modules related to image and SVG processing, likely as part of a larger application or library.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules: .image and .svg, which may contain data or functions for image and SVG handling.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or untrusted data handling observed in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks within this snippet; the code only performs module imports.",
  "anomalies": "Imported names 'xzxdEtEDbObWLUppwhjXzgtMNuNCGpUg' and 'oZumlJMAxMGVWFcCmhyHYHYuVtIXpGip' are obfuscated, suggesting intentional concealment of functionality. No other code present to clarify their purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with obfuscated module attribute names. These names do not provide insight into their purpose, raising suspicion about concealment. No additional logic, data handling, or network activity is visible. Since the code is minimal, the potential for malicious behavior is mostly based on obfuscation rather than explicit malicious actions. Without access to the modules themselves, the risk cannot be fully determined, but the obfuscation indicates a need for further review.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal and primarily consists of obfuscated import statements. This obfuscation can be a tactic to hide malicious intent, but there is no direct evidence of malicious activity within this snippet alone. The overall security risk is low to moderate, pending further review of the imported modules.",
