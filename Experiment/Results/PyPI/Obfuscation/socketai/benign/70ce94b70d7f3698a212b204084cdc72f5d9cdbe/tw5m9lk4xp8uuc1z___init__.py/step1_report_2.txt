{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific functions or classes from local modules 'image' and 'svg', likely for image processing or SVG manipulation.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules within the package ('image' and 'svg'), using obfuscated attribute names.",
  "sinks": "None directly observed; no functions or data handling beyond imports are shown.",
  "flows": "No data flow is apparent within this snippet; only static imports are present.",
  "anomalies": "Imports use highly obfuscated attribute names, which may be an attempt to hide functionality. No other suspicious activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains shebang and import statements. The attribute names imported are intentionally obfuscated, which could be a method to conceal malicious intent. However, no actual code execution, data handling, or network activity is present in this snippet. The structure and content do not reveal malicious behavior by themselves but warrant caution due to obfuscated identifiers.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be straightforward import statements with obfuscated attribute names. While obfuscation can be benign, it could also indicate an attempt to hide malicious behavior. No malicious actions or security risks are evident in this fragment alone.",
