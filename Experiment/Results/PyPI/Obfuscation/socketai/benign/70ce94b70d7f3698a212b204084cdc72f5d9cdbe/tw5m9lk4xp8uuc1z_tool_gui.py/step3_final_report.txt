  "purpose": "GUI application for generating, displaying, and saving Code128 barcodes based on user input.",
  "sources": "User input fields, file dialog for saving, external modules 'code128' and 'ModifiedMixin'.",
  "sinks": "File save operation, image display on canvas.",
  "flows": "User inputs text -> barcode image generated via 'code128' -> image displayed on canvas -> user saves image through file dialog.",
  "anomalies": "Heavily obfuscated variable and class names, import of external 'code128' module and local 'ModifiedMixin' with no source code provided.",
  "analysis": "The code is a GUI barcode generator that relies on external modules and obfuscated identifiers. No network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications are present. The obfuscation may serve concealment but does not indicate malicious intent. The external 'code128' module's origin is unknown, which warrants caution, but within this code fragment, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The script functions as a legitimate barcode generator with obfuscation but no malicious activity detected. The high obfuscation score reflects variable name concealment, but the malware score remains at zero due to lack of malicious indicators. The overall security risk is low. External dependencies should be verified for safety, but based on this code, it appears safe.",
