  "conclusion": "The script functions as a legitimate barcode generator with obfuscation but no malicious activity detected. The high obfuscation score reflects variable name concealment, but the malware score remains at zero due to lack of malicious indicators. The overall security risk is low. External dependencies should be verified for safety, but based on this code, it appears safe."
