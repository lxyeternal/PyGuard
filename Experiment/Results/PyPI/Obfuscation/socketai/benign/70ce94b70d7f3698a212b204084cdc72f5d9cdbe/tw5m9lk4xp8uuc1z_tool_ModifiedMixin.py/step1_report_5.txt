  "purpose": "A Tkinter-based text widget subclass that handles modified events and prints a message on a specific event.",
  "sources": "Reading widget state and configuration via self.tk.call, event parameters",
  "sinks": "Calling self.tk.call to modify widget state, printing to stdout",
  "flows": "Modified event triggers HylFzFwgGOmvWkLjggPcqSnnFXciLmgQ -> ICDlCdojJrklWEcaJKAqPIVzJWGBEaaJ -> print statement",
  "anomalies": "Complex, obfuscated method names; use of tkinter call with 'edit modified 0'; no direct malicious API usage",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with obfuscated method names managing a Tkinter Text widget's 'modified' flag. The methods handle events and reset the modified flag securely. The main class inherits from Text and binds the event handlers. The overridden methods do not contain malicious logic; they perform standard widget event handling. No suspicious network activity, data leakage, or malicious payloads are evident. The code appears to be a customized widget setup with obfuscated naming but no malicious behavior or malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is an obfuscated, custom Tkinter widget handler that manages 'modified' events securely. There are no signs of malicious activity, malware, or security risks. The obfuscation seems to serve to hide the straightforward event handling logic rather than conceal malicious intent.",
