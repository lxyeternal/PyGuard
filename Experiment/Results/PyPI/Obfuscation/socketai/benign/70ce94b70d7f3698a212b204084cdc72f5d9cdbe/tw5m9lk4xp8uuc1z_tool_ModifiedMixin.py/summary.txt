  "conclusion": "The code is obfuscated but primarily performs standard Tkinter widget state management without evidence of malicious activity. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware activity is absent. Overall security risk is low, with the main concern being obfuscation that could conceal malicious intent, which is not supported by current evidence."
