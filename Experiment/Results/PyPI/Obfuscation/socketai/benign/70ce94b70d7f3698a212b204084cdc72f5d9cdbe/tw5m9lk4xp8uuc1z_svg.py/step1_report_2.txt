{
  "purpose": "The code generates an SVG image with a series of alternating white and colored rectangles based on input data, likely for visual representation such as a barcode or pattern.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the function parameter 'data', which is processed by the imported '_format' function. No other external inputs are used.",
  "sinks": "The code constructs an SVG XML string and returns it; the only output is a generated SVG image. No untrusted data is sent to external systems or network.",
  "flows": "Input 'data' → '_format' function → processed list → iteration over list to create SVG rectangles → output SVG string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code constructs observed. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a formatting function and uses it to process input data into a sequence. It then calculates total width, optionally adds quiet zone margins, and creates an SVG image with alternating colored rectangles. The SVG is built as a string with no external side effects or network activity. The code appears to be straightforward and focused solely on SVG generation without any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign SVG generator for visual data representation. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. No evidence of malware or malicious intent is present.",
