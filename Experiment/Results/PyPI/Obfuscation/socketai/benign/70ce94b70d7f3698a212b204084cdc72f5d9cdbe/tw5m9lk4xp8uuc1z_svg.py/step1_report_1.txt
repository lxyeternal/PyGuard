  "purpose": "Generate an SVG barcode or graphic representation from input data, formatted as XML.",
  "sources": "The data parameter passed to the function oZumlJMAxMGVWFcCmhyHYHYuVtIXpGip, and the imported _format function.",
  "sinks": "The output string that contains SVG XML code; potential data leak if data contains sensitive information.",
  "flows": "Input data -> _format(data, thickness) -> Loop over formatted data -> Generate SVG rectangles -> Return SVG string.",
  "anomalies": "The function name and variable names are obfuscated, which can be suspicious but not necessarily malicious. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. No network operations or file I/O are present. The _format function is imported but its implementation is not shown, which could potentially contain malicious code, but cannot be evaluated here.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily transforms input data into a list of formatted rectangles to generate an SVG image. It sums the formatted data, adjusts for quiet zones, and constructs an SVG document string with rectangles, alternating fill patterns. The obfuscated naming could indicate an attempt to hide purpose, but the code itself is straightforward SVG generation. No malicious network activity, data theft, or malicious code patterns are detected. The import of an external _format function remains a potential concern if maliciously crafted, but based solely on this code snippet, it is not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to generate an SVG graphic from input data, with no evident malicious behavior or security risks within this snippet. The obfuscation and reliance on an external format function are noted but do not constitute malicious activity. Overall, the code seems benign.",
