  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign SVG generator with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage within this snippet. The primary concern is the external _format function, which should be reviewed separately. Malware score is 0, security risk is low (~0.2), obfuscation is moderate (~0.6)."
