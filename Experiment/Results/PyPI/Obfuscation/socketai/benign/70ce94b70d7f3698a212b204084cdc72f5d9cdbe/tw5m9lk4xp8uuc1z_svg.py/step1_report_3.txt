{
  "purpose": "The code appears to generate an SVG image based on input data, likely visualizing QR code or similar 2D barcode data.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the parameter 'data' and processes it using the imported '_format' function.",
  "sinks": "The code generates an SVG string as output; no direct sinks for untrusted data are evident except for output generation.",
  "flows": "Input data -> '_format' processing -> SVG element creation -> output string",
  "anomalies": "The code contains obfuscated variable and function names, but no evidence of malicious code such as network activity, file access, or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a formatting function and uses it to process input data. It calculates total width and creates an SVG image with alternating colored rectangles, possibly for visualizing barcode-like data. The SVG is constructed via string formatting and concatenation. No hardcoded credentials, network calls, or suspicious behavior are present. The obfuscated variable names suggest an attempt to hide intent, but no malicious operations are evident. The function solely generates SVG output based on processed input data.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign SVG generator, likely for visualizing barcode or QR code data. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
