  "purpose": "Generates an SVG barcode or pattern visualization based on input data processed by an external _format function.",
  "sources": "Input data passed to _format function, which processes data for SVG generation.",
  "sinks": "SVG string output; no untrusted data sinks or network/file operations present.",
  "flows": "Input data -> _format processing -> SVG rectangle elements -> SVG output string.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names; reliance on external _format function with unknown implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs an SVG image with alternating rectangles, likely for barcode or pattern visualization. It obfuscates variable names but performs straightforward SVG generation without network or file I/O. The external _format function could be malicious if crafted maliciously, but no evidence of malicious behavior exists within this snippet. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or code injection. Obfuscation is present but not inherently malicious. The overall logic is benign, and no malicious activity such as data exfiltration or system modification is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign SVG generator with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage within this snippet. The primary concern is the external _format function, which should be reviewed separately. Malware score is 0, security risk is low (~0.2), obfuscation is moderate (~0.6).",
