{
  "purpose": "The code imports a class or function from the 'code128.tool' module and immediately executes it.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'code128.tool', instantiation or function call of 'AwSeLSiPBtzlNxwErsiROOiMXcPkYizt()'.",
  "sinks": "The instantiation or execution of 'AwSeLSiPBtzlNxwErsiROOiMXcPkYizt()' could potentially perform malicious actions if the imported object executes untrusted code or performs harmful operations.",
  "flows": "Import from 'code128.tool' → execution of 'AwSeLSiPBtzlNxwErsiROOiMXcPkYizt()'.",
  "anomalies": "The class/function name 'AwSeLSiPBtzlNxwErsiROOiMXcPkYizt' appears obfuscated or randomly generated, which could be suspicious. The code imports from a third-party or local module with no visible validation or context.",
  "analysis": "The code imports an obfuscated class or function and executes it immediately. The name appears deliberately obfuscated, which is often used to hide malicious intent or payloads. The imported object may perform operations upon instantiation or invocation, potentially including malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system modification, or network communication. There are no other security checks, validations, or visible safeguards.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious due to the obfuscated import and immediate execution without context or validation. It could potentially execute malicious payloads hidden within the imported object, indicating a high risk of malicious behavior.",
