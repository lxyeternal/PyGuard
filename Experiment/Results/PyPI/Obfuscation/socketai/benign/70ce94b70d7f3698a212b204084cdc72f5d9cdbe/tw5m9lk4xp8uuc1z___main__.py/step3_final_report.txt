  "purpose": "Import and execute an obfuscated class/function from 'code128.tool', potentially executing malicious code.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'code128.tool' for 'AwSeLSiPBtzlNxwErsiROOiMXcPkYizt'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'AwSeLSiPBtzlNxwErsiROOiMXcPkYizt()' which may perform harmful actions upon instantiation.",
  "flows": "Import from 'code128.tool' → instantiation/execution of 'AwSeLSiPBtzlNxwErsiROOiMXcPkYizt()'.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated class/function name, immediate execution without validation, import from an obscure module.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class or function with an obfuscated name from 'code128.tool' and executes it immediately. The obfuscation and pattern of immediate execution are common in malicious payloads designed to conceal intent. Without further context or inspection of the imported object, the behavior cannot be confirmed, but the pattern is suspicious. The high obfuscation score and immediate execution suggest potential malicious intent, warranting caution and further investigation.",
  "conclusion": "The code pattern is highly suspicious due to obfuscation and immediate execution, indicating a high likelihood of malicious behavior. Scores should be adjusted upward to reflect this risk, and further analysis of the imported module is recommended.",
