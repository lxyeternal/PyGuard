  "purpose": "Define a version string for a Python package or module",
  "sources": "Assignment of a version string to the variable kmbtRgjTKtWdwVyJZAHNoCIYWiboqXWs and VERSION",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output occurs",
  "flows": "Assignment flow from string to variables; no data flow from external sources",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable name (kmbtRgjTKtWdwVyJZAHNoCIYWiboqXWs), which appears obfuscated or randomly generated; no other anomalies",
  "analysis": "The code assigns the string '0.5.1' to two variables with a long, seemingly random name and a variable named VERSION. No external input, data processing, or malicious constructs are present. The variable name appears obfuscated, which is uncommon but not inherently malicious. Overall, this is typical version assignment code with no suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code simply assigns a version string to two variables, one with an obfuscated name. There is no malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risk evident from this snippet.",
