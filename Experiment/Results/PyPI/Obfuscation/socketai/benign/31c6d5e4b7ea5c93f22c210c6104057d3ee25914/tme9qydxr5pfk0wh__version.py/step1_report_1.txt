  "flows": "Assignment of the version string to variables",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable name 'kmbtRgjTKtWdwVyJZAHNoCIYWiboqXWs', which appears random or obfuscated",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a string '0.5.1' to two variables, one with a seemingly random or obfuscated name and another named 'VERSION'. There are no other operations, no input/output, no external calls, or suspicious code patterns. The random variable name may suggest obfuscation, but it is merely a variable assignment with no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to only define a version string with an unusual variable name, likely for obfuscation or code organization purposes. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or data leaks present.",
