  "purpose": "Define a version string for the package or module.",
  "sources": "Assignment statement setting 'kmbtRgjTKtWdwVyJZAHNoCIYWiboqXWs' and 'VERSION' to '0.5.1'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "None, only variable assignment occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable name 'kmbtRgjTKtWdwVyJZAHNoCIYWiboqXWs', which appears to be a random string, but is used solely for assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns the string '0.5.1' to two variables, one with a seemingly random name and one with a clear 'VERSION' label. No input, output, or external system interactions are present. No signs of malicious intent, data leakage, or suspicious behavior are detected. The only unusual aspect is the variable name, which appears obfuscated or randomly generated but has no malicious implications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward version assignment with an atypical variable name. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
