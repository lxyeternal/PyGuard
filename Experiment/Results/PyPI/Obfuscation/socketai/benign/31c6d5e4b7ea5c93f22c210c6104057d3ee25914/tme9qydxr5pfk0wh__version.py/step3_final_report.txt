  "purpose": "Define the package version with an obfuscated variable name",
  "sources": "Assignment of version string to variables",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present",
  "flows": "Static assignment; no data flow from external sources",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable name, but no malicious code or external interactions",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string '0.5.1' to two variables, one with a random-looking name and one named VERSION. No input/output, external calls, or dynamic code execution are present. The variable name appears obfuscated but is used solely for static assignment. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The obfuscation is superficial and does not imply malicious intent. Scores across reports are consistent with this benign interpretation, with malware scores at 0 and low security risk scores. The obfuscation score varies but is justified by the variable name's appearance; overall, the code is straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version assignment with an obfuscated variable name, showing no malicious activity or security risks. The variable name's obfuscation is superficial and does not indicate malicious intent. The existing scores are appropriate; no adjustments are necessary.",
