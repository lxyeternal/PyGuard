  "anomalies": "Unusual variable name 'kmbtRgjTKtWdwVyJZAHNoCIYWiboqXWs' which appears random and obfuscated; no clear purpose or context provided",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a string '0.5.1' to a variable named 'VERSION' and another variable with a random-looking name. The random variable name could be an obfuscated attempt to hide the true intent, but as it only involves static string assignment, it does not indicate malicious activity. There are no inputs, outputs, or external interactions. The code is minimal and straightforward but the variable name is suspiciously obfuscated. No malicious functions, data leaks, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to simply set a version string with an obfuscated variable name. No malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks are evident. The obfuscation may be for internal reasons but does not indicate malicious intent.",
