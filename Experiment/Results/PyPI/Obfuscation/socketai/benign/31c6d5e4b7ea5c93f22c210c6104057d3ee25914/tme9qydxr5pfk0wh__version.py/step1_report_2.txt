  "purpose": "Define a version string for the package or module.",
  "sources": "Assignment statement setting a string value to variables",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "Simple variable assignment, no data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable name 'kmbtRgjTKtWdwVyJZAHNoCIYWiboqXWs' which appears random or obfuscated, but no malicious actions are evident",
  "analysis": "The code assigns the string '0.5.1' to two variables: 'VERSION' and an obfuscated-looking variable. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code execution, or malicious logic. The variable name might suggest obfuscation, but it only appears as an arbitrary, nonsensical identifier. The assignment itself is benign and typical for defining version info. No external input or output, no logic, no suspicious functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version assignment with an unusual variable name. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
