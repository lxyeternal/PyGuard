  "purpose": "To set up and install a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The import statement '__import__('setuptools')' which loads the setuptools module.",
  "sinks": "The 'setup()' function, which typically processes package metadata and installation procedures.",
  "flows": "Import of setuptools -> execution of setup() function, which may handle untrusted data if supplied via arguments (not present here).",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior; the code is minimal and standard for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'setuptools' module dynamically and immediately calls its 'setup()' function with default parameters. It does not contain any user input, external data, or arguments that could introduce vulnerabilities or malicious behavior. The code appears to be a typical setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious intent or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard minimal setup script used for Python package installation. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks.",
