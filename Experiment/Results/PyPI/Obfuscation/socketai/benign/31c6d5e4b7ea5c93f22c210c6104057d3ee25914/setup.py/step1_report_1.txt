{
  "purpose": "To invoke the setup function from the setuptools package, typically used for packaging and distribution of Python projects.",
  "sources": "__import__('setuptools')",
  "sinks": "setup() function call",
  "flows": "Import setuptools module -> Call setup()",
  "anomalies": "Use of __import__ with a string argument; no parameters or arguments passed to setup() which may limit functionality but does not indicate malicious activity",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports the 'setuptools' module using __import__() and immediately calls its setup() function with no arguments. This pattern is common in minimal setup scripts for Python packages. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code is straightforward and standard for package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a minimal and legitimate setup script for a Python package, involving no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
