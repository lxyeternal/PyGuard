{
  "purpose": "The code attempts to import a specific variable from a local module and provides a fallback warning if the import fails. It also defines a function that returns configuration data for a JupyterLab extension.",
  "sources": "The import statement from ._version import kmbtRgjTKtWdwVyJZAHNoCIYWiboqXWs",
  "sinks": "The returned data in GVkmwDKPYsEShOTjsgenrAjHmKpyCtJn(), which outputs configuration details",
  "flows": "Import statement → fallback warning setting 'kmbtRgjTKtWdwVyJZAHNoCIYWiboqXWs' to 'dev' → function returning static configuration data",
  "anomalies": "Use of a highly obfuscated variable name for import, fallback to 'dev' without clear context, no evident user input or external data processing, no suspicious dynamic code execution",
  "analysis": "The code's primary function is to import a version identifier or token from a local module. If the import fails, it issues a warning and sets a default value. The function simply returns static configuration data related to a JupyterLab extension. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The obfuscated variable name could be a minor anomaly but does not inherently suggest malicious intent. Overall, the code appears to be a standard setup or configuration snippet with no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward configuration snippet that handles import errors gracefully and returns static extension configuration data. There is no evidence of malicious activity, suspicious code, or malware in this fragment.",
