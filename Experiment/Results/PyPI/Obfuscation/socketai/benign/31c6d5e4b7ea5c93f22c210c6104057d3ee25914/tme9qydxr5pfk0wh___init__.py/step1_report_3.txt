  "purpose": "Attempt to import a version identifier from a local module, or fallback to a default value, and define a function returning extension information.",
  "sources": "Import statement from ._version and fallback assignment to 'kmbtRgjTKtWdwVyJZAHNoCIYWiboqXWs'.",
  "sinks": "The fallback assignment assigns a string to a variable; no data leakage or external communication is present.",
  "flows": "Import failure triggers a warning and a default assignment; the function simply returns static data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of an obfuscated variable name 'kmbtRgjTKtWdwVyJZAHNoCIYWiboqXWs' suggests an attempt to conceal intent or code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import a specific version identifier. If the import fails, it issues a warning and assigns a default string to the variable. The function defined returns static data about a JupyterLab extension. The variable naming and obfuscated import path may be intended to conceal behavior, but there is no evidence of malicious activities such as data exfiltration, code injection, or system compromise. The code appears to serve a benign purpose related to extension management. No suspicious network activity, credential handling, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily a benign fallback mechanism for version detection and extension info. The obfuscated variable name could be a minor attempt at concealment but does not indicate malicious intent. No malware or security risks are detected.",
