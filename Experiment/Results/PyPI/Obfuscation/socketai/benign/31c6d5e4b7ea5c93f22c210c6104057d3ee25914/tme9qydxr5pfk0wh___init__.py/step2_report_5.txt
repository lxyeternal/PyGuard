  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code imports a variable from a local module, warns if it fails, and defines a function returning static extension data. No malicious activity is indicated.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.1, obfuscated=0.2, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** The obfuscated variable name is noted but not suspicious on its own. The overall benign nature aligns with the low scores. The high confidence is justified.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with obfuscated variable name, no malicious activity, and benign static data.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0.7, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** The high obfuscation score is consistent. No issues detected.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Obfuscated variable, fallback to 'dev', no malicious activity, benign extension info.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.2, obfuscated=0.6, confidence=0.8\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher risk due to obfuscation but still no evidence of malicious behavior. The scores seem reasonable.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Obfuscated variable, fallback to 'dev', no malicious activity, benign purpose.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.2, obfuscated=0.4, confidence=0.8\n- **Assessment:** The obfuscation score is moderate; the low malware score is appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Similar pattern, with obfuscated variable, benign static configuration.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0.4, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the other reports.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Observations:\n- **Presence of issues:** All reports agree that the code is benign, with no malicious activity, network communication, or code injection.\n- **Obfuscation:** The variable name is obfuscated in all reports, but this alone does not imply malicious intent. It could be for version control or code generation.\n- **Malware scores:** All are zero, which is appropriate given the analysis.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low, reflecting the benign nature.\n- **Confidence levels:** High, indicating strong agreement among reports.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The obfuscation scores could be slightly lowered if we consider obfuscation as a minor concern rather than suspicion, but given the context, their current levels are reasonable.\n- No changes are necessary for the scores; they align well with the analysis.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** approximately 0.4–0.7 (average around 0.5)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (average around 0.15)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears to be a standard configuration snippet with obfuscated variable names, likely for internal versioning or code generation purposes. No malicious activity or security risks are evident.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep malware score at 0, obfuscated around 0.5, and risk around 0.15.",
