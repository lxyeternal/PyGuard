{
  "purpose": "Attempt to import a version variable from a local module; fallback to 'dev' if import fails; provide static extension configuration data.",
  "sources": "Import statement from ._version module, fallback assignment, static return data in function",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external communication",
  "flows": "Import attempt → fallback assignment → function returning static data",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable name 'kmbtRgjTKtWdwVyJZAHNoCIYWiboqXWs', which may indicate concealment or obfuscation but no malicious activity",
  "analysis": "The code performs a benign import with a fallback warning and returns static configuration data. The variable name is obfuscated but does not demonstrate malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection. The import failure fallback to 'dev' is standard. No suspicious flows or external interactions are present. The obfuscated variable name raises suspicion but is not evidence of malicious intent in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration snippet with obfuscated variable naming, likely for internal versioning or obfuscation purposes. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security risks.",
