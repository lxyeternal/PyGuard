{
  "purpose": "The code attempts to import a version identifier from a local module and defines a function returning installation metadata for a JupyterLab extension.",
  "sources": "Import statement from ._version and the module attribute kmbtRgjTKtWdwVyJZAHNoCIYWiboqXWs",
  "sinks": "None explicitly, but the function returns extension installation info, which is benign",
  "flows": "Import source -> fallback assignment -> function returning static data",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable name (kmbtRgjTKtWdwVyJZAHNoCIYWiboqXWs), minimal error handling, no user input or external data processing, no suspicious network activity or code execution",
  "analysis": "The code begins by attempting to import a version identifier from a local module, with a fallback warning if the import fails. The fallback assigns a string 'dev' to the variable. The function defined simply returns static extension metadata. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The variable naming appears obfuscated, possibly for non-standard reasons, but does not imply malicious intent. The overall structure is simple and consistent with normal package or extension setup code.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears benign, performing standard import handling and returning static configuration data. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
