  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, network/file/system calls, input data, and code execution points.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission, file writes, environment variable access, and system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input sources (e.g., environment variables) to sinks (e.g., network, files), potentially via dynamic code execution or data handling functions.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code, missing code snippets, suspicion of obfuscation (e.g., dynamic execution, obscure variables), but no concrete malicious patterns identified.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is missing or not available for review. Reports acknowledge the absence or general description of code, with some suspicion of obfuscation in Report 1. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious network activity are observed. The scores reflect low malware likelihood (0), moderate suspicion of obfuscation (0.4-0.5), and low security risk (0.2-0.3). Confidence levels are high when no code is present and moderate when suspicion exists. Overall, the analysis indicates no evidence of malicious intent, with cautious scoring due to missing or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign or unreviewed due to absence; no malicious activity or sabotage detected. Scores are consistent with the evidence, indicating low risk and malware likelihood. Continued monitoring or review is recommended if code becomes available.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
