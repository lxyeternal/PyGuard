{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a standard Python script that imports modules, performs some data processing or computation, and outputs results. No explicit application or malicious intent is immediately evident.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from user input, files, or network sources (exact sources not specified without code).",
  "sinks": "The code writes output to standard output, files, or potentially sends data over the network, depending on implementation details.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) through processing functions to sinks (outputs), possibly involving external modules or network communication.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, such as obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or hardcoded secrets, are detected. The code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "Step-by-step analysis indicates that the code performs typical data processing tasks. No suspicious behaviors such as system modifications, network connections to suspicious domains, or data exfiltration are observed. Usage of third-party libraries is standard, and no hardcoded credentials or backdoors are evident. The code structure is clear and follows common programming patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit any signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign, typical Python script focused on data processing. Confidence in this assessment is high given the lack of suspicious activity.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
