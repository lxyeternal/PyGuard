{
  "purpose": "The code consists of API interface definitions, constants, regex patterns for filenames, and method signatures related to a trading platform. It is intended for establishing connections, data exchange, registration, and handling trading operations.",
  "sources": "String literals, regex patterns, constants, method parameters, callback functions, network addresses, and configuration data.",
  "sinks": "Network communication functions, connection handling, data transmission, and callback invocations.",
  "flows": "Input data such as network addresses, user info, and configuration parameters flow into connection setup, registration, heartbeat, and data exchange functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present. Regex patterns and method signatures are standard and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily API interface definitions, constants, and documentation for a trading system. No executable malicious logic, payloads, or backdoors are identified. The network functions and callback mechanisms are typical for such APIs. No signs of data leakage, privilege escalation, or sabotage are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk~0.1-0.2) are justified given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate API interface for a trading platform with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or supply chain compromise. The low risk scores are appropriate and reflect a very low security concern.",
