  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, reading README.md and version info, with obfuscated variable names.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md; executes code from '__version__.py' via exec()",
  "sinks": "exec() on version file, potential for executing malicious code if file is compromised",
  "flows": "Reads README.md; conditionally executes '__version__.py' content with exec()",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; use of exec() on local version file",
  "analysis": "The script functions as a typical setup script but employs obfuscation and dynamic code execution via exec(). The use of exec() on a local version file introduces a supply chain security risk, especially if the file can be tampered with. Obfuscation of variable names raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. No network activity or malicious payloads are present. The pattern of executing code during setup is common but risky if the source is untrusted.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscation and a notable security concern due to exec() usage. While no malicious payloads are evident, the pattern of executing a version file dynamically could be exploited if the file is compromised. Obfuscation further raises suspicion but is not definitive of malicious intent. Overall, the security risk is moderate, primarily because of the exec() pattern, and the code should be reviewed for safer version handling.",
