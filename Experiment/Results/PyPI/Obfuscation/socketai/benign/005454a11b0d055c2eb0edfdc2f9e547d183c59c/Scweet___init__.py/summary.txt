  "conclusion": "The code shows obfuscation and dynamic execution patterns that raise moderate concern but lacks definitive malicious actions. The suspicion justifies a malware score of 0.3, an obfuscation score of 0.7, and a security risk score of 0.4. The overall assessment suggests cautious monitoring but no immediate threat. Scores are consistent with the evidence."
