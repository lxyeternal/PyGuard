  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Potential input points include environment variables, external data sources, and dynamic code execution functions like eval() or exec().",
  "sinks": "External network communication, file writing, or system modifications that could leak data or harm the system.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or user input through processing functions to sinks like network sockets or file systems.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation (e.g., encoded strings, dynamic code execution), ambiguous control flow, or suspicious patterns like hardcoded credentials or hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, with ambiguous control flow suggesting potential malicious intent. No concrete malicious payloads are confirmed, but suspicion remains due to obfuscation techniques. External communication points are present but benign. The overall structure indicates moderate risk with some suspicion of sabotage or privacy violations.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows obfuscation and dynamic execution patterns that raise moderate concern but lacks definitive malicious actions. The suspicion justifies a malware score of 0.3, an obfuscation score of 0.7, and a security risk score of 0.4. The overall assessment suggests cautious monitoring but no immediate threat. Scores are consistent with the evidence.",
