  "conclusion": "The script functions as a Twitter scraper with significant obfuscation and coding issues. There is no explicit evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The high obfuscation score is justified, but overall, the code's purpose is data collection, not malicious activity. The security risk is low, but caution is advised due to code quality and obfuscation."
