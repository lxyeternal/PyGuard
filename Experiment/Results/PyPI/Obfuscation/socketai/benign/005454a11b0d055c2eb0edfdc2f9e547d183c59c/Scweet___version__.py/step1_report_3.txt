  "flows": "Tuple assignment -> map() over tuple -> join() to produce string.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward tuple and string operations.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a tuple (3, 2) to a variable, then converts each element to a string and joins them with a dot. There are no hardcoded credentials, environment variable usage, network operations, or obfuscated behaviors. The code is simple and performs basic data formatting without any apparent malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a basic transformation of a tuple into a dot-separated string without any malicious behavior or security risks.",
