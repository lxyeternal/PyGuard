  "conclusion": "The code is a highly obfuscated, feature-rich Twitter scraper primarily intended for data collection. No explicit malware or malicious payloads are detected. Its complexity and automation capabilities warrant cautious risk assessment, but the malware score remains low. The obfuscation level is high, and the potential for misuse justifies a moderate security risk. Overall, scores are aligned with the code's behavior, with a malware score around 0.2, obfuscation at 0.75, and risk at 0.5."
