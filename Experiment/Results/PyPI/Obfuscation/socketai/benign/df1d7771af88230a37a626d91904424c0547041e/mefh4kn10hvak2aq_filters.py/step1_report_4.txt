{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for handling GraphQL types, converting markdown, and normalizing strings for URL or identifier usage.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input parameters of functions, imports modules, and utilizes a utility function from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks such as network, file, or system command execution are present; the code mainly processes data locally.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed through normalization, conversion, and type checking functions, but no untrusted data flows to insecure sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The imported utility function 'zfceRMvtTliWVLRIvSScPfdEBsQWoUro' is named with an obfuscated, non-descriptive name, which could indicate obfuscation or concealment. However, it is used as a data transformation step, not inherently suspicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are evident. The functions perform standard data processing tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and a seemingly obfuscated utility function. It defines functions to classify GraphQL types, convert markdown to HTML, and normalize strings by removing special characters and converting to URL-friendly slugs. The obfuscated utility function's purpose cannot be determined, but it appears to be a data transformation. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The code appears to be standard utility functions with minimal security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign utility functions for data processing related to GraphQL, markdown, and string normalization. The obfuscated utility function is suspicious but used for normal data handling, not malicious activity. No malware or malicious intent is evident, and the security risk level is low.",
