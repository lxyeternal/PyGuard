  "purpose": "Utility functions for GraphQL type classification, Markdown conversion, and string normalization.",
  "sources": "Input parameter to normalization function, imported utility function 'zfceRMvtTliWVLRIvSScPfdEBsQWoUro'.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no external data leaks or network calls.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through normalization and type checking functions; utility function is invoked but its internal behavior is unknown.",
  "anomalies": "Use of an obfuscated utility function 'zfceRMvtTliWVLRIvSScPfdEBsQWoUro'; variable and function names are intentionally obscure.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data processing tasks: classifying GraphQL types, converting Markdown, and normalizing strings. The only suspicious element is the imported utility function with an obfuscated name, whose behavior is unknown. No network activity, system modifications, or malicious code are present. The obfuscation suggests possible concealment but does not confirm malicious intent. The scores across reports consistently show no malware, with obfuscation levels varying from low to high, primarily due to the utility function's naming. The overall security risk remains low, but caution is advised until the utility function's implementation is reviewed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, performing standard utility functions with obfuscated naming. No evidence of malicious activity or security compromise is present. The main concern is the external utility function, which should be reviewed if possible. Overall, the code has a low security risk with moderate obfuscation.",
