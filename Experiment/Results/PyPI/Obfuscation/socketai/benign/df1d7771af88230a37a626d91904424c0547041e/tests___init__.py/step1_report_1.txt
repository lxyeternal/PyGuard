{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform data processing or manipulation, but the exact purpose is unclear due to missing context and lack of comments.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the 'input_data' variable and environment variables such as 'API_KEY'.",
  "sinks": "Data is written to a file 'output.txt', and the environment variable 'API_KEY' is used, potentially exposing sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Data from 'input_data' is processed and then written to 'output.txt'; environment variables are accessed but not sanitized.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or obvious backdoors. Usage of 'exec' with untrusted data is absent. No suspicious network activity or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The script reads input data and environment variables, processes data with standard functions, and writes output to a file. No signs of malicious code, such as network calls, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The use of environment variables is typical, although sensitive keys are handled cautiously. No obfuscation or complex dynamic code execution observed. The code structure is straightforward, and no suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code appears to be a benign data processing script with no evident malicious intent.",
