  "purpose": "Assess open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code content, structure, and suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Input data from variables, environment variables, and external modules; potential sinks include file operations, network calls, or system commands.",
  "sinks": "Writing to files, environment variable access, potential network or system command execution, data output points.",
  "flows": "Input sources (variables, environment) to sinks (file writes, system commands), possibly via data processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, or malicious code detected; code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is simple, reading input data and environment variables, then writing to a file, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious indicators. No network activity or code injection observed. The handling of environment variables is typical but warrants a low security risk score. No anomalies or backdoors identified. Confidence in benign nature is high; malware and obfuscation scores are zero. Security risk is minimal, around 0.2, due to standard data handling. The code structure is clear, with no suspicious flows or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk score is justified. Overall, the dependency appears safe for use, with no evidence of sabotage or malware.",
