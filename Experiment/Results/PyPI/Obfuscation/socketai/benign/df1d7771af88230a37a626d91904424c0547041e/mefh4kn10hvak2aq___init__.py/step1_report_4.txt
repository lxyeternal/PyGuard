{
  "purpose": "This code imports specific classes from a local module 'render' and defines what symbols to export from this module.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the local module '.render'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data, no external network or file operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; only internal class imports and symbol exports.",
  "anomalies": "The imported class names ('AcleCpmSNyBDpWKJrbqPdHvZVKGYQtBD', 'YnHAvvlOCWfDzOdmUylpxfzNMRtNdGnF') are highly unusual, resembling obfuscated or randomly generated identifiers, which could be suspicious. The code does not perform any obvious operations beyond import and export definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, performing a standard import statement and defining __all__ for exports. The class names imported are highly unconventional, indicating possible obfuscation or hidden intent, but the code itself does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. There are no network, file, or environment interactions. The presence of obfuscated class names warrants caution, but on its own, this code does not demonstrate malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and appears to be part of a larger module. The unusual class names could suggest obfuscation, but there is no evidence of malicious behavior within this snippet. It mainly functions as an import and export statement with no security risks or malware indications.",
