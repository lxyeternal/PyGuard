{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that imports specific classes or functions from a local render module and defines an export list for public API.",
  "sources": "The code reads the local module '.render' to import two objects: AcleCpmSNyBDpWKJrbqPdHvZVKGYQtBD and YnHAvvlOCWfDzOdmUylpxfzNMRtNdGnF.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks in this code snippet; no untrusted data processing or output occurs here.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to importing specific classes/functions from a local module, with no data flows to external systems or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "The imported names (AcleCpmSNyBDpWKJrbqPdHvZVKGYQtBD and YnHAvvlOCWfDzOdmUylpxfzNMRtNdGnF) are highly obfuscated, which is unusual and could indicate malicious intent or code obfuscation, but no other suspicious activity is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two seemingly obfuscated identifiers from a local module, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. The code does not contain any logic, network operations, or data processing. The __all__ list suggests intended public API exposure. The obfuscated names could be benign or malicious, but without further context, it's difficult to determine intent. No suspicious behavior or security risks are directly observable in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is minimal and primarily contains imports with obfuscated identifiers. While obfuscation can sometimes indicate malicious intent, in this isolated context, it is not definitive. No malicious activity or security risks are evident, but further review of the imported module is recommended.",
