  "sinks": "None observed in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks are evident in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Imported class names appear to be random, nonsensical strings, which may indicate obfuscation or generated code. The module exports only two functions, but no further code or context is provided.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing two classes with obscure names, possibly auto-generated or obfuscated. The __all__ list indicates intended exports but contains no suspicious or malicious identifiers. Without additional context or code, no malicious behavior or security risks are identifiable.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. The obscure class names may suggest obfuscation, but no malicious intent is apparent. Further context would be needed for a definitive assessment.",
