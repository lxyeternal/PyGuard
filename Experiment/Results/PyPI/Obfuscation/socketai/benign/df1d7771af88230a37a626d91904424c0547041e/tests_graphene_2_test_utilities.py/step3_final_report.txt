  "sinks": "Assertions on schema properties; no external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "Schema object creation, property access, and validation assertions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of an obfuscated utility class name, which may suggest code generation or concealment.",
  "analysis": "The code defines GraphQL schema types and a test case verifying their structure. The imported utility class has an obfuscated name, raising suspicion but not indicating malicious intent. The test performs standard assertions on schema properties without processing untrusted input or performing network operations. No hardcoded credentials, data exfiltration, or malicious code are present. The obfuscation may be for code generation or concealment but does not directly imply malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as schema validation with an obfuscated utility class. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, and the overall security risk is low. The obfuscation warrants further review outside this snippet but does not indicate malicious intent.",
