{
  "purpose": "The code consists of unit tests for the 'graphdoc' module, focusing on rendering, error handling, and output verification.",
  "sources": "Reading local files, environment variables, module imports, and external variables like 'graphql_version'.",
  "sinks": "File reads, mock rendering functions, and exception raising; no network or external data transmission.",
  "flows": "Input data from files or environment variables flows into rendering functions and assertions; no untrusted data flows into sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names, dynamic filenames involving 'graphql_version' (undefined here), suspicious import names, and external dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of standard unit tests with obfuscated identifiers and external dependencies. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code is evident. Obfuscation and dynamic filenames are typical in testing or code concealment but do not imply malicious intent. External variables like 'graphql_version' are environment-dependent and should be validated separately. The tests primarily verify rendering outputs and error handling, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign testing code with obfuscation and external dependencies, but no malicious behavior or supply chain compromise. The malware score is 0, and the security risk is very low (~0.2). The obfuscation level is moderate but typical for test environments.",
