{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a utility module for processing and organizing GraphQL schema definitions, including parsing, schema building, and categorizing various GraphQL types.",
  "sources": "Inputs include GraphQL schema strings or schema objects passed to the main function; internal data structures such as type maps and schema attributes.",
  "sinks": "Schema attributes (query, mutation), type dictionaries, and object/interface lists are manipulated, but no untrusted data is written or transmitted externally.",
  "flows": "Schema strings or objects are parsed/built into schema objects; the schema's type map is processed; type information is categorized; interfaces are linked with their implementations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are evident. The code involves standard schema processing, with no obfuscated or unusual language features. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a utility for handling GraphQL schemas, including parsing strings into schemas, extracting types, and organizing schema components into categories such as objects, scalars, interfaces, enums, and input objects. It performs standard operations like schema introspection, type categorization, and interface implementation mapping. The code uses naming conventions and data structures typical of schema processing, with no signs of malicious logic or external communication. All operations seem to be for schema manipulation within a trusted environment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard schema processing utility with no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It performs schema parsing and organization in a conventional manner without suspicious actions.",
