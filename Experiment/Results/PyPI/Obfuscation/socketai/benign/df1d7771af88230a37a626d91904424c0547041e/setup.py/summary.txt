  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a potentially obfuscated setup script with no direct malicious activity detected. The obfuscation raises suspicion but is not definitive. Given the lack of evidence, the package is likely safe, but caution is advised due to variable obfuscation. Scores should be set low for malware and risk, with a moderate obfuscated score."
