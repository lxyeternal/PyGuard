  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and anomalies.",
  "sources": "Potential use of eval()/exec() with untrusted input, complex control flow, data handling without validation.",
  "sinks": "Execution of dynamically generated code, data leakage points, network communication (if present), file modifications.",
  "flows": "Input sources (e.g., user input, environment variables) leading to eval()/exec() or other risky functions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic code execution functions with untrusted data, obfuscation attempts, lack of code or minimal code presence.",
  "analysis": "The code likely employs eval()/exec() with untrusted input, posing moderate security risks. Obfuscation may be present but not confirmed. Minimal or absent code in some reports limits analysis. The primary concern is dynamic execution, which can lead to malicious activity if misused. Other reports lack code, so their scores are appropriately low. The scores for report 1 should be increased to reflect the high risk associated with unsafe dynamic code execution, with malware score around 0.6, obfuscation at 0.3, and risk at 0.6. The remaining reports are consistent with their minimal content, justifying low scores.",
  "conclusion": "The primary risk stems from dynamic code execution with untrusted input, warranting a higher malware and risk score for report 1. Other reports are benign or lack sufficient content for concern. Overall, the scoring aligns with the evidence, but the malware and risk scores for report 1 should be elevated to reflect the potential for malicious activity.",
