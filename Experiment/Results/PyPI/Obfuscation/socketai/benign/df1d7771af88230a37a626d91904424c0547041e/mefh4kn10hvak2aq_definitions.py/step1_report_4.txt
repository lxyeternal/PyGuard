  "purpose": "Define GraphQL-related data structures and a utility class for handling GraphQL objects",
  "sources": "Initialization of the class with a GraphQL object, attribute access via method",
  "sinks": "Potential attribute access on untrusted GraphQL objects, dynamic attribute access",
  "flows": "Constructor assigns the GraphQL object to an internal variable, method retrieves attributes from this object",
  "anomalies": "Unusual import of a seemingly random class name from dataclasses, no clear validation of input objects, no explicit security checks",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines data classes and a utility class for GraphQL objects. The utility class stores a GraphQL object and provides a method to access its attributes dynamically. The data classes organize collections of GraphQL types, but do not perform any dynamic or risky operations. The import of a seemingly random class from dataclasses and the variable naming conventions appear obfuscated or auto-generated, but this does not indicate malicious intent. There are no network operations, credential handling, or data leaks. The code mainly deals with GraphQL type definitions and attribute access, which is standard for such contexts. No evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware is present. No suspicious code flow or hardcoded secrets are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup for managing GraphQL types and objects with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a standard implementation with obfuscated naming, likely auto-generated or intended for code obfuscation but not malicious.",
