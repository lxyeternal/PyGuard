{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define data structures and classes related to GraphQL schema components, possibly for schema construction or introspection.",
  "sources": "The code reads from imported modules (dataclasses, typing, graphql) and class attributes, notably the '_graphql_field' attribute.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks where untrusted data is processed or output; no functions executing untrusted input or performing unsafe operations are present.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the class methods and data structures do not handle external input directly.",
  "anomalies": "The class 'sMvclCZMAgpHggmkmZYFdJmLDyVeLmVS' stores a graphql object and provides a generic getter method, which is normal. The variable names are obfuscated, but this alone isn't suspicious. The code does not perform any dangerous operations such as network access, file I/O, or execution of untrusted code.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly defines data classes with fields for GraphQL schema components, including types and collections. The only method provided is a generic attribute getter. There is no input parsing, data validation, or execution logic that could be malicious. The obfuscated class and variable names may suggest code obfuscation, but they do not inherently indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials or dangerous patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward definition of data structures related to GraphQL schemas with no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The obfuscated names may hinder readability but do not suggest malicious intent.",
