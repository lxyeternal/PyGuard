  "purpose": "Define GraphQL schema components and a helper class for field access",
  "sources": "Imports from dataclasses, typing, and graphql modules; class initializations; attribute access within class methods",
  "sinks": "Attribute access using getattr, class attribute assignments, list initializations",
  "flows": "Initialization of class instances, attribute access via method calls",
  "anomalies": "Use of non-descriptive, obfuscated-looking class and variable names, but no malicious or suspicious code behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines data classes and a class for managing GraphQL schema objects. It imports standard libraries and the 'graphql' package, and uses them to declare schema components like query, mutation, objects, interfaces, unions, scalars, input_objects, and enums. The class 'sMvclCZMAgpHggmkmZYFdJmLDyVeLmVS' provides a method for attribute retrieval via 'getattr'. There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, network activity, code injection, or malicious data handling. The obfuscated-looking names are likely for obfuscation or auto-generation but do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, non-malicious setup for GraphQL schema components, with no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks detected. It appears to be a standard schema definition module.",
