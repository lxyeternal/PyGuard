      "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a potentially obfuscated setup script with no direct malicious activity detected. The obfuscation raises suspicion but is not definitive. Given the lack of evidence, the package is likely safe, but caution is advised due to variable obfuscation. Scores should be set low for malware and risk, with a moderate obfuscated score."

The main concern is the external utility function, which should be reviewed if possible. Overall, the code has a low security risk with moderate obfuscation."

      "conclusion": "The code is primarily a template rendering utility with signs of obfuscation and dynamic environment setup. While no direct malicious activity is confirmed, the obfuscation and suspicious function names suggest potential misuse, especially if inputs are untrusted. The malware score is estimated around 0.4, obfuscation at 0.7, and overall security risk at 0.4, reflecting moderate concern due to obfuscation but no active malicious indicators."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign based on the provided snippet. Obfuscated class names are suspicious but not sufficient evidence of malicious behavior. The current scores are appropriate, with malware at 0, obfuscation high (~0.7-0.8), and security risk low (~0.1). Further analysis of the 'render' module is advised for comprehensive security assessment."

      "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated GraphQL schema utility with dynamic attribute access. No malicious activity or backdoors are evident. The primary concern is obfuscation and the potential misuse of 'getattr' if the input objects are malicious. The malware score remains at 0, and the security risk is low but should be reviewed in context. The obfuscation level is high, but this alone does not indicate malicious intent."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard GraphQL schema utility module with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The obfuscation in variable naming is minimal and not indicative of malicious intent. The security risk is low, and the malware score is 0. The obfuscation score is around 0.2 due to variable naming, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.2. The code is safe for use in trusted environments, with caution advised if schema inputs are untrusted."

      "conclusion": "The primary risk stems from dynamic code execution with untrusted input, warranting a higher malware and risk score for report 1. Other reports are benign or lack sufficient content for concern. Overall, the scoring aligns with the evidence, but the malware and risk scores for report 1 should be elevated to reflect the potential for malicious activity."
