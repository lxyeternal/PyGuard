  "purpose": "Format a given Python code string using the Black formatter library.",
  "sources": "Importing the 'black' library, reading the 'unformatted' string parameter.",
  "sinks": "Calling black.format_str with the 'unformatted' input, which could process untrusted code if provided.",
  "flows": "Input 'unformatted' -> black.format_str -> formatted output.",
  "anomalies": "The code imports 'black' without any suspicious behavior; no hardcoded credentials or hidden code. The variable BNMcGWGlmbjqoPpZbaZdTpEeKzjYHTOd appears to be a version string but is unused. The function wraps a standard library call without validation or restrictions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'black' code formatter, defines a version string, and provides a function that formats an input string using 'black'. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The variable with a complex name is unused, indicating no hidden behavior. The function is a simple wrapper around a known safe library. No suspicious code execution or obfuscated code is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a simple wrapper to format code strings with the 'black' formatter. No malicious intent or security risks are evident based on this fragment.",
