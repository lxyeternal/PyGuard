  "purpose": "The code formats a given Python code string using the Black formatter.",
  "sources": "The function receives 'unformatted' and '_info_str' as input parameters.",
  "sinks": "The 'black.format_str' function acts as a sink where untrusted input could potentially be processed.",
  "flows": "Input parameter 'unformatted' flows directly into 'black.format_str', which processes and returns formatted code.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of an unrelated variable 'BNMcGWGlmbjqoPpZbaZdTpEeKzjYHTOd' with a version string; variable name appears obfuscated or randomly generated. No other suspicious code or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'black' code formatter library, which is used for code formatting. It defines a function that takes unformatted code and an info string, then returns the formatted code. The variable with a random name and version string appears to be non-functional and possibly obfuscated, but it does not affect the behavior. No network activity, credential handling, or malicious actions are evident. The function simply wraps a standard formatting call.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign function of formatting Python code using Black with no signs of malicious intent. The only anomaly is an obfuscated variable name and a version string, which are not suspicious by themselves. Overall, this appears to be a standard utility function with no malicious behavior.",
