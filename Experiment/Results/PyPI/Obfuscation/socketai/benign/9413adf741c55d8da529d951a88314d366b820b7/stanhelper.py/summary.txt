  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Stan interface with a primary security concern related to subprocess command injection via unvalidated inputs. No malware or obfuscation is present. The overall security risk is moderate but manageable with input sanitization. The malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate at zero; the risk score should be around 0.3."
