  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for package distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file into an obfuscated variable.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or data exfiltration present.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' into variable, then passing metadata to setup() function.",
  "anomalies": "Use of an unusual, obfuscated variable name for the README content; no malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with no network activity, code injection, or malicious behavior. The only anomaly is the obfuscated variable name, which is superficial and not malicious. No external data sources or sinks are involved. The code performs standard package setup operations, and the variable name does not impact security. The malware score is zero, indicating no malicious intent. The obfuscation score is modest (~0.2) due to the unusual variable name, but this does not suggest malicious obfuscation. The security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting the benign nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with superficial obfuscation. No malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores should reflect minimal risk and low suspicion, with a slight acknowledgment of obfuscation.",
