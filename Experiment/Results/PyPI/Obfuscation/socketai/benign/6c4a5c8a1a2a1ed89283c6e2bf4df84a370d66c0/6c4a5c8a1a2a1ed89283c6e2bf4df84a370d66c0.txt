      "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated data analysis script performing correlation and differencing tasks. There is no evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, or supply chain sabotage. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not indicate malicious intent. The overall security risk is low, and the malware likelihood is negligible."

      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a feature extraction pipeline with heavily obfuscated external dependencies. Static analysis shows no direct malicious actions, but the obfuscation and inconsistent variable references warrant caution. The external module could conceal malicious behavior, so further dynamic analysis or source review is recommended before deployment."
