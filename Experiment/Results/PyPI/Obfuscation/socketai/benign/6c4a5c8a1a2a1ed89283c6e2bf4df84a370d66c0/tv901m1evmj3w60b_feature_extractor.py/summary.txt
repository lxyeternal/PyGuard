  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated data analysis script performing correlation and differencing tasks. There is no evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, or supply chain sabotage. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not indicate malicious intent. The overall security risk is low, and the malware likelihood is negligible."
