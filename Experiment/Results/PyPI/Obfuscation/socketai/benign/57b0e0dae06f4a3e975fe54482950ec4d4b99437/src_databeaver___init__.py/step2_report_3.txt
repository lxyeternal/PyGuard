  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of malicious behavior, the appropriateness of the scores, and any inconsistencies.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple relative import statement: `from .lib import *`.\n- None of the reports find direct malicious activity based solely on this line.\n- The main concern raised is the use of wildcard import (`import *`), which can obscure what is imported and potentially hide malicious code within the 'lib' module.\n- The confidence levels vary from 0.3 to 0.6, reflecting the uncertainty about potential risks.\n- Malware scores are uniformly 0, which aligns with the fact that the code itself does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Potential Issues:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Behavior:**\n   - The code snippet itself does **not** contain any malicious behavior. It is merely an import statement.\n   - The risk of malicious activity depends entirely on the contents of the 'lib' module, which is not provided.\n   - The reports correctly state that without inspecting 'lib', malicious intent cannot be confirmed.\n\n2. **Use of Wildcard Import (`import *`):**\n   - All reports mention that using `from .lib import *` is discouraged due to maintainability and clarity issues.\n   - This practice can hide malicious code if 'lib' is malicious, but the import statement alone is not malicious.\n\n3. **Risk and Malware Scores:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the code.\n   - Security risk scores are low (0.2), reflecting the potential for risk if 'lib' is malicious, but not indicating any direct threat.\n\n4. **Confidence Levels:**\n   - Varying from 0.3 to 0.6, these seem reasonable given the limited context.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations for Score Adjustments:\n\n- Since **no actual malicious activity is present** in the provided code, **malware scores should remain at 0**.\n- The **security risk score of 0.2** is acceptable, as the use of wildcard import can be considered a minor security concern, especially if 'lib' is malicious.\n- The **obfuscated score** remains at 0, which is correct; there's no evidence of obfuscation.\n- The **confidence levels** could be slightly lowered in some reports (e.g., from 0.6 to 0.4) because the suspicion is mainly about the import style, not the code content itself.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n| Report | Original Malware Score | Justification | Suggested Malware Score |\n|---------|-------------------------|-----------------|------------------------|\n| 1       | 0                       | No malicious behavior in the import statement | 0                      |\n| 2       | 0                       | Same reasoning | 0                      |\n| 3       | 0                       | Same reasoning | 0                      |\n| 4       | 0                       | Same reasoning | 0                      |\n| 5       | 0                       | Same reasoning | 0                      |\n\n**Overall estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (due to wildcard import, which can be risky if 'lib' is malicious)\n\n---\n\n### Final notes:\n\n- The main concern is the use of `import *`, which can hide malicious code if 'lib' is compromised.\n- Without further context or inspection of 'lib', no definitive malicious activity can be confirmed.\n- The scores should reflect the current evidence: no malware, low risk, no obfuscation.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Confirmed no malicious code in the snippet.\n- Scores should be: **malware = 0**, **obfuscated = 0**, **risk = 0.2**.\n- The concern about wildcard import remains valid but does not indicate malicious intent by itself.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a detailed review of the 'lib' module contents or further analysis.",
