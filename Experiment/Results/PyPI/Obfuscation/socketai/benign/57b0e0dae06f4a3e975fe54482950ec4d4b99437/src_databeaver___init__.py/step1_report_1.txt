  "purpose": "Import all functions and variables from the local 'lib' module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the current package's 'lib' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present in this single line of code; potential risks depend on subsequent code that uses imported elements.",
  "flows": "Data flow depends on how imported components are used later; not evident in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from .lib import *' can lead to unclear namespace and potential conflicts, but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple relative import statement, bringing all contents of the 'lib' module into the current namespace. This practice can obscure the origin of functions or variables and may pose maintainability issues. However, on its own, it does not indicate malicious behavior. Since no other code is provided, it’s impossible to identify any malicious actions or hidden backdoors at this stage. The code is minimal and standard for Python modules.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this single line, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The import style is discouraged but not malicious. Further code is needed to assess any potential security issues.",
