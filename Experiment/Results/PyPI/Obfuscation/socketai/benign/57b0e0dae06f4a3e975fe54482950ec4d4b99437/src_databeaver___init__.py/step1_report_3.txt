  "purpose": "Import all functions, classes, and variables from the 'lib' module within the same package.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads data from the local 'lib' module/package.",
  "sinks": "No immediate sinks or data leaks are apparent in this single line of code.",
  "flows": "N/A - only an import statement without further code to analyze data flow.",
  "anomalies": "The use of a relative import with a wildcard ('*') can hide what is actually imported, potentially masking malicious or unnecessary code, but by itself, it is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single import statement using a relative import with a wildcard, which can be considered bad practice due to lack of clarity about imported content. Without additional code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The statement itself does not perform any actions beyond importing modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a simple import with no evident malicious intent or security risks. However, the use of wildcard imports can obscure imported content, which could hide malicious or unintended code if the 'lib' module is malicious. More context is needed for a thorough assessment.",
