  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully and systematically.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports concern a single line of code: `from .lib import *`\n- The code is a relative import of all symbols from a local module named 'lib'.\n- None of the reports indicate actual malicious behavior, but many highlight the risks associated with wildcard imports, such as obscured namespace and potential hiding of malicious code within 'lib'.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, indicating no evidence of malicious activity based solely on this line.\n- The confidence levels vary from 0.3 to 0.6, reflecting some uncertainty about potential risks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues in code:**  \n  The code is a simple import statement. No issues are present in the code itself; it is syntactically correct and standard in Python, albeit discouraged due to best practices.\n\n- **Malicious behavior:**  \n  No evidence of malware is present in this snippet. The malware score should remain at 0 unless additional context suggests malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Flaws or mistakes in the reports:\n- The reports correctly identify the risks of wildcard imports, but they do not link this to actual malicious activity.\n- The conclusion that the code is benign is appropriate; however, some reports suggest \"potential\" risks without concrete evidence.\n- The reports do not challenge the assumption that the module 'lib' could be malicious; while it's a valid concern, without evidence, this remains speculative.\n\n### Scores and reasoning:\n- **Malware score:** 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity is demonstrated.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is appropriate; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Given the minimal code and lack of evidence, a low risk score (~0.2) is justified. The higher confidence in some reports (0.6) might overstate the risk, but since they highlight potential issues, a small adjustment is acceptable.\n\n### Justification for higher risk scores:\n- No justification exists for scores above 0.5 because:\n  - The code is simple and standard.\n  - No suspicious behavior or data flows are evident.\n  - The use of wildcard import is a best practice violation but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no evidence of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** (low, based on potential issues with wildcard import, but no actual threat)\n\n---\n\n### Additional comments:\n- If the 'lib' module were malicious or obfuscated, that would change the risk profile, but with only this import statement, we cannot assume that.\n- The reports should emphasize that the actual security risk depends on the contents of 'lib', which is unknown.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Recommendation | Justification                                              |\n|------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                      | No evidence of malicious activity in the import statement. |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                      | The code is straightforward and not obfuscated.             |\n| Security Risk    | 0.2                    | Slight concern due to wildcard import, but no malicious activity detected. |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign; the scores should reflect minimal risk, with no malware or obfuscation concerns.",
