{
  "purpose": "The code attempts to import all functions, classes, or variables from a local module named 'lib'.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads from a local module file named 'lib'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling points are present in this single line of code.",
  "flows": "No data flow is observable from this isolated import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a relative import with '*', which can be problematic for security, debugging, and clarity but is not inherently malicious. No other anomalies are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting only of a relative import statement. This line alone does not demonstrate malicious behavior but indicates reliance on external code in 'lib'. Since the import is from a local module, the risk depends on the contents of 'lib', which are not provided. The use of a wildcard import can be risky in broader context but is not malicious by itself.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there is no evidence of malicious behavior. It is a simple import, though the use of wildcard import is generally discouraged due to potential security and maintenance issues.",
