  "purpose": "The code imports all symbols from a local module named 'lib'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module 'lib'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code only performs an import.",
  "flows": "No data flow; just an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import 'from .lib import *' can hide suspicious or malicious code within the imported module, especially if the module's contents are malicious or obfuscated.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement that imports everything from a local module named 'lib'. While the import statement itself is benign, the use of 'import *' can be suspicious as it may hide malicious functions or variables within 'lib'. Since the actual contents of 'lib' are not provided, any malicious behavior would reside within that module, and this statement alone cannot confirm malicious intent but warrants caution. There are no other code fragments, input sources, or data flows to analyze. The minimal nature of the code does not allow for direct malicious activity, but the potential for malicious code exists within the imported module.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a simple import statement with no inherent malicious behavior. However, due to the use of a wildcard import and lack of visibility into 'lib', there is some risk associated if 'lib' contains malicious code. Overall, the snippet alone appears benign but warrants further review of the 'lib' module.",
