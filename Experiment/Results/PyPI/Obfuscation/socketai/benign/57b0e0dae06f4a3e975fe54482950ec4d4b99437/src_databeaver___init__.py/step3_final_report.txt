  "purpose": "Import all symbols from the local 'lib' module using a relative import.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no data input or external sources are read in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this code snippet; it only imports symbols without executing or passing data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows; the import loads symbols into the namespace but does not process untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' which can obscure imported symbols and potentially hide malicious code within 'lib'.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a relative import of all symbols from 'lib'. This practice is discouraged due to namespace pollution and maintainability issues. No malicious activity is evident in this snippet; the actual risk depends on the contents of 'lib'. The import statement itself is benign, but the wildcard import could hide malicious code if 'lib' is compromised. The malware score is appropriately 0, as no malicious behavior is demonstrated. The security risk score is low (0.2), reflecting potential risks associated with wildcard imports. Confidence in this assessment is high (around 0.8), given the simplicity of the code and lack of evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign but uses a risky import style. The actual security risk depends on the contents of 'lib', which are unknown. No malicious activity is evident, and the scores should reflect minimal risk with a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a low security risk score (~0.2).",
