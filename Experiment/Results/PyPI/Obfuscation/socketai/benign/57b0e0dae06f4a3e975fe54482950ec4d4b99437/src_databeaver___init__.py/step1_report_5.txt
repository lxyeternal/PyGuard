  "anomalies": "Use of relative import with wildcard import; potential for hiding malicious code within the imported module",
  "analysis": "This code only performs a wildcard import from a local module named 'lib'. The import itself does not contain malicious behavior, but it could potentially hide malicious code if 'lib' contains harmful scripts. The snippet does not show any further data processing or external interactions. As this is just an import statement, the risk depends on the content of 'lib', which is not provided.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself is minimal and standard, but the security assessment depends on the contents of the imported 'lib' module. Without inspecting 'lib', we cannot definitively determine malicious intent. The use of a wildcard import warrants caution, as it can obscure imported code.",
