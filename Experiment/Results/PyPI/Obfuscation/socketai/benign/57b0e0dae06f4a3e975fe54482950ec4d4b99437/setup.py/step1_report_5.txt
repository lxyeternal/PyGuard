{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'ff4fyx6xuwl4ye06' including package data and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No evident untrusted data sinks; no network, file writes, or other external output observed.",
  "flows": "Reads file content into variable; no flow of untrusted data to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The variable names are nonsensical and obfuscated, but no malicious logic or suspicious behavior is evident. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code identified.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and reads a README.md file for package description. It then calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and scripts. Variable names are obfuscated, but the structure follows standard setup.py conventions. No suspicious code, malicious logic, or external network activity detected. No insecure practices such as use of environment variables, dynamic code execution, or credential handling are present. The code appears to be a standard package setup script with obfuscated variable names.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names, likely to hinder readability, but contains no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely to configure package installation.",
