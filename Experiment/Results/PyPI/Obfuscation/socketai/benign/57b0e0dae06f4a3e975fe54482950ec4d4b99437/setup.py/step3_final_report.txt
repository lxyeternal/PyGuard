  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script using setuptools, reading README.md for description, defining metadata, dependencies, package data, and scripts.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file; static package metadata and data; no untrusted input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data; no network calls, code injection, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Reads file content; static data used in setup parameters; no dynamic data flow or external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names (e.g., PjYNvLCPXdBdukWsLrHrhlvbrTYaqyfR); no malicious code, network activity, or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with obfuscated variable names, which could be an attempt to hinder readability but does not indicate malicious intent. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted input handling is present. The obfuscation is superficial and does not affect the benign nature of the script. All security signals point to a safe, standard package configuration. The malware score is correctly assigned as 0, and the obfuscation score reflects the variable name obfuscation but remains below levels indicating malicious intent. The overall security risk is minimal.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated setup script with no signs of malware or malicious activity. The obfuscation appears superficial and intended for obscurity rather than malicious purposes. The current scores are justified and consistent with the code's nature.",
