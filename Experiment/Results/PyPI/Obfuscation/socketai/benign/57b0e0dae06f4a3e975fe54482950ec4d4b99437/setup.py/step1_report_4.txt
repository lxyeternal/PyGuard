{
  "purpose": "The code is setting up a Python package for distribution, including reading a README file and configuring package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file to obtain long description; package configuration data such as dependencies, package data, and scripts.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data handling or output to external systems.",
  "flows": "Read README.md content as long description; package setup configuration from static data and files.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names (e.g., PjYNvLCPXdBdukWsLrHrhlvbrTYaqyfR), which may be used to hide malicious intent, but are also common in obfuscated or minified code. No hardcoded credentials, network calls, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup using setuptools, reading the README file to include as the long description. Variable names are non-descriptive, which can be a red flag, but do not necessarily indicate malicious activity. All data used in setup parameters are static or read from a file; no dynamic or external inputs are processed. No network activity, credential handling, or other malicious patterns are present. The code appears to be a typical setup script with obfuscated variable names but no malicious intent identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names, which could be suspicious but does not contain any malicious behavior upon review. No malware or security risks are evident.",
