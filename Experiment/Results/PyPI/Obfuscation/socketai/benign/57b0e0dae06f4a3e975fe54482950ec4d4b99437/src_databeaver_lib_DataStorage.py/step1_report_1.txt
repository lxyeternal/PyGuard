  "purpose": "Define a database table schema class and methods for creating, dropping, and managing database objects with logging.",
  "sources": "Imports modules, class constructor, methods receiving parameters, object type checks, and logging statements.",
  "sinks": "Logging functions (`warning`, `info`), method calls that likely interact with databases (`DgNnjXbjPQVFRbBAfPDUxBouyaocswEz`, `mAPFcryMLVzwaJyBrToJqHZdgusdLFEJ`), object attributes used in SQL or database operations.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (object_to_create, object_to_drop, schema_name) flow into type checks and method calls; log messages are generated based on object types; database operations are performed with object attributes.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variable and class names, use of custom class types for schema and table objects, and logging of schema/table creation and deletion without clear validation or sanitization. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious network activity. No malicious code or backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages database schema objects with logging. It performs type checks to ensure correct object handling, calls database manipulation functions, and raises errors for unimplemented methods. No signs of malware, data exfiltration, or suspicious network activity. Variable names are obfuscated but used consistently within the context of database schema management. The code's logic is typical for ORM-like operations. No suspicious patterns or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears to be a standard database schema management class with logging and object handling. No malicious intent, no malware indicators, and no security risks are evident. The obfuscated variable names do not imply malicious activity but reduce code readability. Overall, it seems to be a benign component for database schema operations.",
