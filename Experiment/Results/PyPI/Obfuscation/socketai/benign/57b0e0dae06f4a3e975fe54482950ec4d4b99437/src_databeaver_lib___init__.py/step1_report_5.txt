  "purpose": "Import modules and classes from the same package to facilitate functionality within the package.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing constants and classes from local modules within the package.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; import statements do not constitute data flow in the traditional sense.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual aspect: the use of non-descriptive, seemingly obfuscated names for imported classes (e.g., xSgnOgyxlXzujxdrcQEFkxbGTVDnrEon, yiNXanxOdxJdNeXRBECxjsdOGElKbGFf). No other suspicious activity detected in the snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, bringing in constants and classes from sibling modules. The use of obfuscated names for some classes could be a sign of intentional concealment or just obfuscated naming, but no malicious behavior can be inferred solely from import statements. No inputs, data handling, or network activity is present in this fragment. Importing modules is a common and benign operation.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward set of import statements with some obfuscated class names. There are no signs of malicious activity, data leakage, or security risks based on this snippet alone. The obfuscated names warrant a review of the actual class definitions, but this code segment itself appears safe.",
