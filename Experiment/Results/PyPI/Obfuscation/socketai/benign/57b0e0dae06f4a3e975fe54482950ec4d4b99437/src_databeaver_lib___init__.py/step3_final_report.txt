  "purpose": "Analyze the provided import statements for potential malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules, including obfuscated class/module names.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No executable code; only import statements, so no source-to-sink data flows exist.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated class and module names, which could be used to conceal malicious intent or hide functionality.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with obfuscated names, indicating potential concealment. No executable logic, data handling, or network activity is visible. The obfuscated names are suspicious but not definitive evidence of malicious activity. Malware scores are appropriately low (0), reflecting the absence of active malicious code. Obfuscation scores are high (~0.6-0.7), aligning with the suspicion raised by obfuscated identifiers. Security risk scores are low (~0.2-0.3), consistent with the limited scope but cautious due to obfuscation. The overall assessment suggests benign code in isolation but warrants further review of the imported modules for malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The import statements are benign in isolation; no malicious activity is evident. Obfuscated names are suspicious and should prompt further inspection of the actual module implementations. The current scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: ~0.7, security risk: ~0.2) are appropriate given the evidence. Continued monitoring and review of the imported modules are recommended to ensure security.",
