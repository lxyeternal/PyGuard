      "conclusion": "The code is benign but uses a risky import style. The actual security risk depends on the contents of 'lib', which are unknown. No malicious activity is evident, and the scores should reflect minimal risk with a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a low security risk score (~0.2)."

      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code is an obfuscated database handler supporting PostgreSQL and MySQL, with no direct evidence of malicious activity. The primary security concern is potential SQL injection if inputs are not sanitized before being used in SQL commands. The obfuscation complicates analysis but does not inherently imply malicious intent. The low malware score reflects the absence of active malicious behavior, while the moderate risk score accounts for obfuscation and potential injection vulnerabilities."

The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. The primary concern is obfuscation, which does not imply malicious intent but warrants cautious monitoring. Overall, the package can be considered low risk and safe for use."

The primary concern is the obfuscation, which warrants further review of 'data_storage' and overall context. Scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with this analysis."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, obfuscated database schema management class with no malicious intent or security risks. The high obfuscation is likely for concealment but does not imply malicious activity. The malware score is appropriately set to 0, and the security risk is low. Overall, the code appears benign and does not pose a security threat based on the provided snippet."

      "conclusion": "The import statements are benign in isolation; no malicious activity is evident. Obfuscated names are suspicious and should prompt further inspection of the actual module implementations. The current scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: ~0.7, security risk: ~0.2) are appropriate given the evidence. Continued monitoring and review of the imported modules are recommended to ensure security."

      "conclusion": "The dependency exhibits high obfuscation and unsafe SQL practices, leading to significant security risks, particularly SQL injection vulnerabilities. There is no direct evidence of malware activity such as data theft or remote code execution. The code should be refactored to use parameterized queries, variables should be clearly defined, and obfuscation should be removed to improve security and maintainability."

There is no direct evidence of malware or malicious payloads, but the obfuscation and lack of input validation pose moderate security risks. Further static analysis and input sanitization are recommended before deployment."
