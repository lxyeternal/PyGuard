{
  "purpose": "The code provides database management functions such as connecting to a server, creating tables, deleting rows, dropping tables, and inserting data into tables.",
  "sources": "Input sources include parameters such as table names, columns, data, keys to delete, and connection objects. The connection object is used to establish database communication.",
  "sinks": "Data is executed via SQL statements through database connection methods, such as executing select, insert, and drop statements.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., table names, data) flow into SQL statement generation and execution functions. These SQL commands are then sent to the database connection for execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are visible. No obfuscated code or unusual language constructs. All code appears to be standard database operation logic. No suspicious network activity or data exfiltration points are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of database utility functions that perform typical operations such as creating tables, deleting rows, inserting data, and dropping tables. The functions use parameterized inputs and execute SQL commands via a connection object. There is no evidence of hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The use of a context manager for database connection management indicates standard practice. Overall, the code performs expected database interactions without suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard database management tasks with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate database utility module without any anomalous or harmful behavior.",
