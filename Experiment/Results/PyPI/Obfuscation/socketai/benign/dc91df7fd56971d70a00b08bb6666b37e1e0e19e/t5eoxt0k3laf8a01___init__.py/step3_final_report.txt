  "purpose": "A minimal Python script that prints a static message when executed directly.",
  "sources": "The script reads the '__main__' module context to determine execution; no external input or data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code only outputs a static string to the console.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code simply executes a print statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward script with a main guard that prints a fixed message. It does not process external data, perform network operations, or include any suspicious constructs. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and appropriate. No modifications or further analysis are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
