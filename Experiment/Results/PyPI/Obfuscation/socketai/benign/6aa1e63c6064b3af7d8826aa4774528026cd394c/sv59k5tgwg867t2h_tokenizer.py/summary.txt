  "conclusion": "The code is a typical ML inference module with superficial obfuscation and singleton pattern usage. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or supply chain compromise. The malware score is 0, the obfuscation score is moderate (~0.3), and the overall security risk is low (~0.2)."
