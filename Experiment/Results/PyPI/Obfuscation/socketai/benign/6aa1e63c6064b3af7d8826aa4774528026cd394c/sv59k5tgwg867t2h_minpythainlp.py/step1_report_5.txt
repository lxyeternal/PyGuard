{
  "purpose": "The function converts specific Unicode numeral characters into standard ASCII digits, effectively normalizing numeric strings that may contain Thai numerals.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'text' and iteration over each character in 'text'.",
  "sinks": "The output string generated by the function; no external sinks are used.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' -> character iteration -> character mapping or preservation -> output string.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses obfuscated variable names, which could be an attempt to hide its purpose. It only performs a character substitution based on a specific mapping; no other suspicious behavior or backdoors are present. No hardcoded credentials, network access, or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a mapping of Thai numeral Unicode characters to ASCII digits. It checks for input validity (non-empty string), then iterates through each character, replacing Thai numerals with ASCII digits where applicable, or leaving other characters unchanged. Variable names are intentionally obscure, which might be an obfuscation tactic, but the logic is straightforward. No suspicious network activity, data leakage, or malicious actions are present. The function seems designed for numeric string normalization, possibly as part of data preprocessing.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign Unicode character replacement for numeral normalization, with no evidence of malicious behavior. The obfuscated variable names may suggest an attempt to conceal intent, but the logic itself is harmless.",
