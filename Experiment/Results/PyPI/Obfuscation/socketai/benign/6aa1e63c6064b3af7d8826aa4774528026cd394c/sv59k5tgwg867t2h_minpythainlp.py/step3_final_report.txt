{
  "purpose": "Convert Thai numerals to ASCII digits by transliteration.",
  "sources": "Characters in the input string, specifically Thai numerals (๐-๙).",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write to files, send data over network, or interact with environment variables.",
  "flows": "Input string characters are read; Thai numerals are replaced with ASCII digits; other characters pass through unchanged.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are obfuscated, but logic is straightforward; no malicious or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple transliteration of Thai numerals to ASCII digits using a dictionary. It validates input type and non-emptiness, then iterates over each character, replacing Thai numerals with corresponding ASCII digits, appending other characters unchanged. No external I/O, network activity, or environment interactions are present. Variable obfuscation is superficial and does not indicate malicious intent. The logic is benign, serving as a localization utility. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The obfuscation does not conceal malicious activity; it appears superficial.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for normalizing Thai numerals into ASCII digits. No malicious behavior, malware, or security vulnerabilities are present. Obfuscation is superficial and does not imply malicious intent. The overall security risk is negligible, and the malware score should be 0.",
