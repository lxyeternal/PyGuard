{
  "purpose": "The function converts certain Thai numeral characters in a string to their ASCII digit equivalents, performing a character substitution for localization purposes.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'text', which is a string provided to the function.",
  "sinks": "The returned string; the code does not write data externally or execute untrusted commands.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' -> character iteration -> character replacement via lookup -> output string",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors observed. The character mapping appears straightforward. The function does not perform any network activity, system calls, or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a mapping for Thai numerals to ASCII digits. It validates input type and non-emptiness, then iterates over each character, replacing Thai numerals with ASCII digits, and leaves other characters unchanged. The implementation is simple, standard, and safe. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a localized character conversion utility with no malicious intent or security risks. It is a benign utility function for character substitution, likely intended for handling Thai numeral text normalization.",
