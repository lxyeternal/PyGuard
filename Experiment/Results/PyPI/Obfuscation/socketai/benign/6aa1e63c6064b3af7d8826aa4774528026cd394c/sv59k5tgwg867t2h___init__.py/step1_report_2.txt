{
  "purpose": "Import specific classes or variables from local modules within a package, likely related to version information and tokenization.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules: .version and .tokenizer.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external outputs observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; only internal module references.",
  "anomalies": "Imported identifiers have obfuscated or nonsensical names, which may suggest attempts at hiding or obfuscation, but could also be just naming conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes or variables with seemingly random or obfuscated names from internal modules. There is no evidence of dynamic execution, code injection, or external network activity. The naming pattern is unusual but does not inherently indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. The obfuscation appears to be limited to variable naming, not code structure or logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily performs benign internal imports with obfuscated variable names. No malicious behavior or security risks are apparent based on this fragment. The obfuscation may be intentional to conceal implementation details but does not suggest malicious activity.",
