  "purpose": "Import specific classes or variables from local modules 'version' and 'tokenizer'.",
  "sources": "Reading from local modules within the package: '.version' and '.tokenizer'.",
  "targets": "Import statements bringing in specific classes or variables into the namespace.",
  "flows": "Not applicable - the code only imports symbols from local modules; no data flows or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class/variable names (e.g., 'LicGqeYKpaiHONvuJcLiOqjmzuROjBqa', 'BHYlqPkDRsFbAFAInGbAkysNGlaGBMQK') which could conceal malicious intent or sensitive data. No additional code logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements importing symbols with obfuscated names from local modules. Such naming could be an attempt to hide malicious or sensitive content, but on its own, this is not conclusive. There are no external data reads, network calls, or suspicious behaviors observed. The use of obfuscated identifiers raises suspicion, but without further code, it is not definitively malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code only performs imports from local modules with obfuscated names. While this pattern could hide malicious intent, on its own, it is not enough to conclude malicious behavior. The obfuscation warrants caution, but no active malicious actions are evident here.",
