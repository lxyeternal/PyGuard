  "purpose": "Import specific classes or variables from local modules for use within the package",

  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or external data outputs are visible in this snippet",
  "flows": "Imported names are used elsewhere in the package; no flow from external input to untrusted sinks shown",
  "anomalies": "The imported identifiers (LicGqeYKpaiHONvuJcLiOqjmzuROjBqa, BHYlqPkDRsFbAFAInGbAkysNGlaGBMQK, QxmYyZIBYXJGFyszylPgbHeMADtZCZIc, xSFsHzQGNHnLNYpsloITgEXIBjfWlXsD) are highly obfuscated, indicating potential concealment or code obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward relative imports of symbols from local modules. The imported names are heavily obfuscated, which could be an attempt to hide malicious intent or internal logic. There are no external inputs, network calls, or data processing observed in this snippet. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious behavior on its own. The overall structure is minimal and standard for package internal imports, but the naming warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself is simple, importing obfuscated identifiers, which could be legitimate or potentially malicious concealment. No explicit malicious activity or security risks are evident in this snippet alone. However, the obfuscation of imported names is suspicious and warrants further review of the related modules.",
