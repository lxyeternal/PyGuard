{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific attributes or functions from local modules, likely for use within the larger package or application.",
  "sources": "Imports from .version and .tokenizer modules, specifically 'LicGqeYKpaiHONvuJcLiOqjmzuROjBqa' and several variables from 'tokenizer'.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data outputs, network calls, or untrusted data handling shown.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only imports symbols and does not process untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "Module and variable names are obfuscated or randomly generated, which can be suspicious but are not definitive evidence of malicious intent. No code executes here; it’s only import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules. The imported symbols have obfuscated names, which could be a sign of attempts to hide malicious logic or just code obfuscation. There is no evidence of code injection, network activity, data leakage, or malicious behavior in this snippet. Since it is only importing symbols, it cannot be malicious on its own. However, obfuscated symbol names warrant further review of the actual modules.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is limited to import statements with obfuscated names. There is no direct malicious behavior or security risk evident here. The obfuscated names may be benign or part of an obfuscation strategy, but without additional context, no malicious activity can be confirmed.",
