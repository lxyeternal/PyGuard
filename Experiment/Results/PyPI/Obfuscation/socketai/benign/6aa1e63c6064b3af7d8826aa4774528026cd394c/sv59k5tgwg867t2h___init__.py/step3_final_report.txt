{
  "purpose": "Import internal version and tokenizer components, likely for package functionality.",
  "sources": "Local modules '.version' and '.tokenizer' from which symbols are imported.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data flows are present; only import statements.",
  "flows": "Import statements bring symbols into scope; no data flow beyond module loading.",
  "anomalies": "Identifiers are heavily obfuscated, which could be concealment but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with obfuscated names, indicating no active malicious behavior or data processing. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. No network activity, data exfiltration, or code execution is evident. The low malware and security risk scores are appropriate, while the high obfuscation score reflects suspicion due to naming. Further review of the actual modules could clarify intent but is outside this code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as internal module imports with obfuscated identifiers. No malicious activity is detected based solely on this fragment. The obfuscation warrants further review of the modules themselves, but the current assessment indicates minimal risk.",
