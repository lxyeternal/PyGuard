  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data is being processed or transmitted",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; just imports",
  "anomalies": "Imported identifiers (LicGqeYKpaiHONvuJcLiOqjmzuROjBqa, BHYlqPkDRsFbAFAInGbAkysNGlaGBMQK, QxmYyZIBYXJGFyszylPgbHeMADtZCZIc, xSFsHzQGNHnLNYpsloITgEXIBjfWlXsD) appear obfuscated, with no descriptive naming; no explicit secrets or malicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code performs simple import statements from local modules using non-descriptive, obfuscated names. There are no direct data inputs, outputs, or suspicious behaviors such as network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads. The obfuscated naming could be an attempt to hide intent, but within this fragment, it only indicates possible code concealment rather than malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is limited to import statements with obfuscated identifiers and shows no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be standard module import code with no malicious intent detected.",
