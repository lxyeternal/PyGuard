  "purpose": "Compute binary classification evaluation metrics including true positives, false positives, false negatives, precision, recall, F1 score, and related ratios using numpy arrays.",
  "sources": "Input numpy arrays representing predicted and true labels.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network operations, or side effects are present.",
  "flows": "Element-wise multiplication of predicted and true label arrays, followed by summation to calculate metrics.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated variable names; no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard binary classification metric calculations with numpy, using element-wise operations and summations. Variable names are intentionally obfuscated, but the logic is straightforward and aligns with common practices. No external data flows, network activity, or malicious patterns are present. The calculations are correct, and the code does not contain any malicious logic, code injection, or obfuscation techniques beyond variable naming. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, risk≈0.1, obfuscation high) are justified given the benign nature of the code and superficial obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of classification metrics with superficial obfuscation in variable names. No malicious activity or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores and assessments across reports are appropriate and consistent.",
