  "purpose": "The code calculates evaluation metrics for binary classification tasks, such as true positives, false positives, and derived statistics like precision, recall, F1 score, and related ratios.",
  "sources": "Input arrays VNpNOPECUOvCUEhuIvPiUbFfXGkCfOVF and YGUQylDkAjtzioyDSggCWsrabIJuYLnL, which are expected to be arrays of integers representing predicted and true labels.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data are present; the function only performs arithmetic operations on provided arrays.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays through calculations involving element-wise multiplication and summation, culminating in metric calculations returned as a namedtuple.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears to be a straightforward implementation of classification metrics without suspicious or unusual patterns. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic detected. No external network or system interaction is observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a namedtuple for evaluation metrics. The main function computes true positives, false negatives, false positives, and derived metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score using element-wise operations on numpy arrays. All operations are standard mathematical computations for classification evaluation. No obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or suspicious constructs are present. The function operates solely on data provided via parameters, with no external or hidden side effects.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard evaluation metric calculations for binary classification without any signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a typical utility function used in machine learning model assessment.",
