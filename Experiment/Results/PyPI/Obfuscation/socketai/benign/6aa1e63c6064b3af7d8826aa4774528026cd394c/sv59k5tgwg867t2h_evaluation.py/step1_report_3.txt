  "purpose": "Calculate evaluation metrics (such as precision, recall, F1 score) based on true positive and predicted values.",
  "sources": "Input arrays VNpNOPECUOvCUEhuIvPiUbFfXGkCfOVF and YGUQylDkAjtzioyDSggCWsrabIJuYLnL, which are likely ground truth and predicted labels.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or untrusted data outputs present; computations are confined to array operations and metric calculations.",
  "flows": "Input data is processed via element-wise multiplication and summations, then used to compute various evaluation metrics.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears to perform standard evaluation metric calculations; no suspicious or unusual code, backdoors, or hardcoded secrets observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a namedtuple for evaluation metrics and a function that computes several metrics based on input arrays. It uses NumPy for array operations and calculations involving true positives, false positives, and false negatives. No external data, network operations, or code injection mechanisms are present. The function follows a typical pattern for metric calculation and does not contain obfuscated or malicious constructs. The overall structure is straightforward and matches common practices for evaluation metrics.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for computing evaluation metrics with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs legitimate calculations for model performance assessment. There are no anomalies or suspicious behaviors identified.",
