  "purpose": "Calculate evaluation metrics (e.g., precision, recall, F1 score) for binary classification predictions.",
  "sources": "Input parameters VNpNOPECUOvCUEhuIvPiUbFfXGkCfOVF and YGUQylDkAjtzioyDSggCWsrabIJuYLnL, which are NumPy integer arrays representing predictions and true labels.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data; calculations are based on inputs assumed to be arrays of predictions and labels.",
  "flows": "Input arrays are multiplied and summed to compute true positives, false negatives, false positives, then metrics are derived from these sums.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses obscure variable names, which is unusual but not inherently malicious; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard calculation of evaluation metrics (precision, recall, F1) for binary classification, using numpy operations. Variable naming is intentionally obscure, but logic appears consistent with standard metrics calculation. No suspicious data flows, no external data handling, no code injection, or network activity. Overall, the code is a straightforward implementation of evaluation metrics with obfuscated variable names, possibly for code concealment but not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a normal implementation of evaluation metrics calculation with obfuscated variable names, no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
