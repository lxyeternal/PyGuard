  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging, reading README.md, defining dependencies, scripts, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file; static strings; obfuscated variable assignments.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing, network operations, or data exfiltration points detected.",
  "flows": "No malicious data flow; code primarily loads static data and calls setup() with metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; unused variable 'JnCgFOMBXXcRJlBSimJUZLjwMtcdwZnf' assigned 'text/markdown'; suspicious key used as argument outside standard syntax.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py with obfuscation tactics such as nonsensical variable names and an unusual key-value pair. The key 'JnCgFOMBXXcRJlBSimJUZLjwMtcdwZnf' assigned 'text/markdown' appears invalid as a keyword argument, indicating possible obfuscation or corruption. No malicious code, network activity, or data leaks are present. The obfuscation may be benign or an attempt to conceal malicious intent, but no evidence supports active malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration with obfuscation techniques. No malware or malicious activity is detected. The anomalies suggest obfuscation or potential code tampering, warranting cautious review but not indicating active threats.",
