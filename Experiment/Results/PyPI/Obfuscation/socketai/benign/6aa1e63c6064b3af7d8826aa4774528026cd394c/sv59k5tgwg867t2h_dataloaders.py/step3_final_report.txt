{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom PyTorch Dataset classes for loading and processing sequence data, primarily from files, with methods for batching and tensor conversion. It appears to be designed for machine learning data pipelines.",
  "sources": "File reading operations, including splitting filenames and reading sequence data from text files.",
  "sinks": "Data is processed into numpy arrays and torch tensors; no network connections or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file input into internal data structures, then into numpy arrays and tensors for model consumption.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of variable and method names, presence of placeholder methods raising NotImplementedError, but no active malicious code or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data loading and batching for ML workflows, with obfuscated identifiers that may serve to conceal intent. No network activity, system modifications, or malicious payloads are detected. Placeholder methods suggest incomplete implementation but do not indicate malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical data processing module with superficial obfuscation and incomplete methods, but no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. Malware score is 0, obfuscation is moderate to high (around 0.6), and overall security risk is low (around 0.2).",
  "confidence": 0.9,
