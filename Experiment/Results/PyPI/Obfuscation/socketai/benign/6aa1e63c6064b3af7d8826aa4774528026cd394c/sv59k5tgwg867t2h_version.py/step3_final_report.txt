{
  "purpose": "Assigns a version string to an obfuscated variable name, likely for version tracking or placeholder purposes.",
  "sources": "No external inputs, outputs, network calls, or data reads; only a static assignment.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or external communications observed.",
  "flows": "Single source (hardcoded string) to variable; no external data flow or malicious control flow.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable name; version string indicates a development build ('-dev').",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to an obfuscated variable name. No malicious code, network activity, or data manipulation is present. The obfuscation appears intentional but does not imply malicious intent. The version string suggests a development version, common in testing or pre-release stages. Malware score is 0, security risk is minimal (0.1), and confidence is high (0.9). The obfuscation score reflects the variable name's obscurity but is not indicative of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving likely as a placeholder or version indicator. No malicious activity or security risk is evident. Obfuscation alone does not constitute malicious intent, and the code does not pose a threat.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.4,
