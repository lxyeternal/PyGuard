  "anomalies": "Use of a non-standard variable name that appears obfuscated, but no malicious activity is evident",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a string '1.1.0-dev' to a variable named 'LicGqeYKpaiHONvuJcLiOqjmzuROjBqa'. The variable name appears obfuscated or generated, which could be suspicious, but there are no other signs of malicious behavior, such as network calls, file operations, or code execution. The string itself indicates a version identifier, typical for software versioning, and contains no executable code or malicious content.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple variable assignment of a version string with an obfuscated variable name. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior is detected in this snippet.",
