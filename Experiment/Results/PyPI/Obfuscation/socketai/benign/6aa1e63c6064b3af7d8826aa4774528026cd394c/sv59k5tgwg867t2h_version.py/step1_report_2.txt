  "purpose": "Assign a version string to a variable, likely for package versioning",
  "sources": "Assignment of string to variable 'LicGqeYKpaiHONvuJcLiOqjmzuROjBqa'",
  "sinks": "Variable assignment, no untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; static assignment",
  "anomalies": "Variable name appears random and obfuscated, but no malicious activity detected; no code execution, network, or data leaks present",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string '1.1.0-dev' to a variable with an obfuscated name. There are no inputs, no processing, and no external interactions. The variable name is unusual but not inherently malicious. The string value is a standard development version indicator. No suspicious behaviors such as network calls, file manipulations, or data exfiltration are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple variable assignment with an obfuscated variable name. No malicious intent or security risks are detected.",
