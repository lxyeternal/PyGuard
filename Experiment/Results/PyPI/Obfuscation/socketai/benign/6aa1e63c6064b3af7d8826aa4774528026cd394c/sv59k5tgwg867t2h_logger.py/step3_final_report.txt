  "purpose": "Configure logging with a specific format string and dynamic log level based on environment variable.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'ATTACUT_LOG_LEVEL' for log level; format string for logging timestamp.",
  "sinks": "Logging output where timestamp and log level are recorded.",
  "flows": "Environment variable read -> logging configuration -> logger retrieval.",
  "anomalies": "Malformed or obfuscated date format string ('NtsKJryvLxLfDUqCdflBTqcSYokmlQOp') instead of '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'; suspicious variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up logging with a format string that contains a malformed date format, likely a typo or obfuscation. Variable names are nonsensical, which may suggest obfuscation but do not execute malicious code. No network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration is present. The environment variable controls log level dynamically, which is standard. The malformed date string could impair logging timestamp formatting but does not introduce security vulnerabilities. Scores: malware=0 (no malicious activity), obfuscated=0.6 (due to variable naming and formatting anomalies), risk=0.2 (minor formatting issues). Overall, the code is benign but suffers from formatting typos and obfuscation, which could affect operational correctness but not security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign logging setup with obfuscation and a formatting typo. No malicious activity is detected. The main concern is the malformed date format string, which may impair logging but does not pose a security threat. Obfuscation is likely intentional but not malicious.",
