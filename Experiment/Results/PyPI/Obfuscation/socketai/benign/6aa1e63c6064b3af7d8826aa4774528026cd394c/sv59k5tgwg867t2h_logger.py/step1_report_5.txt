  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names, incorrect format string parameter name 'NtsKJryvLxLfDUqCdflBTqcSYokmlQOp' instead of 'datefmt'",
  "analysis": "The code configures the logging module with a specific format and a log level determined by an environment variable. The variable names are obfuscated but do not indicate malicious intent. The format string contains a typo ('NtsKJryvLxLfDUqCdflBTqcSYokmlQOp' instead of the correct 'datefmt'), which might cause the logging configuration to fail or behave unexpectedly. The function KQduyXSsfzZREykrkVmIdUmxPKQpUJnx simply returns a logger instance. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code. The obfuscation appears to be an attempt to hide the purpose rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily performs standard logging setup with obfuscated variable names and a typo in the configuration parameter. No malicious behavior is evident; the obfuscation may be for code hiding or stylistic reasons. The main risk is that the logging configuration may not work as intended due to the typo.",
