  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names, potential misspelling in format string ('NtsKJryvLxLfDUqCdflBTqcSYokmlQOp') and inconsistent formatting in logging setup",
  "analysis": "The code sets up logging with a specified format and attempts to customize the log timestamp format, but the format string contains a suspiciously misspelled placeholder. The environment variable for log level is retrieved and used to set the log level dynamically. The function creates and returns a logger instance with a provided name. No malicious behaviors or malicious data flows are evident. The unusual variable names and formatting inconsistencies are suspicious but do not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code appears to be benign but with some obfuscated or suspicious naming conventions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily for logging setup with some irregular variable names and formatting issues. No evidence of malicious behavior or malware is present. It appears to be a standard logging configuration, though somewhat obfuscated or poorly formatted.",
