  "conclusion": "Most code snippets are benign with low security risks, except report 2, which exhibits red flags warranting cautious review. The scores in the original reports are reasonable; minor adjustments could increase the malware and risk scores for report 2 to better reflect the observed suspicious patterns. Overall, the supply chain security posture appears acceptable with targeted scrutiny of report 2 recommended."
