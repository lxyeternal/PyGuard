{
  "purpose": "The code appears to implement a simple utility function, potentially for data processing or computation.",
  "sources": "Input data may be read from function arguments, environment variables, or external files if present; however, the provided code does not explicitly show data input sources.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include console output via print statements, file writing, or network calls if present, but none are explicitly visible in the code provided.",
  "flows": "Data flow from input sources to processing functions, but specific source-to-sink pathways cannot be determined without additional context.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code patterns detected. The code structure is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and simple, with no use of obfuscated patterns, dynamic execution, or suspicious constructs. It does not contain hardcoded secrets or network activity. The absence of input validation or external data sources reduces risk, but also indicates limited functionality. No unusual behavior or malicious intent is evident.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with no signs of sabotage, malware, or supply chain attacks.",
