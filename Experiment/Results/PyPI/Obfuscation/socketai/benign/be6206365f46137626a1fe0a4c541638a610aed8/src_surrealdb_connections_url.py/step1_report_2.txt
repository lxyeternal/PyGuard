{
  "purpose": "The code appears to parse URLs and categorize schemes using an enum, possibly for network-related functionality.",
  "sources": "Input URL string passed to the constructor of FFNXkWYJZFwLcoLygHvrygJdFBRtKBQN class.",
  "sinks": "URL parsing and property assignment; no direct data output or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "Input URL string -> replace '/rpc' -> parse URL -> assign scheme, hostname, port to object properties.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names, no comments, and the replacement of '/rpc' may indicate an attempt to obscure intent. No hardcoded secrets found.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an Enum for scheme types, then a class that initializes with a URL string. It strips '/rpc' from the URL, parses the URL, and assigns scheme, hostname, and port to object attributes. The scheme is mapped through the enum, which may limit or validate acceptable schemes. The obfuscation of names suggests an attempt to conceal the purpose, but no malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors is evident. No input/output beyond URL parsing is performed, and no suspicious logic or external interactions are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs URL parsing and scheme classification with obfuscated naming but does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. Its primary function seems to be URL handling, and there is no evidence of malware or malicious intent.",
