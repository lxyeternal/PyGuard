  "conclusion": "The code is a benign URL parsing utility with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious activity or payloads. The removal of '/rpc' is not inherently malicious but should be considered in a broader context. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score should be set to 0."
