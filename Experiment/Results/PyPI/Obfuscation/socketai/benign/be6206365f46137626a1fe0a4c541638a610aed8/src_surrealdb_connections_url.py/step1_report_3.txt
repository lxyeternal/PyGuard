  "purpose": "The code appears to parse and process URLs, extracting and normalizing certain components such as scheme, hostname, and port.",
  "sources": "Input URL string provided to the FFNXkWYJZFwLcoLygHvrygJdFBRtKBQN class constructor.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; the code processes data in memory without writing to external systems or files.",
  "flows": "Input URL string -> replace '/rpc' -> urlparse -> extract scheme, hostname, port -> assign to object attributes.",
  "anomalies": "The use of a random class name and obfuscated enumeration names suggests an attempt at hiding intent; no clear malicious activity observed. The code replaces '/rpc' in the URL, which could be used to modify URL paths in a way that conceals true endpoints, but on its own this is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an enumeration with URL schemes, some of which are typical (http, https) and others less common (ws, wss, mem). The main class processes a URL string by removing '/rpc' from it, then parsing the URL to extract scheme, hostname, and port. The scheme is mapped through the enumeration, which could potentially be used to normalize or validate URL schemes. The obfuscation and renaming of classes and variables suggest an attempt to hide intent, but the functionality itself is straightforward and does not involve any network connections, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads. No use of untrusted input beyond initial URL string, and no evidence of malicious behavior or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily for parsing and normalizing URLs with some obfuscation; no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. The obfuscation might be suspicious, but the core logic appears benign.",
