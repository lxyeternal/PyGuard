{
  "purpose": "The code defines an Enum for URL schemes and a class that processes a URL string by removing '/rpc' and parsing its components (scheme, hostname, port). It appears to serve as a URL utility or parser.",
  "sources": "The input URL string provided to the class constructor.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain explicit sinks; it only processes and stores URL components without transmitting or executing data.",
  "flows": "The URL string is modified by removing '/rpc', then parsed into scheme, hostname, and port, which are stored as attributes.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class and variable names; removal of '/rpc' from URLs could be suspicious if used maliciously, but no malicious activity is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code performs URL parsing with scheme validation via an Enum, and obfuscated naming suggests an attempt to hide intent. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. The removal of '/rpc' could be part of URL manipulation, but on its own, it is benign. The obfuscation is superficial and does not indicate malicious behavior. Scores assigned in the reports overstate the risk; malware should be 0, as no malicious activity is demonstrated. The obfuscation score is justified due to naming, and the security risk is low given the benign functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign URL parsing utility with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious activity or payloads. The removal of '/rpc' is not inherently malicious but should be considered in a broader context. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score should be set to 0.",
