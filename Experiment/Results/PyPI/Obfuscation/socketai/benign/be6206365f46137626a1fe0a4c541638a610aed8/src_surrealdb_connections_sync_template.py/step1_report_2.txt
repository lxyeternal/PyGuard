{
  "purpose": "This code defines an abstract base class for database operations with method signatures that are intended to be implemented in subclasses.",
  "sources": "The code does not explicitly read input or external data sources; it primarily defines method signatures.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data leaks are evident; the methods raise NotImplementedError and serve as interfaces.",
  "flows": "There are no active data flows; the code only defines method signatures without implementation.",
  "anomalies": "Methods raise NotImplementedError with message strings containing 'not implemented for: {self}', but do not perform any suspicious actions. No hardcoded credentials or unusual code patterns are present. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution is evident. The import of 'surrealdb' types might suggest intended database interaction but lacks concrete logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely abstract, serving as a template or interface for database interactions. It contains no executable logic, data processing, or external interactions. All methods are placeholders raising NotImplementedError, indicating that actual malicious behavior or security risks cannot be inferred from this skeleton. The import statements reference specific data types which suggest usage in a database context, but no real operations are performed. There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code snippets. The code’s structure and content are typical of interface definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard abstract class defining method signatures for database operations. It does not contain any active or malicious code, and there are no evident security risks or malicious behaviors. It appears to be a legitimate interface template with no malicious intent.",
