{
  "purpose": "This code defines an abstract base class with numerous method stubs for database operations and authentication, likely intended for subclass implementation.",
  "sources": "No explicit sources of untrusted input; the class contains method signatures with parameters that could accept untrusted data (e.g., strings, dicts, UUIDs).",
  "sinks": "Method signatures suggest potential data handling points, but no concrete sinks such as network communication, file access, or data exfiltration are implemented here.",
  "flows": "No actual data flow occurs in this abstract class; flow would depend on subclass implementations. No code execution or data processing present.",
  "anomalies": "All methods raise NotImplementedError with descriptive messages; class contains no executable logic, only method signatures. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious constructs are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code serves as an interface or abstract base class with multiple unimplemented database and authentication method signatures. There is no runtime or operational code, no data processing, and no network interactions. It appears designed for extension rather than execution. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or security risks are evident within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a non-executable interface definition with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is structured for subclass implementation of database and authentication operations, with no evidence of sabotage or malware behavior.",
