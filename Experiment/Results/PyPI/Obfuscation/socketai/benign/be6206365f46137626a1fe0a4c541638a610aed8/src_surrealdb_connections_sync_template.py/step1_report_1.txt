{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for database-like operations with unimplemented methods, likely intended for subclasses to implement specific behavior.",
  "sources": "No input sources; all methods are stubs that raise NotImplementedError. The class imports several modules but does not use them internally.",
  "sinks": "No data flows to external systems, network, or storage within this code snippet. No untrusted data handling or output is present.",
  "flows": "No active data flow as all methods are unimplemented and raise exceptions. No source-to-sink paths are evident.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of numerous method stubs with placeholder error messages; no concrete logic or data processing. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are observable.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with many unimplemented methods, each raising NotImplementedError with descriptive messages. There is no evidence of malicious code, data leakage, or security vulnerabilities. The imports are unused and do not contribute to any malicious activity. The structure suggests it is intended as a base class for database interaction, possibly in a larger codebase. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are detectable within this isolated code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign abstract class template designed for subclass implementation. No malicious intent, suspicious activity, or security risks are present. It does not process or leak data, nor does it interact with external systems directly.",
