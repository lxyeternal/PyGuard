  "purpose": "The code provides factory functions and classes to initialize and return different connection objects based on URL schemes for SurrealDB, handling HTTP and WebSocket protocols.",
  "sources": "URL parameters passed to functions, particularly the 'url' argument in functions like SHOXIkSZKHsyOgbGwdRzkTJwedQUceOS and wJCyurwsLZkjPogpFWqpGUTWTlUvuoUS.",
  "sinks": "Instantiation of connection classes (TplbLfNhUJgDEaMNYENHiMpoXWVCUQbb, cTmOzZLcBhDgCyKkLgGGiLOefAXaTKar, VPbutAdXawkzbLzoCTZyVPfvZuBVgRbv, rrMkgcdVFpZPfrbGzPZUawFRRErmKaEP) which may involve network communication or system resource access.",
  "flows": "URL input -> parsing and scheme checking -> instantiation of specific connection classes based on scheme -> return of connection object.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obscured class and function names; no apparent hardcoded credentials or secrets; standard URL scheme handling. No malicious backdoors, data leaks, or suspicious code behavior detected. Exception messages reference the 'url' variable which is not directly accessible in some functions, but that appears to be a minor oversight rather than malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines factory classes to initialize connection objects based on URL schemes ('http', 'ws'). It validates URL schemes and raises errors for unsupported protocols. Functions handle URL parsing via an external class FFNXkWYJZFwLcoLygHvrygJdFBRtKBQN, which appears to parse schemes. There are no evident malicious behaviors such as network data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The code is obfuscated only in the sense of naming conventions and does not perform any suspicious operations. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are visible. The overall structure indicates legitimate connection factory functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard factory implementation for network connection objects based on URL schemes, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The obscurity of class and function names seems to be for obfuscation or naming conventions rather than malicious purposes. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident in this code fragment.",
