  "purpose": "The code defines classes and functions for initializing and selecting specific connection types based on URL schemes for SurrealDB, supporting both HTTP and WebSocket protocols.",
  "sources": "Input URL parameters passed to the class constructors or functions; URL parsing via FFNXkWYJZFwLcoLygHvrygJdFBRtKBQN.",
  "sinks": "Instantiation of connection objects (TplbLfNhUJgDEaMNYENHiMpoXWVCUQbb, cTmOzZLcBhDgCyKkLgGGiLOefAXaTKar, VPbutAdXawkzbLzoCTZyVPfvZuBVgRbv, rrMkgcdVFpZPfrbGzPZUawFRRErmKaEP) which may perform network operations.",
  "flows": "Input URL -> URL parsing and scheme evaluation -> Connection object instantiation based on scheme.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; functions primarily perform URL validation and object instantiation. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes connection objects based on URL schemes, with URL parsing and validation. It raises errors for missing URLs or unsupported protocols. Usage of class constructors and URL scheme checks is straightforward. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are evident within this snippet. The functions strictly handle URL validation and object creation, with no evidence of malicious payloads or hidden functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a standard URL handler for connection setup, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It performs expected URL validation and object instantiation based on protocol schemes without any suspicious activity.",
