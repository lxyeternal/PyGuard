  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class with obfuscated class and variable names, storing and returning a message.",
  "sources": "Initialization parameter and class attribute storing the message.",
  "sinks": "Return of message in __str__ method; no external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input parameter -> class attribute -> __str__ method -> output message.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names; no malicious code or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward custom exception class with obfuscated identifiers. It does not perform any network activity, data leaks, or malicious operations. The obfuscation appears superficial, primarily in naming, and does not indicate malicious intent. The class's functionality is benign, serving as a container for an error message. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, with high obfuscation scores justified by naming but no actual malicious behavior. Malware scores are appropriately zero, and security risk scores are low, reflecting minimal threat. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions confirm its benign status.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated custom exception class with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation is superficial and does not elevate the security risk. All assessments are consistent with this analysis.",
