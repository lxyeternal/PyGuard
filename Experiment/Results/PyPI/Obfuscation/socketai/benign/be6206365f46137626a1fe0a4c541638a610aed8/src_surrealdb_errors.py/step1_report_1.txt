  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class with an initialized message.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources; the code only defines a class.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points; class only defines behavior.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; class is self-contained.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable and class naming with obfuscated-looking identifiers; no actual malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a custom exception class inheriting from Exception. It initializes with a message parameter and overrides __str__ to return that message. Variable names are obfuscated, but no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks are present. There are no hardcoded credentials, no suspicious API calls, and no malicious logic. The code appears to be benign and intended for standard exception handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign class definition for a custom exception with obfuscated variable names. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
