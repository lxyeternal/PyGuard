  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class that stores an error message or data",
  "sources": "No input or external data reading observed",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data output or external calls observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the class only stores and returns a message",
  "anomalies": "Class name appears obfuscated, but this alone is not suspicious; code structure is straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class with an obfuscated name. It initializes with a parameter and stores it as an attribute. The __str__ method returns this attribute. There are no external data sources, no network calls, or suspicious logic present. The obfuscation could be an attempt to hide intent, but on its own, it does not indicate malicious behavior. The code is simple and appears to serve as a utility for error handling.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple custom exception class with obfuscated naming. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security risks in this code fragment.",
