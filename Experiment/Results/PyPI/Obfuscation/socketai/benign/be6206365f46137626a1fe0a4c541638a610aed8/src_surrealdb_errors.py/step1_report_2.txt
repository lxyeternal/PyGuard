  "purpose": "Custom exception class definition for error handling",
  "sources": "No external data sources; only internal class and method definitions",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external communications present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; class and method only handle internal data",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, but no suspicious code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious functions",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class with obfuscated variable names. It includes an __init__ method that assigns a parameter to an instance variable and a __str__ method that returns this variable. There are no external data inputs, network operations, or security-sensitive actions. The obfuscation seems to be just a naming choice rather than malicious intent. Overall, the code appears to be a simple, non-malicious class definition with no malicious behaviors or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, obfuscated custom exception class with no malicious intent or security issues. It does not perform any external communications, data leaks, or harmful operations.",
