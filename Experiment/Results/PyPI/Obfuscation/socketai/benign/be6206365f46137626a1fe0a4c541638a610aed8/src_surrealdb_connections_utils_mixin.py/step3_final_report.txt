  "purpose": "Validation functions checking for 'error' and 'result' keys in response dictionaries.",
  "sources": "Input dictionaries passed as arguments to the static methods.",
  "sinks": "Exception messages referencing 'response' variable, which is undefined.",
  "flows": "Input data -> validation checks -> exception messages referencing 'response' (undefined).",
  "anomalies": "Use of undefined variable 'response' in exception messages; obfuscated class and method names.",
  "analysis": "The code performs simple validation on input dictionaries, raising exceptions if 'error' is present or 'result' is missing. Both methods reference 'response' in exception messages without defining or passing it, indicating a bug or incomplete code. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are evident. Obfuscated naming suggests an attempt to conceal, but no malicious behavior is apparent. The undefined 'response' is a bug that would cause runtime errors but does not imply malicious intent. The obfuscation and bug are the main anomalies; no malware or security threats are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign validation logic with obfuscation and a bug involving an undefined variable. There is no evidence of malicious activity or malware. The obfuscation may be intentional but does not indicate malicious intent. The primary concern is the bug, which should be fixed to prevent runtime errors, but it does not elevate security risk.",
