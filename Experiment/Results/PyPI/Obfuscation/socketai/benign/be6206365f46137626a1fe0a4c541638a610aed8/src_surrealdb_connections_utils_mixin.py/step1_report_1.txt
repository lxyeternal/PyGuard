{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be utility functions for validating responses from some process, checking for errors or missing results.",
  "sources": "Input data passed via the dictionaries 'lImCuUCojbEJqbFFcnzESAcioLRYpQxN' in both functions.",
  "sinks": "Exception raising with formatted messages that include 'response' variable; however, 'response' is not defined within these functions.",
  "flows": "Input dictionary → error/result check → potential exception (using undefined 'response')",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'response' variable without definition; code structure suggests possible oversight or placeholder code, but no malicious activity evident.",
  "analysis": "The functions perform straightforward validation checks on input dictionaries, raising exceptions if expected keys are missing or errors are present. The variable 'response' is used in exception messages but is not defined or passed as an argument, which indicates a likely bug or incomplete implementation rather than malicious intent. No suspicious data handling, external network activity, or obfuscated code are present. The code does not perform any harmful actions or data leaks.\n\nOverall, this code appears to be benign validation logic with a probable bug involving an undefined variable.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple validation functions with no malicious intent. The use of an undefined variable 'response' suggests incomplete or incorrect code rather than malicious behavior. No security risks or malware are evident.",
