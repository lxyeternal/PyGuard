      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, URL-driven connection factory for SurrealDB, with obfuscated but benign class names. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is moderate (around 0.2-0.3), and overall security risk is low (~0.2). The code appears safe for use."

The obfuscation may be intentional but does not indicate malicious intent. The primary concern is the bug, which should be fixed to prevent runtime errors, but it does not elevate security risk."

      "conclusion": "The code is a non-implemented interface with obfuscated names, serving as a scaffold for database interactions. There is no evidence of malware or malicious intent. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not confirm malicious activity. The security assessment indicates a low risk profile, primarily due to the lack of active code or data flow."

      "obfuscated": 0.75,
      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a sophisticated, obfuscated WebSocket client for database interactions. Despite the suspicious obfuscation and complex async patterns, there is no direct evidence of malicious activity such as data theft, backdoors, or sabotage. The high obfuscation scores are justified, but the malware and risk scores should remain low to moderate unless further external analysis reveals hidden malicious components. Caution is advised, and further investigation into external dependencies and runtime behavior is recommended before trusting or deploying this code in security-critical contexts."

      "confidence": 0.85,
      "conclusion": "Most code snippets are benign with low security risks, except report 2, which exhibits red flags warranting cautious review. The scores in the original reports are reasonable; minor adjustments could increase the malware and risk scores for report 2 to better reflect the observed suspicious patterns. Overall, the supply chain security posture appears acceptable with targeted scrutiny of report 2 recommended."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-implemented async client for SurrealDB with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The obfuscation in module names is minimal and not suspicious in context. The supply chain security risk is low, and the malware score is 0."

The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the low risk score reflects the typical use case with potential for misuse but no inherent malicious features."

The removal of '/rpc' is not inherently malicious but should be considered in a broader context. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score should be set to 0."
