  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose:** Correctly identifies that the code is an interface with obfuscated names, no implementation, and no malicious logic.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** No data sources, sinks, or flows; all methods raise NotImplementedError.\n- **Anomalies:** Obfuscated names noted, but not inherently malicious.\n- **Analysis:** Accurate; no evidence of malware or security risks.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid; no malicious activity, just obfuscation.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - Security Risk: 0.2 (some concern over obfuscation, but minimal)  \n  - Confidence: 0.8 (reasonable)\n\n**Verdict:** Well justified. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose:** Correctly states that it's an abstract class/interface for database operations.\n- **Analysis:** No executable logic, no data handling, no malicious code.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - Security Risk: 0.1 (very low, mainly due to obfuscation)  \n  - Confidence: 0.9 (high confidence)\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose:** Same as above—interface for database operations.\n- **Analysis:** No logic, no data flow, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - Security Risk: 0 (no apparent risk)  \n  - Confidence: 1 (full confidence)\n\n**Verdict:** Correct. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar to previous, defining an abstract class for database/auth.\n- **Analysis:** No actual implementation, no malicious behavior, just obfuscated names.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - Security Risk: 0.2 (some caution due to obfuscation)  \n  - Confidence: 0.8\n\n**Verdict:** Sound reasoning. No adjustments.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose:** Same as above—interface with no logic.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity, just obfuscation.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - Security Risk: 0.2 (some concern over obfuscation)  \n  - Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Verdict:** Valid. No changes.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** Scores are high (around 0.6–0.8), which is justified given the obscure class/method names.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly elevated (0.1–0.2), primarily due to obfuscation, which could hide malicious intent but isn't evidence itself.\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n  - The code is purely an interface with no executable logic or malicious payload.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.7  \n  - Names are intentionally obscure, which could be suspicious but not malicious.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2  \n  - Slight concern due to obfuscation; actual risk depends on implementation, which is absent here.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:**  \nThe reports are consistent and justified. The main concern is obfuscation, which warrants caution but not immediate suspicion of malware. Without concrete implementation or evidence of malicious activity, the scores are appropriate.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is a non-malicious, obfuscated interface for database operations.  \n- No changes to the scores are necessary based on the provided information.",
