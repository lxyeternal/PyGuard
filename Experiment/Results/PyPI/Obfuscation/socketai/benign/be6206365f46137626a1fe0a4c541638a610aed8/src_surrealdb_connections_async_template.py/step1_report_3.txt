{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract class interface for asynchronous database operations, including various query, update, insert, delete, and authentication methods.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard and third-party libraries (typing, uuid, asyncio, surrealdb), class definition, and method signatures with parameters and NotImplementedError raises.",
  "sinks": "Method calls raising NotImplementedError; no direct sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Method signatures suggest data flow from input parameters (e.g., strings, dicts, UUIDs) to method calls, but no actual implementation or data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "All methods raise NotImplementedError; no executable code, logic, or data processing. The class appears as a stub or interface.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely an abstract class with method definitions raising NotImplementedError. No executable logic, data handling, or external calls are present. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The extensive use of NotImplementedError suggests this is a template meant for subclassing, not an operational component. No hardcoded credentials, unsafe code, or obfuscated parts are evident. The imports are standard and do not indicate malicious intent. The structure aligns with a typical interface pattern.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a non-malicious, standard interface definition for asynchronous database interactions. There are no signs of malware, malicious code, or security risks in the provided fragment. It functions as a scaffold for future implementation, with no active data processing or external communication.",
