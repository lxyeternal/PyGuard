{
  "purpose": "Defines an abstract class with method signatures for database operations and authentication workflows, intended for subclass implementation.",
  "sources": "The code itself does not read input or data; it only declares method signatures with no actual data input handling.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no untrusted data is processed or outputted in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows occur here; this is an interface definition with unimplemented methods.",
  "anomalies": "Methods contain consistent placeholder 'raise NotImplementedError' statements; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes an interface with multiple asynchronous methods for database interactions and authentication, but contains no executable logic or data handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network communication, or code injection. The usage of complex method names and imported modules appears to serve an obfuscation attempt, but no active malicious code or hidden backdoors are present in this fragment. The structure is consistent with a pure interface definition intended for subclass implementation.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward abstract interface for database and authentication operations with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain any active or harmful code; it solely declares method signatures. No security issues or malware signals are detected based on this fragment.",
