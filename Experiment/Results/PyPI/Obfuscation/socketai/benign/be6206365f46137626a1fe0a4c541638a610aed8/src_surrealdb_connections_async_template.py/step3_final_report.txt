{
  "purpose": "This code defines an abstract interface class with multiple asynchronous method signatures related to database operations, all raising NotImplementedError.",
  "sources": "No data sources; the code contains only method signatures with no data input or external data reading.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no data is processed, stored, or transmitted within this code fragment.",
  "flows": "No data flow; as all methods are unimplemented, there are no source-to-sink data flows.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names, which could be suspicious but are not inherently malicious; no hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a purely declarative abstract class serving as an interface for database operations. It contains no executable logic, data handling, or external communication. The obfuscated naming may be intended to hide purpose but does not constitute malicious activity. The malware score is appropriately set to 0, reflecting the absence of malicious code. The obfuscation score is high (~0.7), justified by the intentionally obscure names. The overall security risk score is low (~0.2), as the code does not perform any active or risky operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a non-implemented interface with obfuscated names, serving as a scaffold for database interactions. There is no evidence of malware or malicious intent. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not confirm malicious activity. The security assessment indicates a low risk profile, primarily due to the lack of active code or data flow.",
