{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class for building a bidirectionally transformed string, allowing modifications, insertions, deletions, and regex-based replacements on a source string.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the imported modules, class methods, and input parameters such as the source string and regex patterns.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe operations include regex matching and replacement, which could be manipulated if malicious patterns or replacement strings are provided, but no external untrusted input is directly used in a dangerous context within this snippet.",
  "flows": "Input string and regex patterns (sources) flow through methods like replace, skip, discard, and insert, modifying the internal state of the builder, but there are no evident external data flows to network or files within this code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code appears to be a standard implementation of a string builder with transformations and regex operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with methods for string transformations, including skipping, inserting, discarding, and regex-based modifications. All operations are standard and well-documented. No external data is read or written insecurely. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious logic, and the code primarily serves as a utility for string transformations. The use of regex operations is typical for text processing. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a straightforward implementation of a bidirectional string transformation utility with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe based on this fragment alone.",
