  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging a Python project, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": [
    "The open() call reading 'README.rst' in function DNBxYpDjokvTVmTrcolQYmQPPRJqqCyc",
    "Assignment of package metadata such as name, version, classifiers, keywords, license, package_data, and dependencies",
    "No user input, environment variables, or network calls present"
  ],
  "sinks": [
    "No sinks that process untrusted data or external inputs",
    "The setup function and static assignments do not execute external commands or handle untrusted data"

  "flows": [
    "Reading 'README.rst' file as a static input during setup",
    "Static assignment of package metadata and dependencies",
    "No dynamic code execution or data flow from untrusted sources"

  "anomalies": [
    "Obfuscated variable names (e.g., IyLrpGnzqBlpgTHmRnqrHWnGKUaHFfgb, qASmApopSzIjgCuEeYNwMddtbcwruLhy, LZbxhKFsECtvBAxGKKPWpUyGUEZtImrb) which have no semantic meaning",
    "Presence of seemingly random variable names instead of descriptive identifiers",
    "No actual malicious or suspicious code activity detected"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of a setup script using setuptools, with one function to read a README file. The variable names are obfuscated and do not serve any clear purpose beyond the setup configuration. There are no network calls, environment variable manipulations, or dynamic code execution. The obfuscation appears to be an attempt to hide some intent but, in this case, seems unnecessary and superficial. All dependencies and data are statically defined, with no indication of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with obfuscated variable names. No malicious activity or supply chain attack vectors are present. The obfuscation is superficial and does not impact the functionality or security. Overall, the code appears to be safe.",
