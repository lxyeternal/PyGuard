  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a standard setup script with superficial obfuscation. No active malicious behavior or supply chain threats are evident. The current scores should be adjusted to reflect low malware risk (~0.05), moderate obfuscation (~0.6), and low overall security risk (~0.2)."
