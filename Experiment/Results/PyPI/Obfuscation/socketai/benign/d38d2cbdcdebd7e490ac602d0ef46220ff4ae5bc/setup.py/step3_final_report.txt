{
  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for package configuration, reading README file, with obfuscated variable names.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.rst' via a function; static package metadata; no external data or untrusted input.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling; no network or external command execution.",
  "flows": "Function reads file but is not invoked; no data flow leading to malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; unused function; no active malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with superficial obfuscation. No malicious payloads, network activity, or data exfiltration are present. Obfuscation appears to be for concealment but does not translate into malicious behavior. The function reading the README is defined but not called, which is suspicious but not harmful. The malware and security risk scores are overestimated; actual risk is minimal.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a standard setup script with superficial obfuscation. No active malicious behavior or supply chain threats are evident. The current scores should be adjusted to reflect low malware risk (~0.05), moderate obfuscation (~0.6), and low overall security risk (~0.2).",
