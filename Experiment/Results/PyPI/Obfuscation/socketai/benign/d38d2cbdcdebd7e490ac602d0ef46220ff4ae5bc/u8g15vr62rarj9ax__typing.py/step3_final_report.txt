  "purpose": "Type alias definitions for complex data structures and type hints, serving as structural annotations in a larger codebase.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only defines type aliases using the typing module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external data flows are present; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks, as the code contains only static type alias declarations.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names that hinder readability; no executable logic or data handling; purely declarative.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of type alias definitions with intentionally obscure variable names, serving as static annotations. No runtime data processing, network activity, or malicious behaviors are present. The obfuscation appears stylistic or for concealment but does not indicate malicious intent. The malware score is 0, consistent with the absence of malicious code. The obfuscated score (~0.75) reflects the naming style. The security risk score (~0.1) is low, given the static, non-executable nature. Overall, the code is benign, and the scores are appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only as type annotations with obfuscated variable names. No malware or malicious activity is present. The obfuscation may be stylistic but does not imply malicious intent. The current scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: ~0.75, risk: ~0.1) are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
