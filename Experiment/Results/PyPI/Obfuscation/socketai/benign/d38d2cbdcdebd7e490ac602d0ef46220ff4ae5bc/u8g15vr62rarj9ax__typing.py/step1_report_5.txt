{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define type aliases for various complex data types, likely used for type hinting in a larger program.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; only type aliases are defined.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing functions present; no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths; purely type alias definitions.",
  "anomalies": "The variable names are intentionally obfuscated, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No code logic, function calls, or data manipulations are present.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of type alias definitions with highly obfuscated variable names. There are no data inputs, outputs, or processing logic. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code execution are evident. The obfuscation appears to be solely in variable naming, not in code behavior or logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is limited to defining type aliases with intentionally obfuscated variable names. There is no malicious behavior or security risk detected based solely on these definitions.",
