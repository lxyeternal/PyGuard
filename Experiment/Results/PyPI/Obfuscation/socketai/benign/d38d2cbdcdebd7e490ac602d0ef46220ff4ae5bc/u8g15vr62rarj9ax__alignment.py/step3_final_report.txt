{
  "purpose": "The code implements a sequence alignment class with methods for creating, manipulating, and inferring alignments between two sequences, using algorithms like Needleman-Wunsch and Hirschberg.",
  "sources": "Input sequences (original and modified), alignment indices, and optional parameters such as cost functions.",
  "sinks": "No external data leaks, network activity, or file I/O; purely computational operations.",
  "flows": "Sequence data flows from input sequences into alignment methods, with internal computations mapping source indices to sinks like bounds and slices.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of well-known sequence alignment algorithms, with comprehensive docstrings and methods for identity, bounds, shifting, slicing, inference, and composition. No external data handling or side effects are present. The code structure is straightforward, readable, and aligns with typical bioinformatics or text processing utilities. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are identified, and the scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all justified as zero based on the code's content and behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard sequence alignment utility with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
