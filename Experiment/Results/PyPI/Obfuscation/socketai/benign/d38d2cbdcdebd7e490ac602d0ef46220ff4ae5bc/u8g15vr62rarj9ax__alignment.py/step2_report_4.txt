  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, the reasoning behind the scores, and consistency with the code's content.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report states the code is a standard implementation of sequence alignment with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — aligns with the analysis.\n- **Justification:** The reasoning is sound; no external data handling, no obfuscation, no malicious constructs.\n- **Conclusion:** The score seems appropriate; no changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the straightforward, well-structured implementation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent.\n- **Justification:** No external data, no suspicious patterns, standard algorithms.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are reasonable; no adjustments necessary.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, the code is a benign implementation of sequence alignment with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — matches the analysis.\n- **Justification:** No external data leaks, no obfuscation, no malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** The scores are justified and appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar conclusion—standard sequence alignment utility, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious code, no external data handling, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as others, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — aligns.\n- **Justification:** No external data, no malicious constructs, standard implementation.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Presence of issues:** None. All reports correctly identify the code as a standard, benign sequence alignment implementation.\n- **Errors or flaws in reasoning:** None observed. All reports are consistent and accurate.\n- **Scores:** All are 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n- **Potential risks:** None. The code is purely computational, with no external data leaks, network activity, or malicious behavior.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a straightforward, well-documented sequence alignment utility with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities evident from the provided snippets and descriptions.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent with the code's content. No adjustments are necessary. The code is safe, benign, and performs standard alignment operations.",
