{
  "purpose": "The code handles Unicode normalization, character categorization, string augmentation, and alignment heuristics to process text data reliably across different representations.",
  "sources": "Reads input strings, character attributes, and normalization forms; processes untrusted Unicode data.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; internal processing only, no data exfiltration or external I/O.",
  "flows": "Input strings are normalized and case-folded; augmented characters are aligned with original strings; no external data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; code is straightforward Unicode processing logic.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard Unicode normalization, categorization, and string alignment using well-known techniques. No malicious code, backdoors, or malicious data handling are present. The functions are descriptive and do not perform I/O or network operations. The absence of suspicious patterns or obfuscation indicates benign intent. The security risk remains minimal, primarily due to processing untrusted input, but no malicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate Unicode processing logic with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is set to 0, the obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting minimal inherent risk. The confidence in this assessment is high.",
