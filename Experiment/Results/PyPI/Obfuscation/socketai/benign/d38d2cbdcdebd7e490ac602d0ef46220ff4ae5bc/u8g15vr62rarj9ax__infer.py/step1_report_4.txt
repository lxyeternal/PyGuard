{
  "purpose": "Description and processing of Unicode characters with normalization, categorization, and alignment for text analysis or transformation.",
  "sources": "None explicitly present; the code appears to be documentation or pseudocode outlining Unicode handling procedures.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks such as file writing, network transmission, or system calls are evident.",
  "flows": "The code describes processing flows involving normalization, case folding, and alignment of Unicode characters but does not implement any executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code is primarily descriptive and lacks executable statements, input handling, or external data interactions. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a high-level outline detailing Unicode character properties, normalization, and string alignment techniques. It emphasizes Unicode normalization and case folding to reduce differences, but contains no executable logic, input/output operations, or data handling that could pose security risks. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious actions. The structure suggests documentation or pseudocode rather than active code, and therefore no security concerns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a descriptive outline related to Unicode text processing. It does not include executable code, data input/output, or any malicious logic. No security threats or malware are detected.",
