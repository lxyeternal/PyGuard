{
  "purpose": "This code provides documentation and class descriptions for text tokenization and processing functionalities, including Token, Tokenization, and various tokenizer classes.",
  "sources": "No input sources or data read operations are present; the code is purely descriptive/documentational.",
  "sinks": "There are no sink functions or operations that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects; the code does not handle untrusted input or output.",
  "flows": "There are no executable flows or data processing pathways; the code only contains class/method signatures and docstrings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present. The code appears to be a standard implementation of a tokenization API with detailed documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely descriptive, outlining classes and methods related to tokenization of text with no active logic or data handling. It includes classes like Token, Tokenization, and various tokenizer types, each with documented parameters and usage examples. There are no operations, external inputs, or outputs; it solely defines interfaces and behaviors for text processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard documentation and class definitions for a text tokenization library. It does not contain any executable code, input handling, or data flows that could be malicious. Therefore, it presents no security risks, malware, or obfuscation issues.",
