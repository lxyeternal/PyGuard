{
  "purpose": "The code consists solely of class and function documentation related to tokenization, with no executable logic or data processing.",
  "sources": "Input text provided to tokenization classes/methods; no external data sources or sinks.",
  "sinks": "No external data leaks or network communication; data flows are internal and limited to processing input text.",
  "flows": "Input text flows into tokenization functions/classes; no external sinks or data exfiltration points identified.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, secrets, or suspicious patterns; purely descriptive documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code is composed of class definitions and documentation strings for various tokenization methods, including regex-based, ICU, Unicode, and language-specific tokenizers. There are no active code segments, data handling, or external interactions. The structure is standard for API documentation, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The code does not perform any network operations, file modifications, or data exfiltration. Given the lack of executable logic and external data flows, the code poses no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is benign, purely documentation-oriented, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements. It presents no security concerns and is safe for use.",
