{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a set of classes and functions related to text tokenization, including token extraction, string slicing, and boundary detection for words, sentences, and characters, intended for natural language processing tasks.",
  "sources": "Input text provided to tokenization functions, including parameters like 'text' and 'bistr' objects.",
  "sinks": "Tokenization methods and functions process input data; no evident sinks that send data externally or write to system resources.",
  "flows": "Input text -> Tokenizer classes (RegexTokenizer, SplittingTokenizer, CharacterTokenizer, WordTokenizer, SentenceTokenizer) -> Tokens with start/end positions -> Mapped spans.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or unusual code behavior. The code is primarily straightforward class and method definitions for NLP tokenization tasks. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated constructs, or suspicious network activity are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines tokenization classes and methods for linguistic processing, including extraction, alignment, and boundary detection for text. It includes sample usage comments and standard regex-based tokenizers. No external data inputs, network calls, or file operations are observed. There are no indications of malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system manipulation. The code appears to be a standard NLP utility library with no malicious intent or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign NLP utility library focused on tokenization tasks. It contains no malicious or suspicious features, and no security risks are evident. It functions as intended for text processing without any malicious payload or behavior.",
