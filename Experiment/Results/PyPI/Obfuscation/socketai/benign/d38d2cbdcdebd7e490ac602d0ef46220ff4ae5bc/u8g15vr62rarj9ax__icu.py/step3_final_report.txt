  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Dynamic code execution points (eval, exec), hardcoded credentials, obfuscated variables, suspicious control flow, data input points.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, system modifications, network communications, execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Input sources (e.g., user input, environment variables) leading to dynamic execution or data handling points.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variable names, dynamic code execution without clear benign purpose, hardcoded secrets, suspicious control flow.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits minimal suspicious features in benign cases (Report 1, 3, 4), with low obfuscation and malware scores. In suspicious cases (Report 2, 5), dynamic execution, obfuscation, and hardcoded credentials are present, justifying higher scores. Slight adjustments to the security risk score for Report 5 reflect potential exploitation risks. Overall, the scores are consistent with the descriptions, with minor increases in risk metrics for ambiguous or risky constructs.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with low security risk; however, dynamic execution and obfuscation in some reports warrant cautious scoring. Adjustments to overall malware (~0.75), obfuscation (~0.7), and security risk (~0.4) are justified based on the evidence.",
