      "conclusion": "The script functions as a process wrapper with signal handling, with no evidence of malicious behavior. The primary security risk stems from unvalidated user input that could lead to command injection. Obfuscation raises suspicion but is not definitive of malicious intent. Overall, the code is benign but should be used with input validation to mitigate potential risks."
