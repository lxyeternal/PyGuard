  "conclusion": "The code appears primarily as a legitimate psychometric analysis tool with signs of obfuscation and incomplete code segments. There is no direct evidence of active malware or malicious payloads. The main security concern is potential exploitation via filename handling and external module import, which could be malicious if external factors are compromised. Overall, it is a high suspicion but not confirmed malicious code."
