{
  "purpose": "The code creates a sample DataFrame, writes it to CSV, then loads and tests data processing functions from an obfuscated module, verifying data integrity and calculations.",
  "sources": "Reading 'test_data.csv' created within the script; data is loaded via the obfuscated module.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; no network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "CSV data -> loaded into module object -> method calls and attribute checks; no external or malicious data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation of module and method names; no malicious code detected but suspicion due to obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a test suite for data processing, with obfuscated identifiers. No malicious activity, network activity, or system modifications are evident. Obfuscation raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. The tests verify data loading, statistical calculations, and data filtering, all consistent with benign data processing. The module's internal implementation is unknown, so absolute certainty is limited. The malware score is appropriately zero; obfuscation is high but not malicious; security risk is low. The scores are consistent with the absence of malicious behavior, and the code appears to be a standard testing setup.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code and analysis, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation is notable but not indicative of malicious intent. The current scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: ~0.7, risk: 0.2) are justified and should be maintained unless further evidence emerges.",
