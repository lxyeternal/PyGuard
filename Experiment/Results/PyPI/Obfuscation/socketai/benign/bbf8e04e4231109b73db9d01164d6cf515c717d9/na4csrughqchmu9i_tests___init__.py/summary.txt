  "obfuscated": 0.6,
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "conclusion": "The majority of the code appears benign, with no malicious activity detected. Report 5's obfuscation and dynamic features warrant cautious scoring, suggesting a moderate malware risk. Overall, the scoring aligns with the analysis, but an increased malware score for report 5 enhances accuracy in reflecting potential concealment risks."
