  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly provided; it appears to be a generic Python script possibly intended for system or data processing tasks.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from standard input, environment variables, and possibly from imported modules' functions or external resources.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or subprocess executions that could be used to exfiltrate data or execute arbitrary commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (user input, environment variables) through processing functions, possibly reaching output functions such as network sockets, file system writes, or command execution points.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials or secrets detected. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious imports, or unusual control flows. The code structure appears straightforward. No suspicious network or system calls are evident.",
  "analysis": "The script contains standard Python syntax with typical imports and function definitions. It does not exhibit obfuscation, unusual language features, or dynamic code execution. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or privilege escalation is apparent. The code's purpose remains ambiguous, but based on the visible content, there are no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code appears benign with no clear evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It seems to be a typical Python script without embedded malware or suspicious patterns.",
