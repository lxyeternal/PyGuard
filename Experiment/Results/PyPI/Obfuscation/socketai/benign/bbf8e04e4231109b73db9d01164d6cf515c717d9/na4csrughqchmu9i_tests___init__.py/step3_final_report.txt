  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code input points such as data reading functions, environment variable access, network connections, or dynamic code execution segments.",
  "sinks": "Sensitive operations like network transmission, file modification, or environment variable access that could lead to data leaks or system compromise.",
  "flows": "Data flow from sources (inputs) to sinks (outputs or sensitive operations), potentially involving obfuscation or dynamic code execution to conceal malicious intent.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, dynamic code execution, unusual variable naming, or suspicious import patterns.",
  "analysis": "Most reports indicate benign code with no suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malicious indicators, supported by high confidence scores and low malware/security risk scores. Report 5 notes obfuscation (0.7) and dynamic features, raising suspicion but lacking concrete malicious activity. The low malware score (0.2) in report 5 underestimates potential concealment. Given the evidence, a moderate malware score (around 0.4) and obfuscation (0.6-0.7) are more appropriate for report 5, reflecting the potential for malicious hiding. The other reports are consistent with safe code, with scores appropriately set to zero or low values.",
  "conclusion": "The majority of the code appears benign, with no malicious activity detected. Report 5's obfuscation and dynamic features warrant cautious scoring, suggesting a moderate malware risk. Overall, the scoring aligns with the analysis, but an increased malware score for report 5 enhances accuracy in reflecting potential concealment risks.",
