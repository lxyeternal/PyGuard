  "purpose": "Generate a detailed PDF report with statistical and item analysis for psychometric assessments.",
  "sources": "Dataframes containing statistical metrics and assessment data; external style sheets and configuration variables.",
  "sinks": "None evident; data is used internally for report generation without external output or network activity.",
  "flows": "Dataframes are processed to produce tables and paragraphs, which are assembled into a PDF document; no external untrusted data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names; placeholder variables like 'stats', 'num_students', 'num_questions' are undefined within the snippet, indicating incomplete code or external dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom Canvas class for page numbering and footer, then constructs a PDF report with multiple sections including title, author, assessment analysis, descriptive indicators, and item analysis tables. The obfuscation of class/method names and undefined variables suggest incomplete or proprietary code. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious commands are present. The report uses standard reportlab components and styling, with no suspicious logic or payloads. The obfuscation appears to be an attempt to conceal code details rather than malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscation: ~0.6-0.8, risk: 0.2) are consistent with the observed code and reasoning.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate report generation utility with significant obfuscation but no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain attack indicators. The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not elevate the security risk beyond a very low level. The incomplete variables suggest dependency on external data or larger code context, but nothing malicious is evident.",
