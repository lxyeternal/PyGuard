{
  "purpose": "The code performs static imports from local modules with obfuscated names and defines an __all__ list with clear identifiers, likely for API exposure.",
  "sources": "Imports from .analysis and .report modules with obfuscated symbol names.",
  "sinks": "No runtime data, network activity, or data leaks are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Import statements with obfuscated symbols; no data flow or execution beyond static import.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated import names that do not match the exposed __all__ identifiers, suggesting potential concealment.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of import statements with non-descriptive names and an __all__ declaration. The obfuscated import names could be benign or malicious; their presence alone warrants caution. No dynamic behavior, network activity, or data processing is evident. The inconsistency between imported symbols and exposed API identifiers raises suspicion that the symbols may be renamed or concealed. The low malware scores across reports align with the absence of direct malicious activity, but high obfuscation scores reflect suspicion. The overall risk remains moderate, primarily due to obfuscation, which warrants further investigation into the imported modules. The scores are consistent with the cautious assessment that obfuscation alone is not proof of malicious intent but should prompt additional review.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign in function but employs obfuscated import names, which is suspicious. No malicious activity is evident, but the obfuscation warrants further inspection of the imported modules to rule out concealment of malicious code.",
