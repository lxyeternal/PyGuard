  "purpose": "This code imports specific functions or classes from local modules and defines the public API for the package.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .analysis and .report",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data or external communication are present",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; imports are static and local",
  "anomalies": "Imported symbols have obfuscated or non-descriptive names (xvsgpvQQLMXpDagIJbSCBlZPSPcAwAWH, GYCWpAdmlOCUGvhuoNASPuCCOpRoTmUl), which is unusual and may indicate obfuscation or concealment",
  "analysis": "The code imports two modules with non-meaningful, obfuscated names, possibly to hide functionality. The __all__ list exposes 'AssessmentAnalysis' and 'generate_pdf_report', but these are not directly linked to the imported symbols, which might suggest intentional concealment. The code structure is minimal, with no runtime behaviors, network activity, or data handling. The obfuscated import names could be used to hide malicious code or avoid detection, but the code snippet alone does not contain executable logic or suspicious patterns beyond that.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple module interface with obfuscated import names, which could be suspicious. However, without further context or additional code, there is no definitive evidence of malicious behavior. The obfuscation may warrant closer inspection of the imported modules.",
