  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign data reading utility with obfuscated identifiers that could be used to conceal malicious behavior. There is no evidence of malicious activity in this snippet. The high obfuscation score is justified, but the malware score should remain low given the absence of malicious indicators. The overall security risk is low, but ongoing review of the imported module is recommended to ensure no hidden malicious code."
