{
  "purpose": "The code appears to initialize and configure a web scraping or automation tool, possibly to fetch or process web data.",
  "sources": "Reading URL strings, environment variables, or user inputs (if present), although none are explicitly visible in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Network requests, file operations, or subprocess calls that could send data externally or modify system state, if present.",
  "flows": "Data from sources (e.g., URLs or inputs) flows into network requests or file operations, potentially reaching sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of explicit hardcoded credentials or suspicious network domains; however, lack of context makes some behavior ambiguous. No obfuscated code detected. No malicious system calls or backdoors evident.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports modules and sets up configurations, with no visible data processing, network communication, or external data handling. No signs of malicious payloads, obfuscated logic, or suspicious patterns. Without further context or data, the code appears benign and standard in structure.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is straightforward, with no suspicious activities detected.",
