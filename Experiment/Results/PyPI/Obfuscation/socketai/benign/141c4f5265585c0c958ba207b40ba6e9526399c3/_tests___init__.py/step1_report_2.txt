{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script, possibly for data processing or utility functions, with no immediately obvious malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Reads data from variables, function parameters, or environment variables; no external input sources like files or network connections explicitly visible.",
  "sinks": "Uses standard output, variable assignments, or library functions; no apparent untrusted data sinks such as network transmissions or file modifications.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through functions to outputs or stored variables; no complex or suspicious data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious imports, or unusual code constructs identified; no obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, no suspicious comments or variable names.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard Python syntax and modules, with clear structure. No signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or cryptomining. The code does not include network activity, file system modifications, or sensitive data handling. The absence of obfuscation, backdoors, or hidden code paths further reduces suspicion. Overall, the code appears benign based on provided content.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code shows no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It seems to be a legitimate, non-malicious Python script with standard operations.",
