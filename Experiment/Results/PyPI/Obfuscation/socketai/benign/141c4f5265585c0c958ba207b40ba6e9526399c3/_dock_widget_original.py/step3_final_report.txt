{
  "purpose": "A napari plugin widget with a button that prints the number of layers and a filtering function that creates a Points layer based on gene property matching.",
  "sources": "Layer properties ('gene') and layer data (Points coordinates).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external communication; purely local data processing and UI interaction.",
  "flows": "Filtering function reads layer data and properties, then creates a new Points layer; button click triggers a print statement.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation in variable and function names, reducing code clarity but no malicious patterns or suspicious code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard UI and data filtering operations within napari. No network activity, file modifications, or malicious system commands are present. Obfuscation is significant but appears to be for concealment rather than malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or external data exfiltration are detected. The filtering logic is straightforward, operating on layer properties, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a typical napari plugin component for filtering points based on gene property. Obfuscation reduces readability but does not indicate malicious activity. No security risks or malware are evident.",
