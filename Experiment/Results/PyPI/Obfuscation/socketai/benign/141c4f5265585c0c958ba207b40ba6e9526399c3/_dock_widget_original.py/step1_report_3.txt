{
  "purpose": "Define a Napari plugin with a custom widget and a factory function to create points layers based on gene properties.",
  "sources": "Input source is the 'spot_map' Points layer property 'gene', and button click triggers a print statement.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no data is sent over the network, written to files, or executed in an unsafe manner.",
  "flows": "User interaction (button click) causes a print; the factory function filters points by gene property to create a new layer.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obscure variable names; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code; code appears intentionally obfuscated via naming, but no malicious activity evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a widget with a button that prints the number of layers when clicked. The factory filters points based on gene property matching a specified gene and creates a Points layer with the filtered data. No data leakage, external network calls, or malicious behavior is present. The obscure variable names suggest obfuscation, but they do not indicate malicious intent. The code uses standard Napari plugin patterns and safe Python constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate Napari plugin component with no signs of malicious behavior. The obfuscated variable names suggest intentional hiding but do not indicate malicious activity. No security risks detected.",
