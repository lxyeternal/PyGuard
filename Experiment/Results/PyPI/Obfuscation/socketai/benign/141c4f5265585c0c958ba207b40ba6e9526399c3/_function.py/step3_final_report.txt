  "purpose": "The code filters points based on a 'gene' property and creates a new napari Points layer with specified visual attributes.",
  "sources": "points.properties['gene'], points.IOnsTqOXTIijWtrcZABZjWpYKhBjNKaj (coordinate data)",
  "sinks": "None; no external data transmission or system manipulation detected",
  "flows": "Filtering of points by gene property → creation of new Points layer with filtered coordinates and visual properties",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names; no input validation or error handling; no suspicious code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward data filtering and visualization within napari. Obfuscated identifiers hinder readability but do not indicate malicious intent. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious system commands are present. The code's purpose is benign, and no security vulnerabilities are evident. The obfuscation is notable but not malicious, and the logic is typical for visualization plugins.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign data filtering and visualization utility with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious activity, data theft, or system compromise. The obfuscation may be stylistic or for brevity but does not elevate security risk.",
