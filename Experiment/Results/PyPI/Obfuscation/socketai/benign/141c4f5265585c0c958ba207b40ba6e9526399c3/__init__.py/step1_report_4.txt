  "purpose": "Import version information and modules from internal package components.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version string; import statements from internal modules.",
  "targets": "Imported modules and variables that may be used elsewhere in the package.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; mainly static imports and variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable name (QLNFRciyEgVVsCwRPAlxIrauqfnJoCzj) assigned to a version string; import of internal modules with obfuscated or non-descriptive names.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to an obfuscated variable name, which may be an attempt to hide the purpose. It imports two internal modules with complex, non-descriptive names, possibly indicating obfuscation or malicious intent. No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The import statements do not involve any dynamic or risky behavior. The variable name and module names are unusual but do not inherently indicate malicious activity. Overall, the code appears to be part of a larger, possibly obfuscated package but does not contain direct malicious behavior in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard import operations with obfuscated names, which could be part of an obfuscated or protected package but does not show clear malicious intent or security risks based on this fragment alone.",
