{
  "purpose": "This code initializes a version string and imports two internal modules with obfuscated names, likely part of a larger package.",
  "sources": "The version string assignment and the import statements from local modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not process external input or output data.",
  "flows": "The code sets a version variable and imports modules, with no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and module names, which can be used to conceal malicious intent or sensitive operations.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, performing a version assignment and importing internal modules with obfuscated identifiers. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted data is evident. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not directly indicate malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: low, obfuscation: high, risk: moderate) are consistent with the static analysis. Further review of the imported modules is recommended to confirm their benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet appears benign in isolation, with obfuscation being the primary concern. No evidence of malicious activity is present, but the obfuscation warrants further investigation of the imported modules to rule out concealed malicious code.",
