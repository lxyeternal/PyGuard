  "purpose": "Define a version string and import specific modules from the same package.",
  "sources": "The version string assignment; import statements from local modules.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or perform actions based on external input.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; only static imports and variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated-looking module names (e.g., YAezjEyhCTqLrnXXALluCiNoWaqJDLEn, MwLOfQcRBHYgKHQhFhxsmPdCwMtKaoJc) which may indicate obfuscation or concealment of malicious intent. The version string appears normal.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string to '0.0.8' and imports two modules from the current package, with obfuscated module names. No user input, network activity, or execution of dynamic code is present. The obfuscated module names could be used to hide malicious modules or behavior, but based solely on this snippet, there is no direct evidence of malicious activity. The code structure is minimal and typical for package initialization, but the obfuscated import names warrant caution.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard package version declaration and import statements, but the obfuscated module names raise suspicion of possible concealment. There is no direct malicious behavior detected, but the obfuscation warrants further review of the corresponding modules.",
