      "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, obfuscated data loader with no evidence of malicious activity. Obfuscation raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. The low malware score is appropriate, and the security risk score reflects caution due to lack of validation. The assessments in the reports are consistent and reasonable. Slightly increasing the malware score to 0.2 could better reflect the suspicion caused by obfuscation, but overall, the code appears benign."

There is no evidence of malicious activity in this snippet. The high obfuscation score is justified, but the malware score should remain low given the absence of malicious indicators. The overall security risk is low, but ongoing review of the imported module is recommended to ensure no hidden malicious code."
