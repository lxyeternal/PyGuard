{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging a Python project, defining dependencies and metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file, importing modules, defining dependency list, environment version check.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, no network activity, no code execution of untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Reading README -> defining dependencies -> environment check -> calling setup() with metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, but no malicious code, dynamic execution, or data leaks detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py with obfuscated variable names, which are unusual but not malicious. No code execution, network activity, or data leaks are present. Dependency constraints and environment checks are typical. The obfuscation may be for concealment but does not indicate malicious intent. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated ~0.75, risk=0.15) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with superficial obfuscation. No evidence of malware or malicious behavior is found. The obfuscation alone does not imply malicious intent, and the overall security risk is very low.",
