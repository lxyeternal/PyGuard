{
  "purpose": "The code is setting up a Python package using setuptools, including reading the README file and specifying dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file; importing sys to check Python version; defining dependency list; calling setup() with package metadata.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly writes or executes untrusted data; setup() is used for package configuration.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md (source) for package description; dependencies defined (no flow to untrusted source); setup() call consolidates inputs.",
  "anomalies": "The variable names are obfuscated (random strings), but this alone is not malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior observed. The code performs standard setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical package setup steps, including reading a README file and specifying dependencies based on Python version. Obfuscated variable names are unusual but not inherently malicious. There are no network connections, data leaks, or malicious actions. The code is a standard setup script with unusual variable names that could be considered suspicious but do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a normal setup script for a Python package, with obfuscated variable names but no malicious behavior detected. No security risks or malware are present based on the provided code.",
