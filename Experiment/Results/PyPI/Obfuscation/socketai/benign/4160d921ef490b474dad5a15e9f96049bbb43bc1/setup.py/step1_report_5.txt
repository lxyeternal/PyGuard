{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package, defining dependencies and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description; defining dependency list; obtaining system version info.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or dangerous functions observed.",
  "flows": "Reading file -> setting dependencies -> configuring setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, no clear malicious indicators, no use of eval or exec, no network or system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup operations: reading a README file, defining dependencies, and calling setup(). Variable names are intentionally obfuscated but do not influence execution maliciously. No user input is processed; no external data is fetched or sent; dependencies are typical for a web application. No suspicious logic, no hardcoded credentials, or potentially malicious code present. The use of obfuscated variable names might indicate an attempt to conceal intent but appears to be just obfuscation rather than malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with obfuscated variable names but no malicious intent or security issues detected. It poses no security threat and appears to be legitimate package configuration code.",
