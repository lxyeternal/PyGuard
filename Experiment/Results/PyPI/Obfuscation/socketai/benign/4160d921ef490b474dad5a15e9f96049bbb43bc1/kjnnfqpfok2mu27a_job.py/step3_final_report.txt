  "purpose": "Register handler functions into web.async_types and web.sync_types dictionaries for asynchronous and synchronous processing.",
  "sources": "Function definitions with __name__ attribute, used as keys in web module dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "No external data input, no data leaks, no network activity, no execution of external commands.",
  "flows": "Decorator functions receive a function object, store it in a dictionary keyed by __name__, then return the function.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function names that do not describe their purpose; no descriptive identifiers.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two decorators that register functions into specific dictionaries within the web module, based on their __name__. The function names are intentionally obfuscated, but the logic is straightforward and typical for web handler registration. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code does not process external inputs or perform any risky operations. The obfuscation of function names is a concern but not indicative of malicious intent in this context. The malware score is appropriately zero, and the security risk is minimal. The obfuscation score is moderate, reflecting the non-descriptive names, but does not imply malicious activity. Confidence in this assessment is high, given the simplicity and clarity of the code, and the absence of suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard pattern for registering web request handlers with obfuscated function names. There is no malicious activity or security vulnerability present. The obfuscation does not elevate the risk significantly. Overall, the code is safe and typical for its purpose.",
