{
  "purpose": "The code appears to register functions as asynchronous or synchronous handlers within a web framework.",
  "sources": "The code reads the function objects passed as arguments to the decorator functions.",
  "sinks": "The code stores functions in dictionaries ('async_types' and 'sync_types') within the 'web' module; no direct data leaks or security-sensitive actions are evident.",
  "flows": "Functions are passed to decorators, which then store them in 'web.async_types' or 'web.sync_types' by function name.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses non-descriptive, obfuscated function names and does not perform input validation or sanitization. The use of 'web' module attributes for storing functions is typical for route registration but warrants review. No code injection, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two decorators that register functions as asynchronous or synchronous handlers in the 'web' module. It relies on the function's __name__ attribute for registration. There are no apparent security risks such as code injection, data leakage, or malicious actions within this snippet. The obfuscated function names could hinder readability but are not inherently malicious. The code structure suggests standard route registration logic, with no external data sources or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is likely part of a web framework's routing mechanism, registering handler functions. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this fragment. The obfuscated function names may reduce code clarity but do not imply malicious intent.",
