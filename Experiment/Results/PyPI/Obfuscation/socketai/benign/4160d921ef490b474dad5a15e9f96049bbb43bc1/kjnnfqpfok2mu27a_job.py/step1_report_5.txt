{
  "purpose": "The code registers functions as asynchronous or synchronous handlers in a web framework.",
  "sources": "The code reads the input functions passed as arguments to the decorators.",
  "targets": "No direct data sinks or outputs; it modifies web's internal dictionaries.",
  "flows": "Input functions are stored in web.async_types or web.sync_types based on decorator usage.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; no suspicious or unusual code behavior is evident. No hardcoded credentials or malicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two decorators that register functions in web's internal dictionaries for async and sync handling. The functions are stored with their __name__ as keys. There is no user input handling, no external network communication, no data leakage, or malicious code. The code is straightforward and appears to be part of a web framework's routing or handler registration mechanism. There are no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple decorator implementation for registering handler functions within a web framework. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign and purposefully designed for function registration.",
