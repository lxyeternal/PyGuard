{
  "purpose": "This code appears to register functions as asynchronous or synchronous handlers within a web framework, likely for routing or callback registration.",
  "sources": "The code reads the function objects passed as arguments to the decorators.",
  "sinks": "The code modifies the 'web' module's 'async_types' and 'sync_types' dictionaries, which could influence web request handling.",
  "flows": "Function definitions receive 'func'; decorators add 'func' to 'web' module registries, establishing a source-to-sink flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual code structures are present. Usage of dynamic function registration is typical in web frameworks.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two decorators that register functions into the 'web' module's 'async_types' and 'sync_types' dictionaries. This pattern is common in web frameworks for registering route handlers or callbacks. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code's simplicity and straightforward registration mechanism suggest normal functionality, although it does rely on external functions being registered appropriately.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard decorator pattern for registering functions as web request handlers, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of a web application's routing setup.",
