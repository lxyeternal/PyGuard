  "purpose": "The code is a benign Python script performing standard data handling or setup tasks, with no malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "sources": "Input from environment variables, user input, or configuration files.",
  "sinks": "Potential data output, environment variable access, or network connections (if any), but none are malicious or insecure in this context.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (env vars, user input) to processing functions, with no suspicious or malicious sink interactions observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical benign script with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. All signals point to a low security risk profile. The confidence level is high (0.9), given the lack of suspicious patterns and the straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score should be 0. The overall assessment indicates a safe supply chain scenario.",
