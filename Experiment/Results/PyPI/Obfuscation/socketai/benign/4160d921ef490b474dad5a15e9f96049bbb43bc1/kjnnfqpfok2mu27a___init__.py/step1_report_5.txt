  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform a specific function or utility within a larger application, but the exact intent cannot be determined definitively from the provided snippet alone.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input functions, environment variables, or imported modules. Specific source points are not visible due to the absence of code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include data being sent over network connections, written to files, or executed via eval/exec functions. No explicit sinks are identified in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources or environment variables through processing functions to sinks such as network or file operations. Without concrete code, flow details cannot be precisely mapped.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are visible. The code structure appears standard, but the absence of actual code limits detailed analysis.",
  "analysis": "The analysis is limited by the lack of specific code content. No suspicious or malicious patterns can be confirmed without the code being provided. The code structure appears normal, with no evident malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of visible code content, there are no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears benign, but a more detailed review with actual code content is necessary to confirm this.",
