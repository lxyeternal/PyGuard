  "confidence": 0.85,
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates obfuscation and dynamic execution patterns that warrant cautious handling. Reports 3 and 4 show the highest suspicion, with adjusted malware scores of 0.6 to better reflect potential malicious behavior. Other reports are consistent with benign or low-risk code. Overall, the scoring aligns with the observed features, emphasizing the need for further runtime analysis for confirmation."
