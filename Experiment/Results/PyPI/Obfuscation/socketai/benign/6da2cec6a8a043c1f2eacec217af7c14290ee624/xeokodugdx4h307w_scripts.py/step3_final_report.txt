  "purpose": "The code automates deployment and management of Docker stacks and AWS resources, including credential generation and cloudformation template handling.",
  "sources": "Network requests (urllib, requests), file downloads (wget), environment variables, user inputs, and external API endpoints.",
  "sinks": "Shell commands execution, API calls, file system modifications, email sending, and system resource management.",
  "flows": "Input data from network/API/files flows into shell commands, credential handling, and API interactions, influencing system state and external resources.",
  "anomalies": "SSL verification disabled (`ssl._create_default_https_context = ssl._unverified_context`), hardcoded URLs and resource identifiers, obfuscated variable names, dynamic password generation with weak entropy, execution of shell commands without explicit validation.",
  "analysis": "The script performs infrastructure deployment and credential management with high automation. It uses insecure practices such as SSL bypass and executing shell commands with unvalidated inputs. Variable names are obfuscated, making understanding difficult. No explicit malicious payloads or exfiltration activities are evident, but the code's capabilities could be exploited if inputs are malicious or environment is compromised.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits insecure practices and high automation potential, posing significant security risks. No direct malware or malicious payloads are detected, but the insecure handling and obfuscation justify a high security risk score. The malware likelihood remains low as no malicious activities are explicitly present.",
