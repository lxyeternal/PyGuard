  "conclusion": "The primary security issue is the hardcoded plaintext password, which poses a significant vulnerability but does not constitute active malware. The malware score should remain low (0.1), and the security risk score should be elevated (~0.6) to reflect the insecure credential handling. No obfuscation is present. Overall, the code's insecure practice warrants caution, but there is no evidence of malicious intent or activity."
