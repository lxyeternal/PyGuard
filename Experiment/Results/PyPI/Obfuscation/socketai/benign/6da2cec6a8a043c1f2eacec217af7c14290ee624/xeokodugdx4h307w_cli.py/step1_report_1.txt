  "flows": "No data flow or processing present.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of only a coding declaration comment; no actual code, logic, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a shebang and encoding declaration, with no executable logic, data handling, or imported modules. There are no source or sink points, no data flows, and no anomalies indicating malicious activity. This appears to be a minimal, non-functional file, likely a placeholder or boilerplate.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. It is a benign, empty code file with no operational content.",
