  "anomalies": "The code contains only a coding declaration comment with no executable code; no suspicious or unusual code present.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is a minimal header comment indicating UTF-8 encoding, which is standard practice. There are no functions, variables, imports, or any logic that could be malicious. Since the code is only a comment, there are no data sources, sinks, or flows to analyze. The absence of executable or data-handling code means there is no apparent security concern or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, consisting solely of a UTF-8 encoding declaration comment with no malicious intent or security risks.",
