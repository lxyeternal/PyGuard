  "purpose": "This code snippet contains only a file encoding declaration, serving as a placeholder or boilerplate with no executable logic.",
  "sources": "No data sources; only a comment line declaring encoding.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code contains no data processing or transfer.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is a minimal, standard comment line with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is solely a comment specifying UTF-8 encoding, with no executable code, data handling, or network activity. All reports correctly identify the snippet as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate. Confidence levels are high, reflecting certainty in benign nature, except for report 5 which is cautious due to minimal content but still accurate. There are no logical flaws or inconsistencies in the assessments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, containing only a standard encoding declaration. All reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
