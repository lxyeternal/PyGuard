  "purpose": "This code snippet serves as a file header specifying UTF-8 encoding, with no executable code or data processing.",
  "sources": "No data sources; only a comment line declaring encoding.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow or untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink flows; code contains only a comment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; minimal, straightforward comment with no suspicious or malicious content.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single comment line indicating UTF-8 encoding. It contains no executable code, data input/output, or logic. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent with the benign and minimal nature of the snippet. No further analysis or action is necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, containing only a declaration comment with no malicious intent or security risks. The existing scores are appropriate and justified.",
