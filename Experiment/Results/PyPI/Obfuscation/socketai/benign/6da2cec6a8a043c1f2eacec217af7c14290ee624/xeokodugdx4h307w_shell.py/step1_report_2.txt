  "purpose": "The code appears to only specify the encoding for the Python source file.",
  "sources": "The only source is the file encoding declaration in the first line.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; no untrusted data handling or external outputs present.",
  "flows": "No data flows are identifiable due to the minimal content.",
  "anomalies": "The code is an incomplete fragment containing only a coding declaration, with no executable logic, functions, or data processing.",
  "analysis": "The provided code consists solely of a single encoding declaration comment. It does not perform any operations, data input/output, or logic. There are no suspicious behaviors, external data interactions, or security risks evident in this fragment. As it stands, it appears to be a minimal or placeholder file, possibly part of a larger project, but on its own, it presents no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal file containing only a character encoding declaration, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It likely serves as a metadata indicator within a larger project. No further action is necessary.",
