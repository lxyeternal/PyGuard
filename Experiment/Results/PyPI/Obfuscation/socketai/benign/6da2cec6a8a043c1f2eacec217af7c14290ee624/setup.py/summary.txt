  "conclusion": "The package contains obfuscated elements and suspicious embedded strings, notably 'xeokodugdx4h307w', which could be a malicious identifier or secret. While no active malicious behavior is detected, the obfuscation and embedded secrets justify a cautious security assessment. Further investigation into the context and associated files is recommended before deployment."
