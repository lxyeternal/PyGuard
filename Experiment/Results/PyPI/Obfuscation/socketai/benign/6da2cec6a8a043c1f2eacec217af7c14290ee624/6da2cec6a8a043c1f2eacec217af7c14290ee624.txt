      "conclusion": "The package contains obfuscated elements and suspicious embedded strings, notably 'xeokodugdx4h307w', which could be a malicious identifier or secret. While no active malicious behavior is detected, the obfuscation and embedded secrets justify a cautious security assessment. Further investigation into the context and associated files is recommended before deployment."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits insecure practices and high automation potential, posing significant security risks. No direct malware or malicious payloads are detected, but the insecure handling and obfuscation justify a high security risk score. The malware likelihood remains low as no malicious activities are explicitly present."

Report 4 exhibits some suspicious behaviors, justifying slightly higher scores in malware (0.3), obfuscation (0.4), and risk (0.45). Overall, the assessments are consistent with the provided descriptions, and no significant changes are necessary beyond the minor score adjustment for Report 4."

      "conclusion": "The snippet shows no malicious activity or code execution. The suspicious shebang line indicates potential obfuscation, but without further context or code, the risk remains low. Scores should be set accordingly, with low malware and risk scores, and a moderate to high obfuscation score due to the nonsensical string."

      "obfuscated": 0,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The primary security issue is the hardcoded plaintext password, which poses a significant vulnerability but does not constitute active malware. The malware score should remain low (0.1), and the security risk score should be elevated (~0.6) to reflect the insecure credential handling. No obfuscation is present. Overall, the code's insecure practice warrants caution, but there is no evidence of malicious intent or activity."
