  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and anomalies.",
  "sources": "Input functions, environment variables, network calls, dynamic code execution, file I/O, import statements.",
  "sinks": "Network transmissions, file modifications, environment variable access, system commands, data leaks.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input or environment variables flow into processing functions, which may lead to network calls or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated code, dynamic execution (eval/exec), hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, unusual control flow, hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits obfuscation with signs of dynamic execution, which raises suspicion but lacks concrete malicious indicators. No hardcoded credentials or malicious network activity are evident. Standard server setup and benign scripts show minimal risk. Empty or placeholder scripts pose no threat. Overall, the code's behavior is benign or mildly suspicious, with no confirmed malicious activity. The obfuscation in report 2 warrants caution but not definitive maliciousness.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with appropriate low malware and risk scores. Obfuscation in report 2 justifies a high obfuscation score but does not confirm malicious intent. Scores are consistent with the evidence; no significant revisions are necessary.",
