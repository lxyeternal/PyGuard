  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a web server with specific routes and handle requests, likely for data processing or serving web content.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from HTTP request parameters and headers, and possibly environment variables for configuration.",
  "sinks": "Response outputs, potential logging, and network communication to external domains or services.",
  "flows": "Data from HTTP requests flows through processing functions and may be sent back as responses or forwarded to external services.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns are immediately visible. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a web application, defines routes, and processes incoming requests. It uses standard libraries and frameworks, with typical request handling patterns. No malicious activities such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are evident. It appears to be a benign server implementation without suspicious logic or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward web server setup with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It should be considered low risk based on the provided fragment.",
