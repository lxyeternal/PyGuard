  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package distribution, defining metadata and configuration.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; no external data output or network activity.",
  "flows": "Reads from the README.md file to include as long description in setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names (e.g., oGIuKufCncNtofEcyQFYvGYmygDxNqZK, xqNYCZoespaCdcOcVyKCqQFgNzzcIaWX, KXHPNQYNhEickndrMoBMucHrBpVwZNgI). No actual malicious code detected, but obfuscation is unusual for such scripts. The variable names seem intentionally obscure, which could be an attempt to hide intent.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup from setuptools and os.path for filesystem operations. It defines a variable with a long, seemingly random name pointing to the current directory. It then opens a README.md file in that directory and reads its content into a variable with another obscure name. These variables are used in the setup() function call, which contains typical package metadata: license, version, classifiers, keywords, and content type. There is no code execution, data exfiltration, network activity, or other suspicious behavior. The obfuscated variable names are unusual but not inherently malicious; they could be an attempt to hide malicious intent, but the script itself is standard for a setup configuration with added obfuscation. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are evident. No external data or command execution occurs.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup.py script with obfuscated variable names. No malicious behavior detected; it appears to be a benign package configuration file, although the obfuscation raises slight suspicion. No malware or security risks are evident.",
