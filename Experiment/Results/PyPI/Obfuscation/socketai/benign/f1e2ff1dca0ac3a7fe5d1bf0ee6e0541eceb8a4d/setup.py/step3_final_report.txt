  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging, reading README.md and defining package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file; static string 'd5q0galr1714xzvy' used as a parameter value.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network calls, data exfiltration, or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "flows": "Reads file into variable, passes static metadata to setup(); no source-to-sink data flow indicating malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; hardcoded string 'd5q0galr1714xzvy' used as a parameter value, which appears as a dummy or placeholder.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script with obfuscated variable names and a suspicious-looking string. No malicious behavior, network activity, or data leaks are present. Obfuscation reduces clarity but does not imply malicious intent. The hardcoded string is likely a placeholder. Scores are consistent with benign setup code; malware score is 0, obfuscation is moderate (~0.5), and security risk is low (~0.2).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with obfuscation and a placeholder string. No evidence of malicious activity or security risks. Obfuscation warrants some suspicion but does not indicate malicious intent.",
