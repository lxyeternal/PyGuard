  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class with an obfuscated name and a static attribute containing a random string.",
  "sources": "Class attribute 'htGGpXJGtjrUoZMzvSraUdjaUvuipngU' assigned a string value.",
  "sinks": "No data input/output, network activity, or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static class definition with no runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class name and attribute, arbitrary string value, no methods or external effects.",
  "analysis": "The code is a syntactically correct Python class inheriting from Exception, with obfuscated naming and a static string attribute. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or system modifications. The obfuscation may be intended to conceal purpose but does not, in itself, indicate malicious intent. The low malware and security risk scores assigned by the reports are justified. The high obfuscation score reflects the obfuscated identifiers, but no malicious behavior is evident. Overall, the code appears benign, with obfuscation being the primary red flag, which alone does not constitute malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a benign, obfuscated class definition with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not, in isolation, indicate malware or significant threat.",
