  "purpose": "Custom exception class definition, likely for use in a larger Python project.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; only class and attribute definition.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external effects; no data leaks or malicious output points.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the class is merely a container with a static string.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of an obfuscated-looking class name and a seemingly random string assigned to a class attribute. No functional behavior or logic. The string appears arbitrary and could be intended to hide malicious intent or simply be a distraction.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class inheriting from Exception, with an attribute that contains a random string. There are no input/output operations, no data processing, and no network interactions. The random string 'iaTZLqzyDUJZSiJAcXCQCcHOtFEQqGaK' appears to be a placeholder or obfuscated data, but with no further context, it does not indicate malicious behavior. The class structure itself is benign, though the obfuscated naming and data may be a red flag in some contexts.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a simple, possibly obfuscated class definition for a custom exception. There is no direct evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet. The unusual class and attribute names may be intended to obscure, but without additional context, it remains harmless.",
