{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class with an unusual attribute value, likely for error handling or signaling within a larger application.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; no external data sources used.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; the code does not process or output data, nor does it handle untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the class simply declares a constant attribute without any operations or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of an obfuscated attribute name and a seemingly random string assigned to it, which may indicate an attempt to hide intent or contain malicious data.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class inheriting from Exception. The class has an attribute with an obfuscated name and a string value that appears random and nonsensical. No input reading, data processing, or security-relevant operations are present. The obfuscation may be intended to conceal malicious intent or data, but on its own, it is not definitive. No external dependencies or code injection points are evident. The class could be part of larger malicious code, but by itself, it is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit explicit malicious behavior but contains obfuscated elements that could be used for concealment. It appears to be a harmless class definition in isolation, with no immediate security risks or malware indicators.",
