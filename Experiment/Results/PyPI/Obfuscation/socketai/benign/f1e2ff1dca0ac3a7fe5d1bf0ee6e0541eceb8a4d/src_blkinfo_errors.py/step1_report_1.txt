  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class with a hardcoded attribute value.",
  "sources": "The class definition itself, with no external data input.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the class attribute is hardcoded.",
  "anomalies": "Contains a hardcoded string attribute that appears arbitrary; no other suspicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of Exception with an attribute containing an obfuscated-looking string. There are no input, output, network, or system modification operations. The presence of the class and the attribute alone does not indicate malicious intent; it could be part of a larger codebase. No malicious patterns such as data exfiltration, network connections, or backdoors are evident. The attribute value seems arbitrary and might be used for internal logic or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple custom exception class with a hardcoded attribute. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this isolated fragment.",
