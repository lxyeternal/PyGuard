{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class with a seemingly arbitrary string attribute, likely for error handling or specific exception identification.",
  "sources": "Class definition and attribute assignment.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink; the code is purely structural.",
  "anomalies": "The class name appears obfuscated or auto-generated; the attribute name and value are nonsensical and seem designed to obscure intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class inheriting from Exception, with a class attribute containing a random string. No data input, output, or processing occurs. The attribute might be used for identification or as a marker, but there is no clear malicious behavior or typical indicators of malware such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The obfuscated naming could be an attempt to evade detection or obscure purpose, but alone, it does not demonstrate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign custom exception class with obfuscated naming. No malicious activity or security risks are evident based on this snippet alone.",
