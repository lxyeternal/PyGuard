  "purpose": "Import a class/function with an obfuscated name from a local module 'filters'.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no data input or external sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are identifiable in this isolated line.",
  "anomalies": "The imported entity name 'EuYlsXGtkiEpkRZFhQnXcqmKpJKDTFAP' is highly obfuscated, which is suspicious and may indicate concealment or auto-generation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward import from a local module, with an obfuscated entity name. The import alone does not demonstrate malicious behavior; however, obfuscation raises suspicion. The malware scores are low (around 0.1-0.3), consistent with the absence of direct malicious activity. Obfuscation scores are high (~0.75), justified by the naming pattern. Risk scores are low (~0.2), indicating minimal immediate threat but warranting further review of the 'filters' module and downstream usage. No logical errors or code flaws are present; the cautious approach is appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is syntactically correct and benign in isolation but suspicious due to the obfuscated name. There is no evidence of malicious activity based solely on this line. Further investigation into the 'filters' module and how the imported entity is used is recommended to rule out malicious intent.",
