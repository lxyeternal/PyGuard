  "purpose": "Import a specific object or module named 'EuYlsXGtkiEpkRZFhQnXcqmKpJKDTFAP' from a local package 'filters'.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads from a local module or package 'filters'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted destinations are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Import statement pulls 'EuYlsXGtkiEpkRZFhQnXcqmKpJKDTFAP' from 'filters' without further processing.",
  "anomalies": "The imported name 'EuYlsXGtkiEpkRZFhQnXcqmKpJKDTFAP' appears as a nonsensical, obfuscated or auto-generated identifier, which may suggest obfuscation or hiding intent. No additional code is provided to evaluate further malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code only performs a single import statement from a local module named 'filters'. The imported identifier is a long, seemingly random string, which could indicate obfuscation or an auto-generated name. No other logic, data processing, or network interaction is present. Without additional context, it is not possible to determine malicious intent from this snippet alone. However, the obfuscated import name warrants suspicion of hiding functionality or avoiding detection.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there is no definitive evidence of malicious behavior; however, the obfuscated import name raises concerns about potential concealment. Additional code review would be necessary to confirm any malicious intent or security risks.",
