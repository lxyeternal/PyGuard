{
  "purpose": "System utility for enumerating block devices, iSCSI connections, and device hierarchies on Linux systems.",
  "sources": "Filesystem links in /sys/devices/ and /sys/block/, subprocess calls to 'lsblk', and reading device info files.",
  "sinks": "Internal data structures; no external data exfiltration or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from filesystem reads and subprocess outputs into internal dictionaries and objects, with no external transmission.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of method and variable names; complex filesystem interactions; no hardcoded secrets or network connections.",
  "analysis": "The code performs device enumeration using standard Linux interfaces and subprocess calls. Obfuscated method names suggest an attempt to conceal internal logic but do not indicate malicious intent. No signs of data exfiltration, command injection, or malicious payloads are present. The code's purpose aligns with system inventory or diagnostics, and it does not perform any harmful actions. The filesystem interactions are typical for such utilities, and the obfuscation appears to be for concealment rather than malicious sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate system device enumeration utility with obfuscated naming. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2), consistent with its benign purpose. Obfuscation is moderate but not indicative of malicious intent.",
