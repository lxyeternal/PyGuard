  "purpose": "To evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on supply chain security indicators.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, user input, or external data sources; code execution points such as eval/exec; network or file sinks; hardcoded secrets or credentials.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable leaks, data exfiltration points, dynamic code execution functions.",
  "flows": "From sources like environment variables or user input to sinks such as network transmission, file system, or code execution points.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded secrets, dynamic eval/exec usage, obfuscation, suspicious network activity, unusual data flows, or code complexity without clear purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code appears straightforward with no obfuscation or malicious patterns. No suspicious network activity, credential leaks, or hardcoded secrets are evident. Data flows from input sources to sinks are typical and do not indicate malicious intent. The absence of code or suspicious constructs results in low malware and obfuscation scores. Slightly elevated security risk scores (around 0.2-0.3) reflect cautious consideration of potential hidden issues like hardcoded secrets or dynamic code execution, but no concrete evidence is present. Confidence levels are high where code is absent or benign, and moderate where potential concerns are noted.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. Security risks are minimal and primarily cautious, based on potential but unconfirmed issues. Overall, the dependency appears safe with no supply chain compromise detected.",
