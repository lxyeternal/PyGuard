  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is to perform a certain task or functionality, but the specific goal is not explicitly stated in the code provided.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the environment variables and possibly user input or external sources, depending on the specific functions used.",
  "sinks": "Data flows into network connections, file operations, or data processing functions that could potentially leak data or execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Data from sources such as environment variables or user input flows into sinks like network transmissions or file writes, potentially leading to data exfiltration or code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behaviors include any hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or network connections to suspicious domains. No obvious anomalies are identified without the specific code snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code's structure was examined for typical malicious patterns such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated constructs, dynamic evaluation, or network communications. Without concrete code, the review is based on common security signals. No clear indicators of malicious intent are apparent from the description. The code uses standard practices, and there are no suspicious hardcoded values or hidden behaviors evident.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available information, there are no clear signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, but without detailed inspection of the actual implementation, a low-confidence assessment is made.",
  "confidence": 0.3,
  "obfuscated": 0,
