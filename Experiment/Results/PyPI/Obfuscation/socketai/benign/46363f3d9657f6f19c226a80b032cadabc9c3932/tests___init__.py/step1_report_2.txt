{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be a Python package intended for general use, possibly providing utility functions or a library component.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input functions, environment variables, and potentially external files or network sources (if present in omitted parts).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections (e.g., requests to external servers), file operations, subprocess calls, or environment variable usage that could leak data or execute commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as user input or environment variables to sinks like network requests or system calls, but specific flow paths are not fully detailed in the provided snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are evident. The code appears standard with typical function definitions and data handling. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code contains standard Python constructs, imports, and function definitions. Without specific details of the code's internal logic, no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command injection, or backdoors are visible. There are no indicators of suspicious activities such as dynamic execution of untrusted code or hidden behaviors. Since the code appears clean and straightforward, no anomalies or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there is no evidence of malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risks. The code appears to be a legitimate, non-obfuscated Python module. Due to the limited snippet, the confidence score is high, but some assumptions are made in the absence of full context.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
