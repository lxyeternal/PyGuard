  "purpose": "Testing UUID utility functions, including generation, conversion, and validation, using obfuscated import and variable names.",
  "sources": "Imported functions from 'uuid_utils.compat' with obfuscated names; input data includes static UUID-related parameters and byte strings.",
  "sinks": "Type assertions on UUID objects; no external data flows, network activity, or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Function calls with parameters (including constants and namespace identifiers) leading to type assertions; no external or untrusted data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of import names and variables; no secrets or malicious code; no unusual control flow or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward test code for UUID functions, with obfuscated identifiers. No malicious behavior, network activity, or data exfiltration is present. Obfuscation is likely superficial, intended to conceal code structure but not malicious intent. The assertions confirm the functions return UUID objects, and inputs are static or controlled. The absence of external data handling or system modifications indicates low security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of UUID utility tests with obfuscated naming. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. Obfuscation raises suspicion but does not imply malicious intent based on this code alone. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score should be set to 0. The obfuscation score is justified at a high level (~0.75), and the overall risk remains low (~0.2). The reports are accurate and consistent with the code analysis.",
