{
  "purpose": "This code module imports UUID constants and functions from the standard library and a local utility module, then exposes them via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from the standard uuid library and the local _uuid_utils module, including cryptic variable and function names.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code only defines and exports constants and functions.",
  "flows": "The module imports various UUID-related identifiers and re-exports them; no data flows involving untrusted input are evident.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of numerous cryptic or obfuscated-looking variable and function names imported from _uuid_utils; no dynamic code execution or data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility module that manages UUID constants and functions, with unusual naming in the imported _uuid_utils. No malicious code, network activity, or data processing is present. The obfuscated names raise suspicion but could be benign internal utilities or placeholders. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: ~0.4-0.6, risk: ~0.2) are consistent with the static and benign nature of the code, aside from obfuscation concerns. Without the implementation of _uuid_utils, further assessment is limited, but current evidence suggests no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, functioning as a UUID utility module with some obfuscated internal identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not constitute malicious behavior based on this fragment.",
