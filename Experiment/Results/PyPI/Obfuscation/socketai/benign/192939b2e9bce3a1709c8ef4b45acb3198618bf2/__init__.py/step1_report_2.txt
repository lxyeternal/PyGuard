{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define module imports and exports related to a larger package, likely for image processing or visualization tasks in a scientific context.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal module files: _version, _reader, _sample_data, _widget, _writer",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no data processing, network operations, or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from external input to sensitive operations detected",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names (e.g., VmLVXgqoLajHSPIubDTphNQJYFwTilHl, kiEFuXmUTDuOFeCmbQLXBBgpdnPwFXsV, etc.), no functional code logic or data processing, only import/export statements; no suspicious behaviors or backdoors",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements with obfuscated variable names and a module export list. There are no functions, data handling, or network operations. The obfuscated variable names suggest code obfuscation but do not inherently indicate malicious intent. The imports are internal, from presumably safe package modules, and the __all__ list defines public API symbols. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are evident, nor are there any indicators of data leaks or malicious code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module import and export declaration with obfuscated variable names. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The obfuscation may be intentional to hide internal details but does not imply malicious intent.",
