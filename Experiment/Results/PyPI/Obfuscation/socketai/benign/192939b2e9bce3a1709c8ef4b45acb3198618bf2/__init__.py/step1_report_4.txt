  "purpose": "Importing modules and defining exports for a Python package related to image processing or visualization.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules: _version, _reader, _sample_data, _widget, _writer",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks or external communication identified",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; imports are from internal modules",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated-looking variable names (e.g., VmLVXgqoLajHSPIubDTphNQJYFwTilHl, kiEFuXmUTDuOFeCmbQLXBBgpdnPwFXsV) suggests possible obfuscation or concealment, but no malicious activity is evident",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements from internal modules, with fallback logic for version import. The variable names appear intentionally obscure, which could be a sign of obfuscation but not necessarily malicious. The __all__ tuple indicates exposure of specific functions or classes, typical in package exports. No external network activity, credential handling, or suspicious operations are present. The code appears to serve as a module initialization or setup script, with no malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious intent or harmful behavior. The obscurity of variable names alone does not imply maliciousness but warrants caution. Overall, the code appears benign.",
