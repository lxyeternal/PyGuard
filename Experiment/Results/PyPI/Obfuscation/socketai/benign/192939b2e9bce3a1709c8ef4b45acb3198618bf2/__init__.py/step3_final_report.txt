  "purpose": "Module initialization and export setup for a Python package, importing internal modules and defining __all__ for public API.",
  "sources": "Conditional import of version, internal module imports with obfuscated variable names",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external communication or data leaks present",
  "flows": "Import statements and __all__ definition; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names for internal modules; no malicious code or suspicious behaviors detected",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard package setup with conditional version import and internal module imports using obfuscated variable names. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks are present. Obfuscation appears stylistic or for internal concealment, not malicious. The scores across reports correctly reflect the benign nature, with malware score at 0, obfuscation scores moderate to high (0.4-0.8), and low security risk (~0.2). No anomalies or malicious indicators are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a package initializer with obfuscated internal variable names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or security vulnerabilities. Obfuscation does not imply malicious intent in this context. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
