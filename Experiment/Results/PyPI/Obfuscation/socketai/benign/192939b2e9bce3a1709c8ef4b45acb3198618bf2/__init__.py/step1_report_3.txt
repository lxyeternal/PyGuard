{
  "purpose": "Import modules and define public API for a Python package, likely related to image processing or visualization.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (_version, _reader, _sample_data, _widget, _writer).",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data could cause leaks or effects; no network, file, or environment variable usage observed.",
  "flows": "Imports provide module attributes; no data flows from external sources to sinks that could lead to security issues.",
  "anomalies": "The import of version with an alias that defaults to 'unknown' on ImportError is common; the module names are obfuscated (e.g., kiEFuXmUTDuOFeCmbQLXBBgpdnPwFXsV), but this is typical for code obfuscation or generated code, not necessarily malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs safe local imports and defines __all__ for public API exposure. The obfuscated module names might suggest code minimization or obfuscation, but they do not indicate malicious intent. There are no network connections, data exfiltration, or system modifications present. The try-except block handles missing version info gracefully, which is standard practice.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical module initialization script with obfuscated internal module names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
