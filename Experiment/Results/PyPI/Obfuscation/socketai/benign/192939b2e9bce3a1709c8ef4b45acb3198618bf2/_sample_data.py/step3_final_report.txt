{
  "purpose": "Load two NIfTI files ('image.nii.gz' and 'label.nii.gz') from a sample data directory, modify metadata, and append label information for visualization.",
  "sources": "Reads data from 'sample_datas/image.nii.gz' and 'sample_datas/label.nii.gz' using an obfuscated function imported from 'napari_itk_io._reader'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external communication; data is loaded and metadata is modified locally.",
  "flows": "Source files are read into variables, metadata is modified, label data is converted to int, and label info is appended to the dataset.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated function name 'kpQFsFElXERiTzxtdkTNJkgdSgRIkrvO' and import path, which could be an attempt to conceal behavior but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code loads medical imaging data, modifies metadata, and appends label layers for visualization. No network activity, code injection, or malicious operations are present. The obfuscation of function and module names raises suspicion but is not inherently malicious. The operations are standard for neuroimaging workflows, and the data is handled locally. The obfuscation may be for privacy or to hinder reverse engineering but does not constitute malicious behavior. The malware score is justified as 0, given no evidence of malicious activity. The obfuscation score is moderate (~0.6), reflecting the suspicious naming but benign operations. The overall security risk is low (~0.2).",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a benign medical imaging data loader with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malware or malicious intent. The obfuscation warrants cautious review but does not elevate the security risk significantly.",
