  "purpose": "The code loads numpy array files (.npy), processes them into stacked and squeezed arrays, and returns the data along with metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads input filenames or file paths via function arguments, specifically from string or list inputs.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no network, file writing, or system modification observed.",
  "flows": "Input filename(s) -> np.load() -> np.stack() -> np.squeeze() -> return data structure",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated function and variable names; the function 'kiEFuXmUTDuOFeCmbQLXBBgpdnPwFXsV' references an undefined variable 'kpQFsFElXERiTzxtdkTNJkgdSgRIkrvO' in its return statement, indicating incomplete or broken code; no input validation or sanitization is present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily loads numpy arrays from specified files, stacks and squeezes them into a single array, and returns this data with some metadata. The obfuscated naming suggests an attempt to conceal intent but does not inherently indicate malicious activity. The key concern is the incomplete function that references an undefined variable, which could cause runtime errors or be exploited if inputs are untrusted. No network activity, system modifications, or malicious payloads are detected. The obfuscation level is moderate to high, but this alone does not imply malicious behavior. The lack of input validation poses a potential security risk if untrusted inputs are used, but no active malicious actions are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign data-loading logic with obfuscation that could be used to conceal malicious intent. The main issue is the incomplete or broken function referencing an undefined variable, which warrants correction but does not directly indicate malicious activity. The overall security risk is low, but the obfuscation and incomplete code suggest caution, especially if inputs are untrusted or if the code is part of a supply chain where malicious payloads could be hidden.",
