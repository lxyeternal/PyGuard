  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, albeit obfuscated, scientific visualization and simulation tool for napari. There is no evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or supply chain attacks. The obfuscation is superficial and likely for intellectual property protection. The overall security risk is low."
