  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign utility functions with heavy obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or vulnerabilities. The obfuscation may be superficial or intended to conceal complexity but does not, in itself, indicate malicious intent. Scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware risk is zero, obfuscation is high, and overall security risk is low."
