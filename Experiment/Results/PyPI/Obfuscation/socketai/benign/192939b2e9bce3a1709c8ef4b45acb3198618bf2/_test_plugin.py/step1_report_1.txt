{
  "purpose": "The code initializes a Napari viewer, creates a widget instance, and adds it as a dock widget to the viewer, then runs the Napari event loop.",
  "sources": "Imports from napari and a custom module 'napari_potential_field_navigation._widget'. Reads user interaction via Napari viewer event loop.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly, but the code could potentially execute or display widgets within the viewer, which could be used maliciously if the widget is malicious.",
  "flows": "Imports → widget instantiation → adding widget as dock → running viewer loop.",
  "anomalies": "The widget class name 'SfGACxBeqfJDgdaqXytrItucOmVDBbKS' appears obfuscated or auto-generated, but there is no evidence it performs malicious actions. The function name and variable names are nonsensical, possibly obfuscated, but this alone isn't suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly initializes a Napari viewer and adds a custom widget to it. The widget class is imported from a seemingly obfuscated or auto-generated module. The overall structure is typical for a plugin or visualization script. No malicious network activity, data exfiltration, or system modification is apparent. The import of a custom widget could be suspicious if the widget's source is malicious, but based solely on this code, no malicious behavior is evident. The use of obfuscated names suggests possible attempt to hide intent, but without additional context or the widget code, this cannot be conclusively malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Napari plugin or visualization script with obfuscated identifiers. There is no clear evidence of malicious behavior or malware based solely on this code snippet. The risk is low, but the obfuscation warrants caution if the source of the widget is untrusted.",
