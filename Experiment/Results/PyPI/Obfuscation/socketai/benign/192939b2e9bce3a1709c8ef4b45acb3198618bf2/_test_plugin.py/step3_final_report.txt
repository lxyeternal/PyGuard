{
  "purpose": "Initialize a napari viewer, instantiate a potentially obfuscated widget, add it as a dock widget, and start the napari event loop.",
  "sources": "Importing the widget class from an obfuscated module; creating viewer instance; calling a custom, obfuscated napari method.",
  "sinks": "The code does not explicitly handle untrusted input or perform data leaks; no sinks identified that could lead to data exfiltration or system compromise.",
  "flows": "Import widget -> instantiate widget -> add widget as dock to viewer -> run napari event loop via obfuscated method.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class name and function names; use of a non-standard napari method call; lack of source code transparency for the imported widget.",
  "analysis": "The code follows a standard pattern for a napari plugin: initialize viewer, create widget, add as dock, and run event loop. The obfuscated identifiers and custom method suggest attempts to conceal behavior, but no evidence of malicious activity such as network communication, file modification, or data exfiltration is present. The obfuscation warrants caution, and further inspection of the widget's internal code is recommended. Scores reflect low malware likelihood but high obfuscation concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical visualization plugin with obfuscated identifiers. No explicit malicious actions are evident, but the obfuscation warrants further review of the widget source to rule out hidden malicious behavior.",
