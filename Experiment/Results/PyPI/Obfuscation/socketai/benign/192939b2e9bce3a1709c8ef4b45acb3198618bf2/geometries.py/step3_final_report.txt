  "purpose": "Defines spatial bounding box classes for 2D and 3D with size and containment functions.",
  "sources": "Reads 'pos' parameters in containment functions, accesses 'min' and 'max' attributes.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or system interactions detected.",
  "flows": "Input 'pos' is clamped between 'min' and 'max'; comparison checks for containment.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names; no malicious code or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code implements simple bounding box data structures with size and containment methods using the Taichi library. No external data, network activity, or system modifications are present. The naming is obfuscated, which suggests code obfuscation but not malicious intent. The containment functions perform standard clamping and comparison logic. No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or sabotage are detected. The obfuscation is consistent with code obfuscation practices, not malicious concealment. The malware score is appropriately zero; the obfuscation score is high due to naming; the security risk is minimal.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward spatial utility classes with obfuscated naming. No malicious activity or sabotage detected. The high obfuscation score reflects naming obfuscation but does not imply malicious intent. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use.",
