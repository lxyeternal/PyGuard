  "purpose": "Define data structures for 2D and 3D bounding boxes with utility functions for dimension calculation and point containment checks.",
  "sources": "None explicitly reading external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output functions; the code is primarily defining classes and methods.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the functions perform internal calculations and checks.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears to be straightforward geometric utility classes; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code behaviors detected. No network, system, or privacy-related operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two dataclasses representing axis-aligned bounding boxes in 2D and 3D space using Taichi's data structures. Utility methods calculate width, height/depth, and perform containment checks via clamping. The methods are standard geometric operations, with no external data input, no output or network operations, and no suspicious logic. No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The code appears to be part of a larger graphics or simulation framework, with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of bounding box utility classes using Taichi. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It is safe and serves a typical geometric purpose.",
