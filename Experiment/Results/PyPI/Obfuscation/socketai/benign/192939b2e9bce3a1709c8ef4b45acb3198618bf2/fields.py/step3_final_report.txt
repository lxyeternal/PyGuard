{
  "purpose": "The code implements classes and functions for scalar and vector field representations, gradient computations, normalization, scaling, and visualization, primarily for scientific analysis and visualization of multidimensional fields.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from numpy arrays, class properties, and imported geometries (though unused). Data flows from numpy arrays into Taichi fields and computations.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network activity, or file I/O; computations and visualization are internal and local.",
  "flows": "Data originates from numpy arrays, is converted into Taichi fields, processed through gradient and normalization functions, and visualized via matplotlib.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and function names; imported geometries are unused; no suspicious external activity or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily scientific and visualization-oriented, involving multidimensional field manipulations, gradient calculations, and plotting. Obfuscation appears superficial, likely for code concealment or domain-specific reasons. No signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a scientific utility for field analysis and visualization with obfuscated naming but no malicious intent. It poses minimal security risk.",
