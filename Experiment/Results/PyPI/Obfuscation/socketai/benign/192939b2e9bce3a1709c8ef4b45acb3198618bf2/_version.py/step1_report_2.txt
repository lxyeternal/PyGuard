{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define version information and type annotations, likely for a package or module metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded string values for version information and a boolean flag to determine type annotation usage.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sensitive sinks are present; no data leaks or insecure operations identified.",
  "flows": "The boolean flag influences the type annotation for a variable; otherwise, variables are assigned hardcoded version info.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional type annotation based on a hardcoded boolean is unusual but not malicious. No secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a boolean flag RzNDRJyUxkJMgtpmuUuWZYezzTpdvhXv to False. If it were True, it would import typing modules and define a tuple type; otherwise, a generic object. It then assigns version info strings and tuples. The structure suggests conditional type annotation based on a flag. All data is hardcoded, and there are no external data reads or suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, primarily setting version variables and conditional type annotations. No malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks detected.",
