  "purpose": "Defines version information and a type annotation variable controlled by a static boolean flag, with version strings and tuples assigned statically.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded boolean flag, version strings, and tuple assignments.",
  "sinks": "None; no external input, output, or data processing occurs.",
  "flows": "Static assignment of version info and conditional import based on a fixed boolean flag.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; static boolean controlling import; no dynamic or external data.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign configuration snippet setting version info with obfuscated variable names. It uses a static boolean to control whether type annotations are imported, but the flag is fixed to False, leading to a straightforward assignment. No external data, network activity, or malicious behavior is present. The obfuscation is superficial, mainly variable naming, not malicious. The code's simplicity and static nature indicate no security risks or malware. The obfuscation score could be slightly higher due to variable naming but does not imply malicious intent. Overall, the code is safe, with minimal security risk and no malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration snippet with superficial obfuscation and no security issues. The malware score is 0, the obfuscation score around 0.6, and the security risk is very low (~0.1). The existing reports are accurate; no significant adjustments are necessary.",
