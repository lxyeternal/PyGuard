{
  "purpose": "Conditional assignment of version information and type alias based on a boolean flag.",
  "sources": "The boolean variable RzNDRJyUxkJMgtpmuUuWZYezzTpdvhXv; the string '0.1.1'.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks that process untrusted data or perform security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "The boolean flag controls whether a type alias is imported or assigned; version information is set statically.",
  "anomalies": "The boolean variable is hardcoded to False; the conditional branch involving type alias is unused or trivial; no user input, network activity, or external data is involved.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a boolean flag RzNDRJyUxkJMgtpmuUuWZYezzTpdvhXv set to False, which prevents the import of Tuple and Union from 'typing'. Instead, it assigns a generic object to eGxdKobDXsWHRMFKQkaoLdjVBntZWjiP. The version variables are statically set to '0.1.1' and (0, 1, 1). There is no data flow from external inputs or sensitive operations. The code appears to be a simple version configuration setup with obfuscated variable names, but no malicious or suspicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration snippet with obfuscated variable names. No malicious behavior, security risks, or data leaks are detected. The structure suggests code obfuscation but does not pose security threats.",
