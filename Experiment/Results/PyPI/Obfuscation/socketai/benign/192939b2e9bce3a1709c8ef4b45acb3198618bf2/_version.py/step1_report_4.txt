  "purpose": "Define version information and type annotations based on a condition.",
  "sources": "Reads the boolean value RzNDRJyUxkJMgtpmuUuWZYezzTpdvhXv to determine type annotations; assigns version strings and tuples.",
  "sinks": "Assigns version strings and tuples; no external data or untrusted input used.",
  "flows": "Boolean value determines type annotation; then version info is assigned directly to variables.",
  "anomalies": "The boolean flag RzNDRJyUxkJMgtpmuUuWZYezzTpdvhXv is hardcoded to False, leading to static execution path. No external input or dynamic code execution observed. No secrets or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a boolean flag RzNDRJyUxkJMgtpmuUuWZYezzTpdvhXv to False. Based on this, it conditionally imports typing.Tuple and Union, which is standard practice and not malicious. The variable names are obfuscated but appear consistent. The code assigns version strings and tuples directly, with no external inputs or dynamic data. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network activity, data leakage, or backdoors. The code structure is simple and straightforward, with no obfuscated code or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward version assignment with a static condition, no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It appears to be safe and intentional for version handling.",
