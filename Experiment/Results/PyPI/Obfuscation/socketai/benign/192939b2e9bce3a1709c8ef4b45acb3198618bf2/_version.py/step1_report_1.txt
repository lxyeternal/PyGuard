  "purpose": "Define version information and type annotations based on a flag",
  "sources": "Assignment to RzNDRJyUxkJMgtpmuUuWZYezzTpdvhXv, which controls whether type annotations are imported",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no data is transmitted or processed insecurely",
  "flows": "The boolean flag controls import of typing, which then influences variable type annotations; no external data flow observed",
  "anomalies": "Conditional import based on a hardcoded boolean flag, which appears to be static; no malicious intent evident",
  "analysis": "The code sets a boolean flag to False, then conditionally imports type annotations if the flag is True. Given the flag is False, it assigns 'object' to a variable intended for type annotations. It then defines version strings and a version tuple, assigning the same value to multiple variables. The code appears to be configuration or metadata setup with no external input or output, and no suspicious behavior or malicious activity detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign; it primarily manages version metadata with a static flag influencing type annotation import. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks are present.",
