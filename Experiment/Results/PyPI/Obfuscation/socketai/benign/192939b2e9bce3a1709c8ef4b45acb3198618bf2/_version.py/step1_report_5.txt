{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define version information and a type alias based on a conditional flag.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded string literals and a boolean flag RzNDRJyUxkJMgtpmuUuWZYezzTpdvhXv.",
  "sinks": "There are no clear sinks that process untrusted data; no data leakage or external communication is present.",
  "flows": "The version string and tuple are assigned from hardcoded values without external input; the conditional influences type aliasing.",
  "anomalies": "The boolean flag is hardcoded as False, leading to a straightforward assignment, but the variable names are obfuscated. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a boolean variable RzNDRJyUxkJMgtpmuUuWZYezzTpdvhXv set to False, which disables importing certain typing aliases. It then assigns a type alias based on this flag. The version information is hardcoded as '0.1.1' and a corresponding tuple. All operations are straightforward, with no indication of malicious intent or obfuscation. The variable names are intentionally obscure but do not suggest malicious behavior. There are no external data sources, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious data flows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and benign, mainly defining version info and conditional type aliasing. No malicious behavior, no suspicious patterns, and no security risks are detected.",
