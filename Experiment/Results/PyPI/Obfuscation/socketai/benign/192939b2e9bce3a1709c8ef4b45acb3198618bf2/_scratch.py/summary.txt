  "conclusion": "The code is primarily for visualization purposes. While the obfuscated import and variable names raise suspicion, there is no concrete evidence of malicious activity. The malware score should remain at 0, with a high obfuscation suspicion score (around 0.7). The overall security risk is low (around 0.2-0.3), but obfuscation warrants further review if possible."
