{
  "purpose": "Visualization of astronomical data with tracked objects using napari.",
  "sources": "The function 'hubble_deep_field()' from an obfuscated module imported from 'skimage'.",
  "sinks": "None; no network, file, or system modification activity detected.",
  "flows": "Data loaded from 'hubble_deep_field()' used directly in visualization; no external data flows or untrusted input handling.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated import statement 'from skimage import NPlTsdgauePbDloKLQJzEweuqqGAXmJq' and nonsensical variable names; no clear source or documentation for 'hubble_deep_field()'.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily loads a dataset via an obfuscated import, creates coordinate and confidence arrays, and visualizes them in napari. No evidence of malicious activity such as network communication, data exfiltration, or system modification. The obfuscation suggests suspicious intent but could also be placeholder or code obfuscation. The function 'hubble_deep_field()' appears to be a dataset loader, but its origin is unclear. No malicious code or behavior is present based on the provided snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily for visualization purposes. While the obfuscated import and variable names raise suspicion, there is no concrete evidence of malicious activity. The malware score should remain at 0, with a high obfuscation suspicion score (around 0.7). The overall security risk is low (around 0.2-0.3), but obfuscation warrants further review if possible.",
