The obfuscation may be superficial or intended to conceal complexity but does not, in itself, indicate malicious intent. Scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware risk is zero, obfuscation is high, and overall security risk is low."

      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign data-loading logic with obfuscation that could be used to conceal malicious intent. The main issue is the incomplete or broken function referencing an undefined variable, which warrants correction but does not directly indicate malicious activity. The overall security risk is low, but the obfuscation and incomplete code suggest caution, especially if inputs are untrusted or if the code is part of a supply chain where malicious payloads could be hidden."

There is no evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or supply chain attacks. The obfuscation is superficial and likely for intellectual property protection. The overall security risk is low."

      "conclusion": "The code is primarily for visualization purposes. While the obfuscated import and variable names raise suspicion, there is no concrete evidence of malicious activity. The malware score should remain at 0, with a high obfuscation suspicion score (around 0.7). The overall security risk is low (around 0.2-0.3), but obfuscation warrants further review if possible."
