  "conclusion": "The code is highly risky due to its capacity to execute arbitrary, untrusted scripts, combined with obfuscation and internal API manipulation. While no explicit malicious payloads are present, its design enables malicious exploitation. It should be treated as potentially malicious, requiring strict validation, sandboxing, or removal in security-sensitive environments."
