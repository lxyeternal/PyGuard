{
  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python module, including reading a README file and configuring package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading the README file via the read() function; fetching the current directory using os.path.abspath and os.path.dirname.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network connections, file writes, or command executions are present that handle untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks that could lead to malicious behavior. The code reads static files and uses static values for configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names (e.g., ADCOBzrVuIJlgGUJYgqCoGPVvuXxZoPG) and the use of a dynamically formatted download URL with package version. The code appears intentionally obfuscated or coded in a way that could hinder analysis. No clear malicious code or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily sets up package metadata and reads a README file for inclusion in distribution. The obfuscated variable names suggest an attempt to conceal the code's purpose, but no malicious functions, network activities, or malicious behaviors are evident. It follows typical setup.py patterns, with added obfuscation in variable naming. There are no signs of malicious payloads, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code is likely intended for normal packaging, albeit with obfuscated variable names that could hinder readability.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a standard setup script for packaging a Python module, with obfuscated variable names but no malicious behavior detected. It does not contain malware or security risks based on the provided content.",
