  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated setup script with no evidence of malware. The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not indicate malicious intent. The undefined variable is a coding error that should be fixed for proper execution. Overall, the package appears safe, with scores consistent with the analysis."
