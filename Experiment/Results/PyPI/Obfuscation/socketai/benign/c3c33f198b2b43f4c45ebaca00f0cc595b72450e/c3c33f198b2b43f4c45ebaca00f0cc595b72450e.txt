      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated setup script with no evidence of malware. The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not indicate malicious intent. The undefined variable is a coding error that should be fixed for proper execution. Overall, the package appears safe, with scores consistent with the analysis."

      "conclusion": "The code employs obfuscation tactics typical of malicious scripts but does not exhibit direct malicious actions. The external library is legitimate, but the obfuscated function call warrants caution. Malware score is low (0.3), obfuscation high (0.8), and overall security risk moderate (0.4). Further analysis of the external library and environment is recommended."

      "conclusion": "The code functions as a heavily obfuscated, potentially dangerous interactive console that can execute arbitrary user input if external conditions are met. While no explicit malware or malicious payloads are present, its structure and behavior pose moderate security risks, especially if external variables or modules are compromised or if exposed to untrusted users."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits significant obfuscation and conditional dynamic calls, which are suspicious and could be exploited for malicious purposes. While no direct malicious activity is confirmed, the structural patterns and obfuscation justify a high suspicion level. The overall risk should be considered moderate to high, warranting further investigation into the imported modules to determine if malicious behavior exists."

      "conclusion": "The code is highly obfuscated and performs unsafe low-level memory operations that could be exploited for malicious purposes such as data exfiltration or memory scraping. While no direct malicious activity is evident, its capacity for unsafe memory access and lack of validation pose significant security risks. It warrants cautious review and strict controls before deployment, especially in supply chain scenarios."

      "conclusion": "The code is highly obfuscated and interacts with system handles at a low level, which could be exploited for malicious purposes such as covert data handling or stream hijacking. However, no direct malicious activity is evident from this fragment. The overall security risk is moderate, and the malware likelihood is low to moderate. Further contextual analysis is recommended before deployment."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign environment validation code with obfuscated variable names. No malicious activity or security risks are evident. The obfuscation is likely intended to obscure variable names but does not imply malicious intent. The scores are consistent with the analysis, with malware score 0, obfuscation score around 0.7, and low security risk."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation and low-level manipulation of Python internals, indicative of potentially malicious or covert behavior. While no direct malicious activity is confirmed, the suspicious API calls and obfuscation warrant treating this code as highly suspicious and potentially malicious."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is highly risky due to its capacity to execute arbitrary, untrusted scripts, combined with obfuscation and internal API manipulation. While no explicit malicious payloads are present, its design enables malicious exploitation. It should be treated as potentially malicious, requiring strict validation, sandboxing, or removal in security-sensitive environments."

      "conclusion": "The code is highly obfuscated and employs techniques common in malicious payloads, such as dynamic code execution, API manipulation, and core function redefinition. These behaviors indicate a high likelihood of malicious intent, warranting cautious handling and further detailed analysis. The scores are consistent with the observed behaviors and the potential security risks involved."
