  "conclusion": "The code is highly obfuscated and performs unsafe low-level memory operations that could be exploited for malicious purposes such as data exfiltration or memory scraping. While no direct malicious activity is evident, its capacity for unsafe memory access and lack of validation pose significant security risks. It warrants cautious review and strict controls before deployment, especially in supply chain scenarios."
