  "purpose": "The code appears to perform environment checks, specifically verifying the operating system and Python version.",
  "sources": "Reads data from platform.system() and sys.version_info.major",
  "sinks": "Raises RuntimeError with formatted messages based on environment conditions",
  "flows": "Source: platform.system() and sys.version_info.major -> Condition checks -> Sink: raise RuntimeError",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code detected. The code solely performs environment validation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys and platform modules, then defines boolean flags for Windows OS and Python 2. Environment validation functions are provided that raise exceptions if conditions are not met. The logic is straightforward and intended to restrict execution to Windows with Python 2. No suspicious or malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements environment validation checks to ensure the script runs only on Windows and Python 2. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this fragment.",
