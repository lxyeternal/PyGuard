{
  "purpose": "The code performs environment validation by checking if the OS is Windows and if Python version is less than 3, raising RuntimeError if conditions are not met.",
  "sources": "platform.system() and sys.version_info.major are read to determine OS and Python version.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external communications are present; the code only raises exceptions based on environment conditions.",
  "flows": "Source functions (platform.system(), sys.version_info) flow into conditional checks that may trigger exceptions, but no data flows to external systems or network.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are obfuscated, which could be an attempt to hide intent, but no malicious or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward environment validation script that checks for Windows OS and Python version < 3. It raises RuntimeError if conditions are not met. No network activity, data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are present. Obfuscated variable names are used but do not impact functionality or indicate malicious intent. The logic is benign and typical for environment gating. The absence of malicious behaviors or security vulnerabilities suggests a very low security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign environment validation code with obfuscated variable names. No malicious activity or security risks are evident. The obfuscation is likely intended to obscure variable names but does not imply malicious intent. The scores are consistent with the analysis, with malware score 0, obfuscation score around 0.7, and low security risk.",
