{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform environment checks to verify that the operating system is Windows and that the Python version is below 3.",
  "sources": "platform.system() and sys.version_info.major",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data is sent, stored, or used in a potentially malicious way",
  "flows": "The source functions feed into conditional checks that may raise exceptions if conditions are not met",
  "anomalies": "The variable names are obfuscated and non-descriptive, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code actions are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions: one to check if the OS is Windows and raises an error if not, and another to check if Python version is less than 3 and raises an error if not. The use of obfuscated variable names suggests an attempt to obscure intent, but the actual logic is straightforward environment validation. No external data is fetched, transmitted, or processed. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs environment validation checks without engaging in malicious activities or exposing security risks. The obfuscated variable names are suspicious but do not indicate malicious intent.",
