  "purpose": "The code appears to perform environment checks, specifically verifying the operating system is Windows and that the Python version is Python 2.",
  "sources": "platform.system(), sys.version_info.major",
  "sinks": "raise RuntimeError with environment-specific messages",
  "flows": "platform.system() and sys.version_info.major are checked and used to conditionally raise exceptions",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or backdoors. No obfuscated code, malicious behaviors, or suspicious network activity. The checks are straightforward and environment validation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions that verify if the script is running on Windows and if Python version is 2.x. It raises exceptions if conditions are not met. No data is leaked, no network activity, and no suspicious code execution is observed. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs simple environment validation checks. There is no indication of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It is likely intended to restrict execution to Windows systems with Python 2.",
