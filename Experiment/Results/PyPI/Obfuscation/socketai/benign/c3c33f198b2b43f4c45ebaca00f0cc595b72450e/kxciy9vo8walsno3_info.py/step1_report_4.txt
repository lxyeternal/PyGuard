  ],
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward environment validation with no suspicious or malicious behavior. It raises errors if conditions are not met, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys and platform modules to determine the OS and Python version. It sets flags based on whether the system is Windows and if Python version is less than 3. The functions raise RuntimeError if the environment does not meet specific criteria (non-Windows or Python 3+). There is no code injection, data leakage, or malicious activity detected. The code does not perform any external network activity, file modification, or stealth behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple environment validation script enforcing platform and Python version requirements. There are no signs of malicious intent or malware. It acts as a safeguard to prevent execution in unsupported environments.",
