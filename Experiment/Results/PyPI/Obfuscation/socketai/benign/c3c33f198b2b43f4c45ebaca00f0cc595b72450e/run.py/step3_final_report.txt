  "purpose": "Obfuscated function that manipulates console support via win_unicode_console.",
  "sources": "Import of 'runner' from 'win_unicode_console', usage of obfuscated function 'WHXZ...'.",
  "sinks": "Call to 'runner.WHXZdtebBOboBybqOaknTupoGBPAmZYi()' which could perform system or console modifications.",
  "flows": "Import -> obfuscated function call -> potential system or console setup.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of function and variable names, use of 'del' on a global variable, no clear purpose for the obfuscated function.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an obfuscated function that deletes a global variable and calls a function from a legitimate library, 'win_unicode_console'. The obfuscation and variable deletion are tactics often used to hinder analysis. The external library is legitimate, but the specific function called is opaque. No malicious network, file, or data operations are evident. The obfuscation suggests an intent to conceal, which could be benign or malicious. The code's purpose appears to be related to console handling, but obfuscation raises suspicion. The overall behavior is benign but warrants further inspection of the external library and environment.",
  "conclusion": "The code employs obfuscation tactics typical of malicious scripts but does not exhibit direct malicious actions. The external library is legitimate, but the obfuscated function call warrants caution. Malware score is low (0.3), obfuscation high (0.8), and overall security risk moderate (0.4). Further analysis of the external library and environment is recommended.",
