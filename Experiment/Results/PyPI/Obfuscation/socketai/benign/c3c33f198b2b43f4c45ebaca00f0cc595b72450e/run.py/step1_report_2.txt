{
  "purpose": "The code appears to execute a function from an imported module, likely for console or terminal manipulation.",
  "sources": "The import statement from 'win_unicode_console' and the function call 'runner.WHXZdtebBOboBybqOaknTupoGBPAmZYi()'.",
  "sinks": "The function call 'runner.WHXZdtebBOboBybqOaknTupoGBPAmZYi()' which may execute code within the 'win_unicode_console' library.",
  "flows": "Import of 'win_unicode_console' -> calling 'runner.WHXZdtebBOboBybqOaknTupoGBPAmZYi()' from the module",
  "anomalies": "The function name 'GbNywjxslmmhIWlKgmsNdrhJVQMFwBLm' is obfuscated; the use of 'del' on the global variable appears unnecessary; the function name and variable names are nonsensical, indicating obfuscation. The imported function 'WHXZdtebBOboBybqOaknTupoGBPAmZYi' is also nonsensical.",
  "analysis": "The script defines an obfuscated function that deletes its global variable, then calls a function from an external module. The external module 'win_unicode_console' is known for console manipulation. The function 'WHXZdtebBOboBybqOaknTupoGBPAmZYi' could be a legitimate method for console setup or, in malicious cases, could be used to modify console behavior or inject code. The obfuscated naming pattern suggests an attempt to hide malicious intent or evade detection. However, without executing or inspecting the external 'win_unicode_console' library, no definitive malicious behavior can be confirmed. The script itself does not perform network activity, file modification, or other suspicious actions, but the obfuscation and function call warrant caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated and imports a legitimate-looking library 'win_unicode_console'. It calls an obscure function from that library. Without additional context or inspecting the external module, the script itself does not show direct malicious activity but uses obfuscation techniques that are common in malicious code. The overall risk is low to moderate but warrants further investigation of the external library and function.",
