  "conclusion": "The code employs obfuscation tactics typical of malicious scripts but does not exhibit direct malicious actions. The external library is legitimate, but the obfuscated function call warrants caution. Malware score is low (0.3), obfuscation high (0.8), and overall security risk moderate (0.4). Further analysis of the external library and environment is recommended."
