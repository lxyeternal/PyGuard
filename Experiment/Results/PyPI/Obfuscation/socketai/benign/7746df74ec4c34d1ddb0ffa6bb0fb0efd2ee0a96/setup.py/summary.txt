  "conclusion": "The setup script is largely benign, with suspicious but non-malicious obfuscated attribute names. No active malware or malicious behavior is evident. The anomalies should be flagged for further investigation, especially if these attributes are used elsewhere, but based on static analysis, the package appears safe."
