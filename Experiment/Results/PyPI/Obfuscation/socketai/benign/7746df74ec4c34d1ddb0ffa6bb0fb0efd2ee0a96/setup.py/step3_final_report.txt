  "purpose": "Static package setup configuration for a Python library, defining dependencies, entry points, and metadata.",
  "sources": "Package metadata fields, including name, version, install_requires, entry_points, classifiers, python_requires, and anomalous attributes with random strings.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data processing; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "N/A – static data declaration, no dynamic data flow or external input handling.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of two non-standard, random-looking attribute names ('PUHgjTvrVRUEsYerIwXezthdCnRhQeCe' and 'XvqXdtsBBBWRbuLNUDwJwlXFuDbpXzDd') with string values, which are not recognized by setuptools and appear obfuscated.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with additional arbitrary attributes that are suspicious due to their non-standard naming. No code execution, network activity, or data leaks are present. The anomalies suggest possible obfuscation but do not demonstrate malicious intent. Malware score is 0, reflecting no active malicious behavior. Obfuscation suspicion is moderate (0.3-0.4), and overall security risk is low (0.2-0.3). These anomalies warrant further review but do not currently indicate malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is largely benign, with suspicious but non-malicious obfuscated attribute names. No active malware or malicious behavior is evident. The anomalies should be flagged for further investigation, especially if these attributes are used elsewhere, but based on static analysis, the package appears safe.",
