  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Standard modules, environment variables, user input, network/file/system calls.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network communication, file operations, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Sources to sinks via data processing functions, system calls, or network transmissions.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code, no obfuscation, no suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic eval/exec.",
  "analysis": "All reports either lack code or describe benign scripts with standard behavior. Malware and obfuscation scores are zero, aligning with the absence of malicious indicators. Security risk scores are low (0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal concern given the limited information. Confidence levels are high where code is present, justified by detailed reasoning. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected across reports.",
  "conclusion": "The code in all reports shows no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or significant security vulnerabilities. The scoring is consistent with the analysis, and no adjustments are necessary.",
