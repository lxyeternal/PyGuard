{
  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script that imports a module 'trans', reads a README file, and calls setup() with static metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' in binary mode; importing 'trans' module and accessing 'trans.__version__'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or network operations; no data leaks or malicious code execution observed.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.rst' (source) without further use; accessing 'trans.__version__' (source) used in setup parameters (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; reading README file without utilizing its content; no malicious code or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with obfuscated variable names. It reads a README file unnecessarily and imports a module 'trans' to access its version. No network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration is present. Obfuscation may be to hide intent but does not imply malicious behavior. Malware score is 0, as no malicious actions are evident. Obfuscation score is moderate (~0.45) due to variable naming, but not necessarily malicious. Security risk is low (~0.2).",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a package setup script with obfuscated variable names. No malicious activity or vulnerabilities are detected. Obfuscation alone does not indicate malicious intent; scores reflect a low threat level.",
