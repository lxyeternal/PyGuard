  "purpose": "Import specific functions from a local module and define an export list for a Python package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module, and the __all__ list.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that handle untrusted data; no data leakage or external network operations.",
  "flows": "Import from the module 'dataframe' to make certain functions available, no data flow involving external inputs or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of what appear to be obfuscated or intentionally obscure variable/function names (zbsTQoTvqoWraPywlrrvwfweAwwgFHSY, iMgivHFXZPYTLAHVYoLWjMRsXvgyluTi), which may suggest concealment or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two functions from a relative module 'dataframe', with suspiciously complex and nonsensical names, possibly indicating obfuscation. It then defines __all__ to expose only two strings, which are typical for defining API exports. There are no suspicious network calls, data handling, or security-sensitive operations. The obfuscated names could be an attempt to conceal malicious functionality, but on their own, they do not confirm malicious intent. The code is minimal and does not perform any actions beyond imports and exports.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward module import and export setup, but the use of obscure, nonsensical names raises some suspicion of obfuscation. No evidence of malicious behavior or security risks is present based solely on this fragment. The overall risk is low.",
