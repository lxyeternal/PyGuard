  "purpose": "Import specific functions from a local module called 'dataframe' and define the public API of the module.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .dataframe for functions zbsTQoTvqoWraPywlrrvwfweAwwgFHSY and iMgivHFXZPYTLAHVYoLWjMRsXvgyluTi.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data sources or sinks are evident in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only involves static imports and an export list without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "The imported function names 'zbsTQoTvqoWraPywlrrvwfweAwwgFHSY' and 'iMgivHFXZPYTLAHVYoLWjMRsXvgyluTi' are obfuscated or nonsensical, which is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two functions with highly obfuscated or randomly generated names from a local module, which is unusual. The '__all__' list indicates the module intends to expose 'DataframeError' and 'get_dataframe', but these are not imported here. The obfuscated function names could be an attempt to hide malicious code or obscure malicious intent. The code itself is minimal, but the use of non-descriptive names suggests suspicious activity, such as hiding malicious functions or backdoors. No external data sources, environment variables, or suspicious behaviors are visible in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign in structure but suspicious due to the obfuscated function names, which could be an attempt to conceal malicious functionality. Without additional context, this is a point of concern.",
