{
  "purpose": "The code is setting up an import statement from a local module and defining an export list for a package, likely related to DataFrame handling.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .dataframe indicates reading the module's namespace or file system for the 'dataframe' module; the __all__ list is static and predefined.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network calls, file writes, or eval statements are present that could process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The import flow is straightforward, importing specific functions or classes; the __all__ list is static, not influenced by untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "The imported identifiers 'zbsTQoTvqoWraPywlrrvwfweAwwgFHSY' and 'iMgivHFXZPYTLAHVYoLWjMRsXvgyluTi' are unusually obfuscated, likely randomly named, which could indicate attempts to hide malicious intent or code obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a standard import statement and an __all__ declaration. The imported names are highly obfuscated, which is atypical and could suggest malicious intent or concealment. No dynamic code execution, user input handling, or network activity is present. The static __all__ list indicates explicit control over exported symbols. The obfuscated import identifiers are suspicious as they seem deliberately obscure, potentially hiding malicious code or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal but contains suspiciously obfuscated identifiers, which may be an attempt to hide malicious code or backdoors. There is no immediate evidence of malicious activity, but the obfuscation warrants caution and further review of the referenced module.",
