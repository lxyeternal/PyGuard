  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Dynamic imports, eval/exec, untrusted input handling, network or system calls, environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission, file writes, subprocess executions, eval/exec with untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Sources such as untrusted input or dynamic imports to sinks like network, file, or eval/exec execution points.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation, dynamic code execution, untrusted eval/exec usage, ambiguous data flows, absence of code in some reports.",
  "analysis": "The reports indicate that Report 1 exhibits obfuscation and dynamic code execution, which are signs of potential malicious intent, warranting a malware score of 0.5 and obfuscation score of 0.7. Report 2 uses eval/exec with untrusted data but lacks obfuscation, justifying a malware score of 0.4 and obfuscation score of 0.0. Reports 3 and 5 lack code, thus scores are zero, indicating no assessment possible. Report 4 shows benign code with no suspicious patterns, scoring low risk. The scores across reports are generally consistent with the described behaviors, with slight adjustments recommended for Report 1 to better reflect the suspicion level.",
  "conclusion": "The current scores are appropriate and aligned with the analysis. Report 1's obfuscation and dynamic execution justify higher suspicion, and its malware score is slightly increased to 0.5. Other reports' scores are consistent with their descriptions. No further adjustments are necessary.",
