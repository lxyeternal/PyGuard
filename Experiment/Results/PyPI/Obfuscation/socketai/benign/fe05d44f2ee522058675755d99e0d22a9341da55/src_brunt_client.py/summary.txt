  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated SDK managing sessions and device interactions. There is no direct evidence of malicious behavior, but the obfuscation and network activity suggest caution. Scores are set to reflect low malware likelihood, high obfuscation, and moderate security risk due to concealment techniques."
