  "purpose": "Setuptools setup script to configure package installation with SCM versioning",
  "sources": "import statement from setuptools, use of setup() function, exception handling",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data processing or external communication",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks; setup() is called without external input",
  "anomalies": "Empty except block with only a print() call that produces no output; no other anomalies",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() with a specific version scheme, wrapped in a try-except block. The except block contains an empty print statement followed by a re-raise, which is redundant and does not perform any malicious action. No user input, external data, or network operations are present. The structure appears to be a standard setup script with minimal error handling, and no suspicious behavior or obfuscation is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for Python package configuration with no malicious intent or suspicious activity. The empty print statement is unnecessary but harmless. Overall, it poses no security risks.",
