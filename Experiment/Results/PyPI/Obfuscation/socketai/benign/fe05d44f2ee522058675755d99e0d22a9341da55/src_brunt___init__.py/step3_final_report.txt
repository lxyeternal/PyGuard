  "purpose": "Obfuscated package setup and metadata retrieval, with dynamic import handling and local module imports.",
  "sources": "Import statements, dynamic package info retrieval, local module imports",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no network, file, or data exfiltration observed",
  "flows": "Import of obfuscated symbol -> instantiation with __name__ -> exception handling -> deletion of symbols -> local module imports",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names, import of symbol with a random name, deletion of imported symbols, no visible documentation or comments",
  "analysis": "The code employs obfuscated variable names and dynamic import handling, which suggests an attempt to conceal its purpose. It retrieves package metadata with a potentially dynamically injected symbol, handles missing packages gracefully, and cleans up imported symbols. The local imports are also obfuscated, but no malicious network activity, file operations, or code execution are evident. The obfuscation pattern raises suspicion but does not demonstrate malicious intent. The low malware score (0.2) aligns with the absence of explicit malicious actions. The high obfuscation score (0.75) reflects the heavily obfuscated naming conventions. The moderate risk score (0.3) accounts for potential concealment but no active threats. Overall, the code appears to be an obfuscated setup or plugin module without malicious behavior, but obfuscation warrants continued vigilance.",
  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated but does not exhibit signs of malicious activity based on the provided snippet. The current malware score of 0.2, obfuscation score of 0.75, and risk score of 0.3 are appropriate. Further review of the imported modules and overall context is recommended to ensure no hidden malicious logic exists.",
