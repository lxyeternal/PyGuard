  "purpose": "Request management classes with session validation and request handling, including both sync and async implementations.",
  "sources": "Input data dictionaries, request URLs constructed from host and path, session cookies, environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Network requests via requests or aiohttp, response JSON parsing, cookie validation, header construction.",
  "flows": "Data from input dictionaries flows into request payloads and headers, then to network requests, with cookie/session validation occurring before requests.",
  "anomalies": "Use of placeholder variable names and constants, some obfuscated or nonsensical identifiers, minimal validation logic, potential incomplete code.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a framework for HTTP request handling with session and cookie management, supporting both synchronous and asynchronous operations. No signs of malicious payloads, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. The obfuscation and placeholder variables suggest incomplete or intentionally confusing code but do not indicate malicious intent. The request flow and response handling are standard, with cookie expiry checks and request construction following typical patterns. The malware score is appropriately set to 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2), consistent with a request framework without active vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, if somewhat obfuscated, HTTP request and session management framework with no evidence of malicious behavior. The assigned scores are justified; malware is absent, obfuscation is moderate, and overall security risk is low.",
