  "purpose": "Define an enumeration for HTTP methods with obfuscated class and member names",
  "sources": "Class definition and enumeration members",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow points, as the code only defines constants",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is static",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and member names; no meaningful identifiers; no other unusual patterns",
  "analysis": "The code declares an Enum class with obfuscated names, mapping members to HTTP method strings. There is no user input, network activity, or data processing. The obfuscation appears to be for concealment rather than malicious behavior. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials beyond enum values, and no external data handling are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward enum definition with obfuscated naming, likely intended for concealment. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. The only concern is potential obfuscation, but it is benign in this context.",
