  "purpose": "Define an enumeration for HTTP methods with obfuscated enum member names",
  "sources": "The code imports the Enum class and defines an enum class with string values representing HTTP methods",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, data output, or potential data leak points observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; enum members are static string values",
  "anomalies": "Enum member names are highly obfuscated and nonsensical, suggesting potential concealment of intent; no other anomalies detected",
  "analysis": "The code creates an enumeration class with intentionally obfuscated member names mapped to standard HTTP method strings. There are no input sources or runtime data manipulations. The obfuscation could be intended to hide the purpose or avoid detection, but the code itself is straightforward and static.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be an obfuscated enumeration of HTTP methods, with no malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation alone does not indicate malicious intent, but it warrants caution if used in security-sensitive contexts. Overall, low suspicion.",
