{
  "purpose": "Defines an obfuscated enumeration of HTTP methods (POST, GET, PUT) using Python's Enum class.",
  "sources": "Static class members with string values representing HTTP methods.",
  "sinks": "No data input, output, or external data handling; no untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "N/A - static constants; no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated member names that conceal their purpose; no dynamic code or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static Enum class with obfuscated member names mapping to standard HTTP method strings. There are no inputs, outputs, or runtime behaviors. The obfuscation appears solely in naming, not in functionality. No evidence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation is consistent with concealment but does not imply malicious intent. The malware score is 0, security risk is very low (~0.1), and obfuscation is high (~0.8). The confidence in these assessments is high (~0.8-0.9).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static enumeration with obfuscated member names. There is no malicious activity or security risk detected. The obfuscation appears to be for concealment, not malicious purposes. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
