  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, obfuscated documentation build script with no evidence of malicious activity. The obfuscation and dynamic import of 'brunt' are notable but do not constitute a threat in their current form. The malware score is 0, the obfuscation score is high (~0.75), and the overall security risk is low (~0.2). Continuous monitoring is recommended if used in sensitive environments."
