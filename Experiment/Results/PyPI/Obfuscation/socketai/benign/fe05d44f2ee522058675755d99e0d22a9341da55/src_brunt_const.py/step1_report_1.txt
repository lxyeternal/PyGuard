  "anomalies": "The variable names are obfuscated, containing seemingly random strings. There is no actual code logic, function calls, or data processing present; only variable assignments. No secrets, credentials, or suspicious hardcoded data are directly visible. The code's purpose is unclear, but no malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable assignments of URLs, strings, and a dictionary defining URL components. The obfuscated variable names suggest an attempt to hide intent, but no executable logic, data handling, or network activity is present. Without context or function calls, this appears to be a configuration snippet or part of a larger codebase. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malicious payloads, or suspicious activities in the provided fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a configuration or data declaration with obfuscated variable names. It does not contain any executable logic or malicious code. Based on this fragment alone, there are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It likely serves as part of a larger system for network communication.",
