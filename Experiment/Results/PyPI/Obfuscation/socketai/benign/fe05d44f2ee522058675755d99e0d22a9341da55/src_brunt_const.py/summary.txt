  "conclusion": "The code is purely declarative configuration data with heavily obfuscated variable names but no active or malicious behavior. Based on the analysis, there is no evidence of malware or malicious intent. The obfuscation warrants some caution, but the overall security risk is low. The appropriate scores are malware: 0.0, obfuscated: 0.8, security risk: 0.2."
