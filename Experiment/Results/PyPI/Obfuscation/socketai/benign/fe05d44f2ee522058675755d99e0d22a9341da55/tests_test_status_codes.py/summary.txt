  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit concrete malicious behavior but contains obfuscation and insecure credential handling that pose moderate security risks. No evidence of malware such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or cryptomining is present. The primary concerns are related to insecure practices rather than active malicious payloads."
