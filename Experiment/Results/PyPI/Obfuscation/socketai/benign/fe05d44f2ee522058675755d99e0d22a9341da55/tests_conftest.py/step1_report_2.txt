  "purpose": "The code appears to define the source encoding for a Python script, indicating that it is intended to handle Unicode characters properly.",
  "sources": "No data input sources are present in this code fragment.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data output points present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or data processing paths are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of a coding declaration comment; it lacks any executable code, imports, functions, or data handling. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are observable.",
  "analysis": "This is a minimal, standard Python file header specifying UTF-8 encoding. It contains no executable logic, data input/output, or potentially malicious constructs. Since it is just an encoding declaration, there are no security concerns or malicious behavior to evaluate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple encoding declaration with no executable or malicious content. It poses no security risks.",
