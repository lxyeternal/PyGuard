The obfuscation and dynamic import of 'brunt' are notable but do not constitute a threat in their current form. The malware score is 0, the obfuscation score is high (~0.75), and the overall security risk is low (~0.2). Continuous monitoring is recommended if used in sensitive environments."

      "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated but does not exhibit signs of malicious activity based on the provided snippet. The current malware score of 0.2, obfuscation score of 0.75, and risk score of 0.3 are appropriate. Further review of the imported modules and overall context is recommended to ensure no hidden malicious logic exists."

Based on the analysis, there is no evidence of malware or malicious intent. The obfuscation warrants some caution, but the overall security risk is low. The appropriate scores are malware: 0.0, obfuscated: 0.8, security risk: 0.2."

The obfuscation appears to be for code concealment or auto-generation, not malicious activity. The malware score should remain at 0.0, the obfuscation score around 0.6-0.7, and the overall security risk low (~0.2)."

      "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated SDK managing sessions and device interactions. There is no direct evidence of malicious behavior, but the obfuscation and network activity suggest caution. Scores are set to reflect low malware likelihood, high obfuscation, and moderate security risk due to concealment techniques."

No evidence of malware such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or cryptomining is present. The primary concerns are related to insecure practices rather than active malicious payloads."
