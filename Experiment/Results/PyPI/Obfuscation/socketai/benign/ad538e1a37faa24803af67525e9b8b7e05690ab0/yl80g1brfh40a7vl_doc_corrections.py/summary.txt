  "conclusion": "The code appears to be primarily for data normalization and augmentation, with obfuscation that warrants further review of the external dependency. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The scores assigned are consistent with the analysis, but caution should be exercised regarding the external function/class used for ID generation."
