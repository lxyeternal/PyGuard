{
  "purpose": "The code handles DID string validation, parsing, and schema management, likely as part of a DID-related library or system.",
  "sources": "Pattern matching on DID strings, external function calls (e.g., afhJFCiWIWcEGNxgSpSJldiFkLYpIGEo.UevzLJWMRMwjUpqefvfrGhJuepLuMWtk), and class properties accessing internal state.",
  "sinks": "External function calls that could perform network communication, data exfiltration, or system modifications, especially the external methods invoked within methods like HEldOrAFYGwOExhneGbceWgvEwpnzxoC and uQYAeiNUUFiZBYyBHCInUjoeouKmuXJB.",
  "flows": "Input DID strings are validated and parsed via regex; internal state is set; external functions are invoked with internal data, potentially transmitting or processing data externally.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with non-descriptive class and variable names; dynamic pattern matching; external functions with unknown implementations; no hardcoded secrets or explicit malicious payloads visible.",
  "analysis": "The code is heavily obfuscated, making understanding difficult. It performs DID validation and schema handling, which appears legitimate. However, the external function calls and obfuscation suggest potential concealment of malicious behavior. No explicit malicious payloads, such as network connections or data leaks, are evident. The external functions could be benign or malicious, but their unknown behavior warrants caution. The high obfuscation score reflects the difficulty in analysis and potential concealment. The malware score remains low (0.2), indicating suspicion but no confirmed malicious activity. The risk score is moderate (0.4), mainly due to external dependencies and obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated DID validation library with external dependencies that could perform network or system operations. No explicit malicious activity is confirmed, but the obfuscation and external calls justify cautious review. Further investigation into the external modules and runtime behavior is recommended before trusting or deploying this code.",
