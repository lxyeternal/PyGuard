  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated DID validation library with external dependencies that could perform network or system operations. No explicit malicious activity is confirmed, but the obfuscation and external calls justify cautious review. Further investigation into the external modules and runtime behavior is recommended before trusting or deploying this code."
