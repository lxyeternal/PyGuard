  "purpose": "URL handling and validation for DID URLs, including parsing, schema generation, and construction.",
  "sources": "Input strings in __init__, class methods accepting URL strings, regex matching, URL parsing via urlparse.",
  "sinks": "URL string reconstruction, attribute assignments, string conversions, regex validation functions.",
  "flows": "Input string -> regex/validation -> URL parsing -> attribute setting -> URL reconstruction or validation functions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names, complex inheritance, dynamic method calls, and string manipulations without external calls or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs URL parsing, validation, and construction for DID URLs, using regex and standard URL parsing. Obfuscation is present but appears to serve as a concealment tactic rather than malicious intent. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are evident. The regex validation is standard, and the URL handling is typical for such utilities. The obfuscation and complexity increase suspicion but do not confirm malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a benign URL utility for DID URLs with obfuscation that could be intended to hinder reverse engineering. There is no evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious activity. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score should be set to 0. The obfuscation score remains high due to naming and structural complexity, but this does not imply malicious intent.",
