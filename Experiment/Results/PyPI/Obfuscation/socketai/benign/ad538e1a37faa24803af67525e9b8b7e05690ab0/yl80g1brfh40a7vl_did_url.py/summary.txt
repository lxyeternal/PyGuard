  "conclusion": "The code functions as a benign URL utility for DID URLs with obfuscation that could be intended to hinder reverse engineering. There is no evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious activity. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score should be set to 0. The obfuscation score remains high due to naming and structural complexity, but this does not imply malicious intent."
