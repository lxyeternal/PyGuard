  "purpose": "Define regex patterns for DID (Decentralized Identifier) strings and compile some regexes for parsing specific URI components.",
  "sources": "Regex pattern definitions and compilation; hardcoded string patterns",
  "sinks": "Regex compilation, no external data or untrusted input processing present",
  "flows": "Pattern strings are compiled into regex objects, no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks observed",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names, but no malicious or suspicious code behavior or secrets detected; no dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a regex pattern for DID strings, compiles additional regexes for URI parsing, and defines a custom exception class with a string attribute. All regex patterns are hardcoded and straightforward. No input handling, no network operations, or sensitive data processing observed. The variable naming is unconventional but does not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscation or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign utility for regex pattern setup related to DID strings and URI parsing, with no malicious behavior or security risks evident.",
