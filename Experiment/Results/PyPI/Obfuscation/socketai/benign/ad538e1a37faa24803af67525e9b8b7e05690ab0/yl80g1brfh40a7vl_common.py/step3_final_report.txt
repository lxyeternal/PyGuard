  "purpose": "Define regex patterns for DID strings and URI components, compile regex objects, and declare a custom exception class.",
  "sources": "Regex pattern definitions, class attribute string, and pattern compilation statements.",
  "sinks": "No data flow from untrusted sources, no external input handling, network or file operations.",
  "flows": "Pattern definitions and class attribute are static; no data flows from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names, references to undefined variable 'DID_REGEX', and a class attribute string that could be a secret.",
  "analysis": "The code defines regex patterns for DID identifiers and URI components, compiles regex objects, and creates an exception class with an obfuscated name. Variable names are intentionally obscure, which could be an attempt at concealment but do not indicate malicious behavior. The pattern referencing 'DID_REGEX' is undefined in the snippet, suggesting incomplete code or obfuscation. The class contains a string attribute that might be a secret or token, but there is no evidence of malicious activity such as network communication, code injection, or data exfiltration. Overall, the code appears to be a benign utility module for regex pattern setup, with obfuscation and incomplete references being points for review but not malicious in themselves.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a utility for regex pattern compilation related to DID parsing, with obfuscated variable names and some incomplete references. No evidence of malware or malicious intent is present. The obfuscation and missing variable should be reviewed in the context of the larger codebase, but based on this snippet alone, the security risk is minimal.",
