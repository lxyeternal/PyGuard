  "purpose": "Define regular expressions for DID (Decentralized Identifier) parsing and a custom exception class.",
  "sources": "Regex pattern definitions and class declaration. The regex patterns compile DID-related strings, and the class defines an exception with a string attribute.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted input or lead to data leakage or execution vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines patterns and a class without any data processing or I/O.",
  "anomalies": "The variable names are obfuscated and not descriptive, which could be a sign of concealment, but no malicious activity or backdoors are apparent. The regex patterns seem legitimate for DID parsing.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a regex pattern for DID formats, compiles two regex objects, and a class extending Exception with a class variable. The patterns and class do not perform any operations or input handling. No suspicious or malicious code is present; obfuscated variable names alone are not sufficient to indicate malicious intent. There are no data flows, external inputs, or harmful operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate setup for DID parsing and exception handling. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The obfuscated variable names are suspicious but not malicious in themselves. Overall, the code is benign.",
