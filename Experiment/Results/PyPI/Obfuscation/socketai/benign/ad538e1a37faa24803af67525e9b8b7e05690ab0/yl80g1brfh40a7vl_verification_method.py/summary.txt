  "conclusion": "The code is a sophisticated, obfuscated cryptographic and DID data model module with no signs of malicious activity. The obfuscation is likely for IP protection or code complexity, not malicious sabotage. The current malware score should remain at 0, with a moderate obfuscation score (~0.6) and low security risk (~0.2)."
