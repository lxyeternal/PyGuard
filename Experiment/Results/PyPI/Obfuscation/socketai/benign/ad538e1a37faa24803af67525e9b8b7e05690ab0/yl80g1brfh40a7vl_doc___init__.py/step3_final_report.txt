{
  "purpose": "The code imports classes and functions from internal modules 'builder' and 'doc', and defines an export list for DID-related classes and errors.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from internal modules, no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling; no network or file operations present.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows; purely static imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated or nonsensical class/function names, which may be placeholder or auto-generated identifiers.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module setup with static imports and an export list. The identifiers are obfuscated, which could be for protection or placeholder purposes. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or external communication. The obfuscation alone does not imply malicious intent but warrants caution. The malware score is zero, consistent with the absence of malicious activity. The obfuscation score is high, reflecting the naming pattern. The security risk score is low, given the lack of external data handling or network activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard module with obfuscated internal identifiers, likely auto-generated or intentionally obscured. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities in this fragment. The obfuscation should be monitored, but the overall security posture is minimal.",
