{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific classes or functions from local modules 'builder' and 'doc' and defines an __all__ list for public API exposure.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules: .builder and .doc",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow paths are present; no untrusted data processing or output is evident",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code primarily involves static imports and exports",
  "anomalies": "Use of non-descriptive, obfuscated-looking identifiers (e.g., DuMyjLFOPhtLpsPThxIzsQLcbYiYefyq), which might suggest obfuscation or attempt to hide intent",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes or functions with obfuscated names from local modules, which could be an attempt to conceal malicious intent. The __all__ list exposes these components publicly, but there are no operations, data handling, or logic that could directly be malicious. The presence of obfuscated identifiers warrants caution, but given the limited scope—just imports and export declarations—there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this fragment. It appears to be standard module setup with possible obfuscation intended for hiding code complexity or for other reasons.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily composed of import statements with obfuscated identifiers, which could be suspicious but do not demonstrate malicious activity by themselves. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident in this fragment, though the obfuscation should be noted as a potential concern.",
