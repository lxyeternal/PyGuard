{
  "purpose": "This code imports specific classes or functions from local modules and defines a list of public API names for a DID (Decentralized Identifier) document handling library.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from relative imports of modules named 'builder' and 'doc'. No external input sources are directly used in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or output functions that handle untrusted data or perform data transmission, file writing, or system modification.",
  "flows": "There are no data flow paths involving untrusted sources leading to sinks within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "All identifiers appear to be obfuscated or intentionally named with nonsensical strings, which may be an attempt to hide code intent. No explicit malicious activity such as network calls, file operations, or data exfiltration is visible.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various classes or functions from local modules and sets an __all__ list to expose specific names. There are no external inputs, no data processing, and no apparent execution logic. The obfuscated names could be benign or an attempt at concealment, but there is no concrete evidence of malicious behavior or security flaws based solely on this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward module interface definition with obfuscated internal identifiers. No malicious or security-threatening behavior is evident from this snippet. However, the obfuscated identifiers warrant caution if further code reveals hidden functionality.",
