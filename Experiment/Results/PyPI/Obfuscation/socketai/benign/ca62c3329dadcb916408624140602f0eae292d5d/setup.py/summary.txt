  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with a minor oddity in exception handling. No malicious activity, malware, or obfuscation is detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: ~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. The overall security risk is negligible."
