  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package using setuptools, possibly with SCM versioning.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from setuptools import setup' and the use of 'setup()' within the main block.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code only invokes setup functions without handling external input.",
  "flows": "The code calls setup() with a version scheme; there are no data flows from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The except block contains an empty print statement which does nothing and raises the exception again; no malicious anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py used for packaging. It attempts to run setup() with a specific version scheme, and in case of failure, it raises the exception after an empty print statement. The empty print statement is a redundant operation but not malicious. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious network activity, or obfuscated code present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign and serves a packaging purpose without any malicious intent.",
