  "conclusion": "The code is primarily for testing or data setup in a bioinformatics context. While obfuscation is significant, there is no active malicious behavior detected. The overall security risk is low, with a very low malware likelihood. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not justify blocking or flagging as malicious."
