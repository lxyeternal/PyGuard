{
  "purpose": "The code performs environment setup by checking Python version, importing modules with obfuscated names, handling missing packages, and importing local modules. It appears designed to manage dependencies and compatibility across different Python versions.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info for version check; importlib modules with obfuscated names; exception handling for missing packages; local module imports",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, network operations, or data leaks are present in the code",
  "flows": "Version check leads to conditional import; import attempts invoke obfuscated modules; exception handling assigns default values; imported symbols are deleted; local modules are imported at the end",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated module and variable names; dynamic import handling; deletion of imported symbols; no clear malicious payloads or network activity",
  "analysis": "The code employs obfuscation likely to conceal internal module names and manage compatibility across Python versions. It handles missing dependencies gracefully and cleans up imported symbols, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No evidence of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection, is present. The obfuscation raises suspicion but could be for proprietary or packaging reasons. The exception handling and import cleanup are consistent with environment setup rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily environment and dependency management with obfuscation that could be intended to hide internal details. There is no evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not justify high malware or security risk scores. Overall, the code appears benign, with low risk and malware scores appropriate.",
