  "purpose": "Import necessary modules and handle package dependencies for SingleCellExperiment functionality.",
  "sources": "Reading the Python version info from sys.version_info, importing modules and handling exceptions, importing specific functions and classes from local modules.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; no network or file output or data leakage observed.",
  "flows": "sys.version_info -> conditional import -> exception handling -> variable assignment -> import from local modules",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names (e.g., mzqawOFpgiEJdIkSQOELblmMWfsyllGY, SHFyNWrgHbXOkacNmPQFVYGbfLEglfas, dwMTvDuposOVfZEbfJPXDDSiUzZKKqSz), dynamic import paths, use of try/except for dependency handling, deletion of imported names.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by checking Python version to conditionally import modules, which are heavily obfuscated with nonsensical names. It attempts to import 'PackageNotFoundError' and another object from an obfuscated module or package, which could be part of an obfuscated or malicious module. If the import fails, it defaults to a string 'unknown'. It then imports specific functions and classes from local modules, likely part of the package itself. The obfuscated naming and dynamic import handling could be designed to hide malicious intent or to evade static analysis. There are no network operations, data leaks, or suspicious system modifications evident. The code appears to be typical dependency handling with obfuscation, which raises suspicion but does not necessarily indicate malicious intent. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code injection is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily handles dependency imports with obfuscated variable names and conditional logic, which could be an attempt to hide malicious intent or evade detection. However, there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior, network activity, or data leaks in this snippet. The obfuscation and dynamic import handling warrant caution, but without further malicious indicators, the risk appears low.",
