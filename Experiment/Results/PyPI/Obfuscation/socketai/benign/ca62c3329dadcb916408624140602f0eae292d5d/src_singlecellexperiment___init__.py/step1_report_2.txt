  "purpose": "Import modules and handle optional dependencies related to SingleCellExperiment",

  "sinks": "Variable assignment, exception handling, module imports",
  "flows": "sys.version_info → conditional import; import statements → variable assignment; exception handling → variable assignment",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated import names (e.g., RkXhLMoDOsiSoYYhbBSxtFjRQGhJbnKu, dwMTvDuposOVfZEbfJPXDDSiUzZKKqSz), dynamic import logic, deleting imported symbols, no explicit user input",
  "analysis": "The code checks Python version to decide which import to use for PackageNotFoundError and dwMTvDuposOVfZEbfJPXDDSiUzZKKqSz. The module names are intentionally obfuscated, which could be benign or suspicious. The code then attempts to instantiate dwMTvDuposOVfZEbfJPXDDSiUzZKKqSz with a string argument; if not found, sets a variable to 'unknown'. It then deletes imported symbols, potentially to hide usage. Finally, it imports internal modules, including a class or function from SingleCellExperiment. No external data, user input, or network activity is involved. The obfuscated names and deletion of symbols could be an attempt to obscure behavior, but no malicious actions such as data exfiltration or system modification are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs conditional imports based on Python version with obfuscated module names and manages exceptions to set a variable. It deletes imported symbols afterward, which might be an attempt to conceal details but does not directly indicate malicious intent. No malicious behavior or malware is evident from this snippet.",
