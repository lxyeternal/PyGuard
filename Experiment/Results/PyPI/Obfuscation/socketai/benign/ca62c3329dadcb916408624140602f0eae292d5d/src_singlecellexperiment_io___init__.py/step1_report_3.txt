{
  "purpose": "Import specific functions or classes from local modules within the package.",
  "sources": "Imports from .h5ad and .tenx modules, potentially reading code or data definitions.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no data output or external connections present.",
  "flows": "Imports bring in functions/classes for use within the package; no data flow or external influence evident.",
  "anomalies": "Imported names are obfuscated or nonsensical, which could be a sign of hiding malicious intent. The code does not follow conventional naming, raising suspicion about the purpose of these imports.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements importing from relative modules. The imported names are nonsensical, which is unusual and potentially indicative of obfuscation or malicious intent. There are no input or output operations, network calls, or data processing visible. The absence of comments or documentation makes it harder to determine intent, but the obfuscated identifiers merit concern. The code by itself appears benign but suspicious due to obfuscated identifiers. No malware behavior is directly observable in these import statements, but the obfuscation warrants further review of the modules being imported.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs simple relative imports with obfuscated names, which is unusual and could be a tactic to hide malicious code or intent. On its own, it does not contain malicious behavior but raises suspicion. Further inspection of the imported modules is recommended to confirm safety.",
