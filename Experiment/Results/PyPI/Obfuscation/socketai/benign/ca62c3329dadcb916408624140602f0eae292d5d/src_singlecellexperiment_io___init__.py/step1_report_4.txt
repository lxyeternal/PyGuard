  "purpose": "Import specific functions or classes from local modules 'h5ad' and 'tenx'.",
  "sources": "Import statements reading from local modules in the same package.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks or external data flows identified.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; only static imports are present.",
  "anomalies": "Imported names are seemingly random strings; no documentation or context provided. No code execution or dynamic behavior is observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two import statements importing specific identifiers with non-descriptive, seemingly random names from local modules. There is no visible logic, data processing, or external interactions. The unusual naming could be an obfuscation attempt or just arbitrary naming. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or code execution. The code is minimal and static, with no indicators of malicious intent or suspicious anomalies beyond unusual naming.",
  "conclusion": "The code only performs static imports with non-descriptive names, which alone does not indicate malicious behavior. The lack of further code, data flow, or external interaction suggests this is a standard import statement with obfuscated or placeholder identifiers. No malware or security risks are evident from this fragment.",
