  "purpose": "Import specific functions or classes from local modules within the package.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing 'bYdZkNinHKYHTkZLxoQQjWVkqPjcdOxo' from '.h5ad' and 'iRYuunkBsAMAZzDraXXXYxSBaXJEQnrn', 'LcVYNqQOLuHImngohFsISKUpfGLzzkLa' from '.tenx'.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly, as the code only performs imports.",
  "flows": "Imports are static; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Unusually named modules and functions/classes with obfuscated-looking identifiers; no clear documentation or context. No usage of dynamic import or eval.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two import statements importing members with seemingly obfuscated names from local modules. There are no functions, data processing, or network operations. The module names and member names do not reveal malicious intent explicitly. The unusual naming could be obfuscation, but this alone does not indicate malicious behavior. There are no input sources, sinks, or data flows that suggest malicious activity. No evidence of malware or security issues from these statements alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard local imports with obfuscated identifiers. No malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks are evident from these lines. The unusual naming warrants further review of the imported modules themselves, but based solely on this snippet, the code appears benign.",
