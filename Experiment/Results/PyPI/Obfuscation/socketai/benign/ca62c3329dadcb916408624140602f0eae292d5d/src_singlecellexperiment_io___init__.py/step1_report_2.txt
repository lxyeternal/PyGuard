  "purpose": "Import specific functions or objects from local modules within a package.",
  "sources": "Import statements sourcing functions or objects from .h5ad and .tenx modules.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; imports are static and do not involve untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external untrusted sources to sensitive operations; merely imports.",
  "anomalies": "Imported identifiers are obfuscated, consisting of random strings, which is unusual but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static imports from local modules using seemingly random, obfuscated names. These names do not appear to be meaningful or human-readable, which can sometimes suggest obfuscation. However, the code does not execute any dynamic code, network operations, or handle untrusted input. There are no hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious behaviors evident. The use of local relative imports is standard in package modules, though the naming conventions are suspiciously obfuscated. Without further context, there is no clear evidence of malicious intent. The code is minimal and straightforward, focused on imports.",
  "conclusion": "The code only performs static imports with obfuscated identifiers from local modules. No malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity is evident from these statements alone. The obfuscated names are unusual but do not indicate malware or security risks.",
