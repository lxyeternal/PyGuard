  "purpose": "Static import of modules with obfuscated identifiers, likely for data processing or functionality extension.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules '.h5ad' and '.tenx' with obfuscated names.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; static imports do not lead to data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow or dynamic execution; only static module imports with obfuscated identifiers.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated, nonsensical identifiers for imported functions/classes; no additional code or logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static relative imports from local modules with obfuscated names, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks are evident. The obfuscated names suggest possible code hiding or auto-generation, warranting further review of the imported modules. Malware scores are justified as zero due to lack of malicious behavior; obfuscation scores are high (~0.75) reflecting suspicion; security risk scores are low (~0.15) as static imports alone are not dangerous.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign in isolation but the obfuscated identifiers merit further review of the imported modules. No evidence of malicious activity is present, and the overall security risk remains low.",
