  "purpose": "Import specific functions or classes from local modules within the package",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules '.h5ad' and '.tenx'",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; the code imports functions or classes which could potentially be used elsewhere",
  "flows": "Not explicitly shown in the code snippet; potential usage of imported components occurs outside this snippet",
  "anomalies": "Imported names appear as random, nonsensical strings, which could be obfuscation or autogenerated; no apparent normal naming conventions",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions or classes with obfuscated or nonsensical names from local modules. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are involved in this snippet. The import statements themselves are straightforward, but the nonsensical names could be suspicious if they are used maliciously or if they are obfuscated to hide malicious intent. Without further context, these could be benign or malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet performs straightforward imports with obfuscated names, which alone do not confirm malicious behavior but warrant caution. There is no evidence of malware or malicious activity within this code fragment, but the unusual naming suggests a need for further review of the imported modules.",
