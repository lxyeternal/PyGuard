{
  "purpose": "This code defines a setup configuration for a Python package, including reading metadata files and passing parameters to the setup() function for package distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading from files: README.rst, CHANGES.rst, version.txt; static string definitions within setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function uses the gathered data to configure package metadata; no direct untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "File content is read into variables and then used as arguments in setup(), without transformation or execution of untrusted code.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names are used throughout the script, which is unusual for standard setup scripts. No explicit hardcoded secrets (beyond the package key) are detected. The string 'k093plx11nrjwxyl' appears as a package key but seems static and not necessarily malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup configuration tasks: reading metadata files and passing them to the setup() function with specified parameters. Variable names are intentionally obfuscated, which might suggest an attempt to hide intent or complexity, but no malicious behavior or obfuscation techniques like code execution, dynamic imports, or hidden backdoors are present. The script does not perform network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration. All data flows are from static files or strings into setup configuration. The obfuscation appears superficial, possibly to hinder straightforward understanding but does not indicate malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup configuration with obfuscated variable names. No evidence of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks is found. The obfuscation is superficial and not malicious. The code appears safe and intended for package distribution purposes.",
