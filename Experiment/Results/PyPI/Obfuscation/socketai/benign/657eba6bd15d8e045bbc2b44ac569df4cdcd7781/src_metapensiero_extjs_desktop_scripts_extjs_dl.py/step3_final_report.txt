  "purpose": "This code is a minimal UTF-8 encoding declaration comment with no executable logic.",
  "sources": "There are no input sources or data reads; the code contains only a comment line.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows are present, as there is no executable code or data processing.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows exist due to the absence of operational code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious constructs, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is solely a comment specifying UTF-8 encoding, with no variables, functions, or data operations. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate given the lack of executable or suspicious content. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The code's minimal and standard format confirms its harmlessness.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign UTF-8 encoding declaration comment with no malicious or security concerns. All reports and scores are consistent and appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
