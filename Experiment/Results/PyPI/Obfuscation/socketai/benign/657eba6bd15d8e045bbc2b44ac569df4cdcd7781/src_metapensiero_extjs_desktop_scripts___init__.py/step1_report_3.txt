  "purpose": "The code is a source file with a UTF-8 encoding declaration but contains no executable code or logic; it appears to be an empty or placeholder script.",
  "sources": "No data sources, inputs, or data reading functions present.",
  "sinks": "No output functions, data sinks, or potential data leak points present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths since the code contains no executable statements.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of only a UTF-8 encoding declaration without any functional code is unusual but not inherently malicious; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a coding declaration line and no actual logic, functions, or data handling. Its structure suggests it is an incomplete or placeholder script. No suspicious behaviors, code injections, or malicious activities are present. The lack of code minimizes any security risk or malicious potential.",
  "conclusion": "This is an essentially empty script with only an encoding declaration; no malicious intent or security risks are evident based on the provided content.",
