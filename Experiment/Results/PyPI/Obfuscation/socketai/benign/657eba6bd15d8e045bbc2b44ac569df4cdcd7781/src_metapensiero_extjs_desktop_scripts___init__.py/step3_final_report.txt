  "purpose": "The code is a minimal Python script containing only a UTF-8 encoding declaration, likely serving as a placeholder or header.",
  "sources": "No data sources; the file contains only a comment line specifying encoding.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points; no sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code does not process any data.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, data handling, or suspicious constructs; only a declaration comment.",
  "analysis": "The code is solely a UTF-8 encoding declaration with no executable logic, data sources, or sinks. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the content. Confidence levels vary but are justified given the minimal, benign nature of the file.",
  "conclusion": "The file is a benign placeholder with no security risks, malicious intent, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the scoring aligns with the content. No further action is necessary.",
