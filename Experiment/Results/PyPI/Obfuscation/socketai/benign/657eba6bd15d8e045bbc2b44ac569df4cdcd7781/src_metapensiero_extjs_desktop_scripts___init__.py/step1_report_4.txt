  "purpose": "The code appears to be a minimal Python script with only a coding declaration, not performing any specific function.",
  "sources": "There are no data input sources such as user input, environment variables, or network calls.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks such as data output, file writing, network transmission, or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "No data flow is present due to the absence of executable statements or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The only content is a coding declaration comment, which is standard and harmless; no suspicious or unusual code present.",
  "analysis": "The code contains solely a coding declaration comment indicating UTF-8 encoding. No executable code, data reads, or potentially malicious constructs are present. The file is essentially empty aside from the encoding declaration, which does not introduce any security risk or malware potential.",
  "conclusion": "This is a trivial file with no executable content or suspicious elements. It poses no security threat or malware risk.",
