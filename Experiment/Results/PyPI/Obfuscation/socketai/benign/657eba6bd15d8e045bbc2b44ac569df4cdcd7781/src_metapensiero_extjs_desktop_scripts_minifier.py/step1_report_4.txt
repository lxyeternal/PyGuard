  "purpose": "The code provides functions for compressing JavaScript files and converting relative URLs in CSS to absolute paths.",
  "sources": "Reading JavaScript files from disk in hvjxgQHOTCouDCsyAjxVUNepaWSqAmmC, reading CSS content in absolutize_css_urls.",
  "sinks": "Writing compressed JS to output file in hvjxgQHOTCouDCsyAjxVUNepaWSqAmmC; no other direct sinks for untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Input files are read, optionally stripped of debug comments, minified, and written to output files. CSS URLs are transformed based on provided maps.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a suspicious try-except block with a nonsensical exception assignment (EEGLYLXscYexMqaSUtWbHJngWmgBkysw). The exception handling may mask errors or obfuscate logic; no meaningful exception handling is present. The regex for URLs and debug comments appear benign. No hardcoded credentials or secret leaks are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code performs file reading, content modification, and file writing for JavaScript and CSS files. The try-except block with a variable assigned to IOError inside an exception handler is suspicious but not malicious—likely obfuscated or placeholder code. The regex is used for stripping debug comments and URL matching, both straightforward. There is no evidence of network activity, system manipulation, or data exfiltration. The overall structure seems typical for asset processing scripts, with no hidden or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign asset processing script with no indications of malicious intent or malware. The only anomaly is a suspicious try-except block with nonsensical exception assignment, possibly obfuscation or placeholder code. Overall security risk is low.",
