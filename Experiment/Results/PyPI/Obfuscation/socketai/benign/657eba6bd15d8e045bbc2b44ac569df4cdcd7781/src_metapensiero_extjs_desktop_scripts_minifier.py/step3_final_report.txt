  "purpose": "Asset processing: minifying JavaScript and CSS, and rewriting relative URLs to absolute paths.",
  "sources": "Reading JS and CSS files from disk, input parameters for file paths, CSS URL references.",
  "sinks": "Writing minified JS to output file, potential modification of CSS URL references.",
  "flows": "Reading files -> processing content (minification, URL rewriting) -> writing output files.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, suspicious try-except block referencing an undefined variable, superficial obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard asset minification and URL adjustments. The try-except block with an undefined variable 'EEGLYLXscYexMqaSUtWbHJngWmgBkysw' raises a NameError caught as IOError, which appears to be obfuscation or placeholder code. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. The obfuscation is superficial and likely intended to hinder static analysis but does not serve malicious purposes. The functions are safe, and the overall behavior aligns with benign build pipeline utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign asset processing utility with superficial obfuscation. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or active malware is detected. The obfuscation appears to be a placeholder or concealment tactic rather than malicious intent.",
