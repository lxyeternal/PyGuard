  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: importing `extend_path` from `pkgutil` and applying it to `__path__`.\n- The purpose across reports is to support namespace packages.\n- No external inputs, data sinks, or network operations are involved.\n- The code is minimal, standard, and uses well-known Python patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code is straightforward and performs a common pattern for namespace package support.\n- No malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscation are evident.\n- The code does not contain any errors, flaws, or suspicious logic.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- None identified. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this pattern.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n  - `confidence`: 1\n- These scores seem appropriate given the code's benign and standard nature.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since the code is a standard namespace package pattern, the risk scores should remain at zero.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks justify increasing the scores.\n\n### Potential assumptions or claims:\n- No assumptions are made that could be challenged; all reports correctly interpret the code.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All reports are consistent with each other and with the code's purpose.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a typical namespace package extension pattern with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The code is benign, standard, and safe.\n- No modifications to the scores are necessary.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is a routine namespace package support snippet with no malicious intent.",
