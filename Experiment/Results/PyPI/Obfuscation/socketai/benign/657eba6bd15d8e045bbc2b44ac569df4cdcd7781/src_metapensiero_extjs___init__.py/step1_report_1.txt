  "purpose": "Extend the package's __path__ for namespace package support.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __path__ variable and the __name__ variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only modifies __path__.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses extend_path from pkgutil, which is common in namespace packages but can be misused to hide malicious modules. However, in this context, it appears benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and leverages standard Python practices for namespace package extension. It does not contain any suspicious or malicious logic. There are no input sources, data sinks, or data flows indicating malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The use of extend_path is typical for supporting namespace packages, and no malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for extending package paths in namespace packages, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
