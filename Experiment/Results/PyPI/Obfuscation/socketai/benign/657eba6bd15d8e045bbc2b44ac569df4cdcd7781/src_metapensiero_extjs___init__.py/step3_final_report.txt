  "purpose": "Support for namespace packages by extending __path__ using pkgutil.extend_path.",
  "sources": "Import of extend_path from pkgutil, application to __path__ variable.",
  "sinks": "None; no data sinks, network operations, or external data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code simply modifies __path__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is a standard pattern for namespace support, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports extend_path from pkgutil and applies it to __path__, a common pattern for supporting namespace packages in Python. It involves no external inputs, data leaks, or malicious behavior. All reports correctly identify this as a benign, standard pattern with no security issues. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate given the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a routine, benign implementation for namespace package extension. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk present. All reports are accurate and consistent, and the scores are justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
