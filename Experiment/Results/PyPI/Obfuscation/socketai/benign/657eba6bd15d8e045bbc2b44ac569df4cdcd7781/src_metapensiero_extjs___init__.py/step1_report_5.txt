  "purpose": "The code is used to extend the module's search path for package resources.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module's __path__ variable and the __name__ identifier.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is used to influence critical operations or data leaks.",
  "flows": "The code manipulates the __path__ variable but does not process external or untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses extend_path from pkgutil in a minimal way; no anomalies or hidden behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports extend_path from pkgutil and extends the module's __path__ variable, which is a common pattern for packages that need to include resources from multiple locations or handle namespace packages. There are no suspicious operations, hardcoded secrets, or malicious instructions. The snippet is a standard package configuration and does not indicate malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a benign operation related to package resource management. It does not contain malware or security risks. The likelihood of malicious behavior is very low.",
