  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Use of extend_path for namespace package extension is common in namespace packages, not inherently suspicious",
  "analysis": "The code imports extend_path from pkgutil and uses it to extend __path__, which is typical for namespace packages to include additional directories. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. No external inputs or untrusted data sources are involved. The purpose appears to be module path extension without any malicious intent or security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace package pattern and does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks.",
