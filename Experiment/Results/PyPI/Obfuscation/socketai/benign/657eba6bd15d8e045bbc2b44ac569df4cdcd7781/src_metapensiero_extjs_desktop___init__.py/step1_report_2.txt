  "purpose": "The code is a simple UTF-8 encoding declaration, typically used to specify character encoding for Python source files.",
  "sources": "There are no input sources or data reads in this code.",
  "sinks": "There are no sink functions or operations that handle untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a coding declaration and no executable logic, no anomalies or suspicious activity.",
  "analysis": "This is a minimal, standard encoding comment indicating the source file uses UTF-8 encoding. There is no executable code, input/output operations, or data handling. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely as a character encoding declaration with no malicious or security risks.",
