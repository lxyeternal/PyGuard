  "purpose": "The code specifies encoding but does not perform any functional operations.",
  "sources": "No data input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output functions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow is present due to lack of executable code.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a file encoding declaration with no executable statements or logic.",
  "analysis": "The provided code consists solely of a coding declaration specifying UTF-8 encoding. There are no functions, variables, data reads, or external interactions. Without additional code, there are no sources, sinks, or flows. This minimal snippet does not pose any security risks, nor does it contain malware or obfuscation. It appears to be a part of a larger file or a placeholder comment.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is harmless, containing only a UTF-8 encoding declaration with no malicious behavior or security concerns.",
