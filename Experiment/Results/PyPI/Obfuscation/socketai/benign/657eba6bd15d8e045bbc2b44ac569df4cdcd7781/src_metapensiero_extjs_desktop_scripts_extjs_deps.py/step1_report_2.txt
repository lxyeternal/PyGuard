  "purpose": "The code is a comment indicating the encoding used in the Python source file.",
  "sources": "The encoding declaration itself does not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow can be established from the provided code.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of a coding declaration comment; there are no active code or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is a single comment specifying the source file encoding as UTF-8. This is a common practice in Python files to define character encoding but does not include executable code, input reading, or data processing. Since no additional code is provided, there are no signals of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard encoding declaration comment with no harmful content.",
