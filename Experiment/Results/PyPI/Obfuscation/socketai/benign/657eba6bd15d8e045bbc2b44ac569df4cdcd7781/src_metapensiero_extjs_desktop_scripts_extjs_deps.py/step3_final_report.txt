  "purpose": "This code snippet contains only a UTF-8 encoding declaration with no executable code or data flow.",
  "sources": "No data sources; only a comment line declaring encoding.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the code is purely declarative with no runtime logic.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, input/output, or suspicious constructs; minimal placeholder.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single encoding declaration comment with no functional or malicious code. All reports correctly identify the lack of executable content, data flow, or obfuscation. Scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately zero, reflecting the benign and placeholder nature of the snippet. Confidence in benign assessment is high due to the minimal content. No anomalies or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is harmless, containing only a declaration comment. It poses no security risk or malicious intent. The scores are consistent with the content, and no further action is necessary.",
