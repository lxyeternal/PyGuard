{
  "purpose": "This code extends the module's search path using pkgutil's extend_path, likely for namespace package support.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code simply modifies __path__.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for namespace packages; no anomalies or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports extend_path from pkgutil and updates __path__ with extend_path, which is typical in namespace packages. There are no hardcoded secrets, malicious logic, or suspicious behavior. The code is concise and follows standard practice for package extension, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for namespace package support and shows no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
