{
  "purpose": "Extend the package's __path__ to support namespace packaging or multiple distributions.",
  "sources": "The code reads the special variable __path__ (likely provided by the import system) and the module name __name__.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted input or data flows to external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code simply modifies __path__ using extend_path.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses 'pkgutil.extend_path' which is common in namespace packages; no suspicious or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and standard for supporting namespace packages in Python, using 'pkgutil.extend_path'. It reads and modifies the __path__ variable to include additional directories for package resolution. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks. The code does not contain hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or network activity. It appears to be boilerplate setup code for a package's namespace support.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and intended for package namespace extension. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
