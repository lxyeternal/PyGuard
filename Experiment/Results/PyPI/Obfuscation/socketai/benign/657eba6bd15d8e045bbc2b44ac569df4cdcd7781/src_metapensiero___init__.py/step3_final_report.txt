  "purpose": "Extend the __path__ variable for namespace package support, allowing multiple distributions to contribute to the package namespace.",
  "sources": "Import of extend_path from pkgutil, usage of __path__ variable.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks or external data processing.",
  "flows": "Assignment of __path__ to extend_path(__path__, __name__), modifying the package search path.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is minimal, straightforward, and standard for namespace packages.",
  "analysis": "The code imports extend_path from pkgutil and assigns __path__ to extend_path(__path__, __name__), a common pattern in Python namespace packages. It does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or contain obfuscated or malicious code. All reports correctly identify this as standard, benign code with no malicious intent. The security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscated scores are appropriately zero. The slight risk score (0.1) reflects the potential misuse of path extension but is justified given the context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard pattern for supporting namespace packages, with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. All assessments are accurate, and the security posture is benign. No adjustments to scores are necessary.",
