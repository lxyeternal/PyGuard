  "purpose": "Extend the module's search path to include additional directories or packages.",
  "sources": "The '__path__' variable which is used to modify the module search path.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data processing or external data sinks detected.",
  "flows": "No data flow involving untrusted input to sensitive operations; the code only modifies internal path variables.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'pkgutil.extend_path' could be suspicious if malicious code manipulates package paths, but in this context, it's standard for namespace packages; no other anomalies observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'extend_path' from 'pkgutil' and reassigns '__path__' using 'extend_path'. This pattern is typical for namespace packages to combine multiple directories into a single package namespace. No input sources or data sinks are present. No malicious or unusual code patterns are detected. The code appears to be a legitimate implementation for package namespace extension.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for extending package paths in namespace packages with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
