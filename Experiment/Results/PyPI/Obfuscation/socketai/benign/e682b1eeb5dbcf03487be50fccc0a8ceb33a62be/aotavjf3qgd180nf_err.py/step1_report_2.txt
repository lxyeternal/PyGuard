  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class named sGzyjRETZBHvDCJPXfXZPGkJixcMHUUC",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; class declaration only",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external interactions present",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths; class is only a custom exception definition",
  "anomalies": "The class name appears to be a random string, which may suggest obfuscation or intentionally obscure code, but this alone is not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a custom exception class with a non-descriptive, seemingly random name. There are no external data reads, no dangerous operations, and no suspicious behavior. It does not perform any malicious actions such as network communication, file access, or data manipulation. The absence of any executable logic, inputs, or outputs indicates it is just a class definition. The unusual class name could be a sign of obfuscation, but without additional context, it is not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple class definition with no malicious behavior or security risks. The unusual class name may indicate obfuscation, but this does not imply malicious intent.",
