  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class named sGzyjRETZBHvDCJPXfXZPGkJixcMHUUC",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external interactions present",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths",
  "anomalies": "Class name appears obfuscated, but it is simply a custom exception; no malicious indicators",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a class declaration for a custom exception that inherits from Python's Exception class. There are no input sources, data flows, or suspicious code behavior. The class name is obfuscated, but this alone is not indicative of malicious intent. There are no operations, network calls, or data leaks present.",
  "conclusion": "This code defines a single, straightforward custom exception class with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscated class name is a minor anomaly but not suspicious in this context.",
