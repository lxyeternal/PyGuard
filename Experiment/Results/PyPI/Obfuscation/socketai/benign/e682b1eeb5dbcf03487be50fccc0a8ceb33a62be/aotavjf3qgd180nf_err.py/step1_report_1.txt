{
  "purpose": "Custom exception class definition, likely used for error handling in a larger application.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as data output, network transmission, or system modifications present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths evident in the code.",
  "anomalies": "The class name appears to be a random string, which could suggest obfuscation or obfuscated naming. No other suspicious behavior or code activities observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class inheriting from Python's built-in Exception. The class name 'sGzyjRETZBHvDCJPXfXZPGkJixcMHUUC' is a nonsensical, random string, which may indicate obfuscation or an attempt to hide the purpose. However, there is no code execution, data leakage, or malicious behavior present. The code snippet is minimal and standard for custom exception declaration, with no suspicious activity or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward custom exception class with a randomly generated name. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The obfuscated name alone is not sufficient to suggest malicious behavior, but it might be part of an obfuscated codebase.",
