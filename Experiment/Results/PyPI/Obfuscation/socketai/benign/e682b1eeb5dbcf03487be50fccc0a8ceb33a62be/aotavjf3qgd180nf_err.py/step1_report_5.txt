  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class named sGzyjRETZBHvDCJPXfXZPGkJixcMHUUC",
  "sources": "No input or data reading in this code",
  "sinks": "No data output or untrusted data handling in this code",
  "flows": "No data flow as there are no executable statements or data processing",
  "anomalies": "Class name appears obfuscated or randomly generated; no other suspicious activity",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single custom exception class inheriting from Exception, with an obfuscated class name. There are no data sources, sinks, or flows present. The code is minimal and standard for defining a custom exception but the class name appears intentionally obscure, which could suggest obfuscation or attempt to hide intent. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malicious payload, or suspicious code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple custom exception class with an obfuscated name. It contains no malicious behavior, no data leaks, and no security issues. The obfuscation of the class name alone does not indicate malicious intent, especially given the simplicity of the code.",
