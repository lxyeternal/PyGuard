  "conclusion": "The code is utility-oriented with no signs of malware or malicious behavior. The primary security concern is the potential misuse of subprocess execution with untrusted inputs. Therefore, malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk should be around 0.4 to 0.5, depending on context. Proper input validation is recommended to mitigate risks."
