{
  "purpose": "Assignment of a version string to a variable, likely for version control or configuration.",
  "sources": "The right-hand side string '3.1' is a static literal, not derived from external input.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources are present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code simply assigns a value to a variable.",
  "anomalies": "The variable name appears obfuscated or nonsensical, which is unusual and could indicate obfuscation. However, there is no active code or logic to analyze beyond this assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a variable assignment with an obscure variable name. There are no inputs, outputs, or operations performed. No suspicious patterns, such as data leaks, network activity, or malicious commands, are evident. The only anomaly is the variable name, which might suggest obfuscation, but this alone does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and appears to be a simple assignment statement with obfuscated variable naming. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
