  "purpose": "Assigns a version string '3.1' to an obfuscated variable name, likely for internal use or concealment.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of a string value to a variable; no external inputs or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or external interaction present.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable name; no other anomalies or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple static assignment with an obfuscated variable name. No malicious behavior, network activity, or data leaks are evident. The obfuscation may be for concealment but does not imply malicious intent. The malware score is 0, consistent with the benign nature. The obfuscation score is moderate (~0.5), reflecting the nonsensical variable name. The security risk score is 0, indicating no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign, consisting solely of a static assignment with obfuscated naming. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. The obfuscation is likely for concealment but does not constitute malicious behavior in this context.",
