  "purpose": "Assigns a string value '3.1' to a variable with an obfuscated name.",
  "sources": "Assignment statement assigning a constant string to a variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to external functions or outputs.",
  "flows": "N/A - only a single variable assignment with a constant string.",
  "anomalies": "The variable name appears obfuscated, which could be a sign of concealment, but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single variable assignment with an obfuscated variable name. There are no input reads, data processing, or external interactions. The string '3.1' may represent a version number or configuration parameter. No malicious behavior, external communication, or suspicious patterns are present. The obfuscated variable name alone is not indicative of malicious intent but could be used to hide malicious logic in a broader context.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a simple variable assignment with an obfuscated variable name and does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks on its own. It lacks any malicious actions or data leaks.",
