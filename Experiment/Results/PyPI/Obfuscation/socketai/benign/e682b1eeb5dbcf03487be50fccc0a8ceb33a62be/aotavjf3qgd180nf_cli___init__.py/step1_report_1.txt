  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a specific function, but the actual intent is unclear without the code content.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input functions, environment variables, or files; specific sources are not visible in the prompt.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, file writes, or system commands, but cannot be identified without the code content.",
  "flows": "Source-to-sink paths are not determinable without explicit code; typically involve data from inputs passing to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are observable from the provided information; the code content is missing, preventing detection of unusual patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "Insufficient information to analyze; the prompt does not include the actual code snippet. Without code content, it's impossible to identify sources, sinks, flows, anomalies, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Unable to determine malicious behavior or security risks due to lack of code content. More details are required for a thorough review.",
