  "purpose": "This code appears to perform data processing and possibly interacts with external services or user input, but the specific purpose is unclear without detailed context.",
  "sources": "Input functions, environment variables, or external data loading points (if present). Since no code is provided, assume standard input or environment variable reads.",
  "sinks": "Data outputs, network connections, file writes, or system commands if present.",
  "flows": "Input sources funnel into processing functions, with outputs possibly sent to external services or stored locally.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies detected due to lack of specific code. Need detailed inspection of code content.",
  "analysis": "The prompt provides no code snippet for review. Based on guidelines, I cannot identify specific source, sink, flow, or anomalies. No suspicious or malicious code behaviors can be confirmed without code details. The review would require analyzing actual code for hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "Insufficient code detail to definitively identify malicious behavior. No clear evidence of malicious intent or security risks based on the provided prompt. Further code details are necessary for thorough analysis.",
