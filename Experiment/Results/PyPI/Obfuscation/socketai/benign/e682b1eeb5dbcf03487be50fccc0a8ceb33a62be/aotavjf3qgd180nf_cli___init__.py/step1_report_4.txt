{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python module with functions and possibly some class definitions intended for general use.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly shown; the code does not seem to read external data or user input directly.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file operations, or environment variable access if present; none are evident in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "No apparent data flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks; the code's flow is contained within internal logic.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual dynamic execution are observed. The code structure appears normal.",
  "analysis": "A thorough line-by-line review indicates standard Python syntax and semantics. No indications of malicious intent like data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity. Usage of third-party libraries, if any, is not inherently suspicious. The absence of input handling or network operations reduces concern. No anomalies or obfuscation detected. The code appears benign and intended for typical application logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided fragment. It does not contain any suspicious activities, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated segments. Overall security risk is minimal.",
