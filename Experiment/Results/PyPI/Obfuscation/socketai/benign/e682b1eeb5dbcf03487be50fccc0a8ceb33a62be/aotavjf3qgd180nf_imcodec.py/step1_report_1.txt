{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to serialize an image to bytes and deserialize bytes back into an image object.",
  "sources": "Input: an image object (KDxqeXpjeUFvVqeFJkmUAXQtRGqgMsTx), Output: bytes representing PNG image (JxLMcevZBPDqgiqDpOSRiVtHkfvnYESE)",
  "sinks": "The functions output image bytes and read image bytes into an image object; no external or untrusted data sources are directly used",
  "flows": "Image object -> serialize to bytes -> output; bytes -> read into image object -> output",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; functions perform standard image serialization/deserialization",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions: one converts an image object to PNG byte data, the other reconstructs an image from byte data. The functions use io.BytesIO for in-memory byte streams. No external data sources, network activity, or suspicious logic are present. No obfuscation or malicious behavior detected. The variables are obfuscated but consistent within the functions, serving standard image handling purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard image serialization/deserialization with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears benign and intended for image data handling.",
