{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to serialize a PIL Image object into PNG bytes and deserialize PNG bytes back into a PIL Image object.",
  "sources": "The functions read image objects for serialization and byte data for deserialization.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write to external sources or perform any network or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Image object passed to serialization function, resulting in byte data; byte data passed to deserialization function, resulting in an image object.",
  "anomalies": "Variable and function names are obfuscated, but no suspicious or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard image serialization/deserialization using PIL and io.BytesIO. No external data sources, network activity, or hardcoded secrets are involved. Obfuscation is limited to variable names, which does not imply malicious intent. The functions are straightforward and correctly implemented, with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing typical image handling routines. Obfuscation of variable names is present but not malicious. No evidence of malicious activity or security risks is detected.",
