  "conclusion": "The script's main concern is the insecure dynamic execution of external code, which could be malicious if 'about.py' is compromised. While no active malicious behavior is evident, the pattern is risky. The obfuscation and exec usage warrant caution, and the package should not be trusted until 'about.py' is verified. The overall malware score is set to 0.3, reflecting moderate suspicion; obfuscation is high (0.75), and security risk is elevated (0.6)."
