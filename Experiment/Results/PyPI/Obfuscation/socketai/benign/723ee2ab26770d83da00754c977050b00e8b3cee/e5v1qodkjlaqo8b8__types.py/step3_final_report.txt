  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Reads from environment variables, user input; potentially uses eval/exec with untrusted data; hardcoded URLs or secrets; no obfuscation detected.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file operations, dynamic code execution via eval/exec.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input flows into eval/exec, possibly leading to code injection or execution of malicious payloads.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec with untrusted data, hardcoded secrets or URLs, signs of obfuscation, no clear purpose provided.",
  "analysis": "The code demonstrates high-risk patterns such as dynamic code execution with untrusted input and hardcoded secrets, indicating potential malicious intent. The suspicion of obfuscation is justified if variable names or code structure are intentionally obscured. No benign patterns or routines are evident. The presence of eval/exec significantly elevates security concerns, warranting a malware score above zero. The overall security risk is high due to these behaviors, and the obfuscation suspicion aligns with code complexity or obscurity. Absence of code or benign patterns in other reports is correctly reflected by zero scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high-risk behaviors, notably dynamic code execution with untrusted data and hardcoded secrets, suggesting potential malicious activity. The scores, particularly malware (~0.6), obfuscated (~0.5), and security risk (~0.6), are justified. No evidence of confirmed payloads, but the patterns warrant caution and high alert.",
