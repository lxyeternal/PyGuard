  "purpose": "A Python validation/assertion library providing various methods to enforce data correctness and object properties, with customizable error handling.",
  "sources": "Function arguments, internal method calls, error_factory, _callable, and user-provided data inputs.",
  "sinks": "Error handling routines, exception raising, and callbacks that could potentially execute arbitrary code if misconfigured.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through validation predicates; error_factory and _callable may be invoked upon validation failure, potentially executing user-defined code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected. Usage of error_factory and _callable could be misused if misconfigured, but this is standard in customizable validation libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive validation utility with multiple assertion methods, designed for runtime data validation and property checks. It employs standard patterns such as customizable error factories and callbacks, which are common and not inherently malicious. No obfuscation or malicious payloads are present. The potential risk arises from misuse of error_factory or _callable, which could execute arbitrary code if provided malicious functions, but this is a known and documented pattern. The overall structure and behavior are consistent with a benign, well-structured validation library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard validation/assertion framework with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The minimal security risk score reflects the potential for misuse of error handling callbacks, but this is not indicative of malicious behavior. The malware score is zero, and the obfuscated score is zero, confirming the benign nature of the code.",
