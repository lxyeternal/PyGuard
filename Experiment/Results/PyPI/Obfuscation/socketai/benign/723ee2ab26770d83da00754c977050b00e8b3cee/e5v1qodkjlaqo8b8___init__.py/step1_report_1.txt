  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not provided; the code appears to be empty or non-existent.",
  "sources": "No input or data sources detected in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points present.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths identified due to absence of code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is entirely absent or contains no executable content, which is unusual for a functional module.",
  "analysis": "The provided code fragment is empty or non-existent, with no detectable logic, imports, or executable statements. This could suggest either an incomplete snippet or a placeholder. Since no code is present, there are no sources, sinks, or flows to analyze. The lack of code prevents any assessment of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain any logic or data handling; therefore, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The absence of code could be a sign of an incomplete snippet or an intentionally empty module. Given the lack of content, the security risk is minimal, but the context of usage remains unknown.",
