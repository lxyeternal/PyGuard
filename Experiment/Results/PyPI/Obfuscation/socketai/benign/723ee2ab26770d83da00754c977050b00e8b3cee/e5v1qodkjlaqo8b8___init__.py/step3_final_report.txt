  "purpose": "The code appears to be a benign Python script performing data processing or system interaction without malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input functions, environment variables, module imports, file I/O, network communication, system commands",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, file system, environment variables, system commands",
  "flows": "Input sources (e.g., user input, environment variables) to sinks (e.g., network, file, system commands)",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; code is straightforward and benign",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python script with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws. It reads data from inputs or environment variables and interacts with system resources or network. No anomalies or malicious patterns are present. The code structure is clear, and the absence of suspicious features suggests low risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The risk is minimal, and the malware likelihood is zero. The overall security posture is very low risk.",
