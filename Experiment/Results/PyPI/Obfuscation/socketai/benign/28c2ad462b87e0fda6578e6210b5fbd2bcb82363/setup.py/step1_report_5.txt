  "purpose": "Set up a Python package with specific dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata and dependencies from the script itself.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; no data leakage or harmful actions evident.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows to critical functions; setup configuration is static.",
  "anomalies": "The package name 'eyga8c7qxitirvhc' appears to be a randomly generated string, which could be suspicious or indicative of obfuscation or malicious intent. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. The dependencies specify torch version >=1.12.1. The package name appears non-descriptive and potentially malicious, possibly used to obscure intent. There are no dynamic code execution, hardcoded credentials, or network interactions. The script is minimal and straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be a typical package configuration with an unusual package name. There are no direct signs of malicious code, malware, or security risks within this code snippet. The suspicious package name warrants caution if provenance or intent is unclear, but the script itself is benign.",
