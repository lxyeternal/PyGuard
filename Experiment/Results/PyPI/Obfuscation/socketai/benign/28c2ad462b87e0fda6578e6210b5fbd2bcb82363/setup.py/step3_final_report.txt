{
  "purpose": "A minimal setup script for a Python package using setuptools, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports from setuptools and uses hardcoded package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks are present; the code does not process external data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code simply calls setup() with static arguments.",
  "anomalies": "The package name 'eyga8c7qxitirvhc' appears random and non-descriptive, which could be suspicious or obfuscated but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with no dynamic or malicious behavior. The only anomaly is the package name, which is non-descriptive and could be used to obscure malicious intent, but no such behavior is evident. No code injection, network activity, or data leakage is present. The scores from reports are consistent: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk approximately 0.1-0.2 due to the suspicious name, but no actual threat. Confidence in this assessment is high (around 0.9), given the simplicity and lack of suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, representing a standard setup script with an unusual package name. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The slight security risk score reflects caution about the package name but does not indicate an active threat.",
  "malware": 0,
