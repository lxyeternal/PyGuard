  "sources": "Class hierarchy traversal (__class__.__mro__), device.type attribute, torch.get_rng_state(), torch.cuda.get_rng_state().",
  "sinks": "RNG state setting functions, potential for RNG state manipulation to influence randomness reproducibility.",
  "flows": "Input device type determines RNG state retrieval; class hierarchy check reads object class info; RNG states are set based on device, with fallback.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, recursive fallback in RNG management, but no malicious patterns or external data leaks.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard class hierarchy inspection and device-specific RNG state management using PyTorch APIs. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or hardcoded secrets. Obfuscation is limited to variable names, which does not imply malicious intent. The recursive fallback in RNG management could be a minor logic concern but is not malicious. Overall, the code appears benign, serving typical ML utility functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious activity. The obfuscation is moderate but not suspicious. The low security risk score is justified given the functions' purpose. No immediate security threats are present.",
