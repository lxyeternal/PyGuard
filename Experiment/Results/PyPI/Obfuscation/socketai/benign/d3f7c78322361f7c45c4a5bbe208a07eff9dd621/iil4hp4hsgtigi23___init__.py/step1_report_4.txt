  "purpose": "Import a specific class or function from a local module named 'highlight'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module 'highlight'.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks or data leaks; no untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; only an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The imported symbol 'ThFrVVbPStMKLwlSIsJnmQNgEFKsvbHO' appears as an obfuscated or nonsensical identifier, which could suggest obfuscation or an attempt to hide malicious intent. The module filename and import are minimal, providing no context about functionality.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a single import statement from a relative module 'highlight'. The imported symbol has an obfuscated or nonsensical name, which is unusual and may indicate obfuscation or hiding malicious intent. The code lacks any further logic, data handling, or behavior that could be analyzed for malicious activity. Since the code is minimal, there's no evidence of malware, data leaks, or security issues within this snippet. The obfuscated identifier warrants caution but could also be a legitimate, minified or auto-generated symbol.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal and only performs a local import with an obfuscated symbol name. While the obfuscated name raises suspicion about possible obfuscation, there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior or security risks within this snippet alone. Additional context from the module or related code is needed to determine intent more confidently.",
