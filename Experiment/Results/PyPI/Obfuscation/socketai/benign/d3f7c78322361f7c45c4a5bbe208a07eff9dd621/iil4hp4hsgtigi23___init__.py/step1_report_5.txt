  "purpose": "Import a specific class or object from a local module named 'highlight'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module file, potentially reading from the filesystem or package directory.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or security-sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external untrusted sources to sinks; the code only performs an import.",
  "anomalies": "The imported object has an obfuscated or non-descriptive name 'ThFrVVbPStMKLwlSIsJnmQNgEFKsvbHO', which could be an indicator of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement with a non-descriptive, seemingly obfuscated name for the imported object. There are no other code operations, data handling, or external network interactions. The obfuscated name might be suspicious, but in isolation, it could also be a legitimate obfuscated class or object used in the module. No malicious behavior or security risks are explicitly evident from this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a straightforward import with an obfuscated object name, which may indicate concealment but does not necessarily imply malicious intent. The code itself appears benign, but the use of obfuscated identifiers warrants caution if found in a broader context.",
