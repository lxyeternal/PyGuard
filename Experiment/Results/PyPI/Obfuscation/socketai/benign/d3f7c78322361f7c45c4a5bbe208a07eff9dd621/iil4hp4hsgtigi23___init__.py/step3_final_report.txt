  "purpose": "Assess the security implications of a minimal import statement with an obfuscated symbol in a Python module.",
  "sources": "The import statement from a local module (.highlight) and the obfuscated symbol name.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external interactions are present; potential concern is the obfuscated symbol which could conceal malicious code.",
  "flows": "Import from local module to symbol usage; no data flow or external network activity observed.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated symbol name 'ThFrVVbPStMKLwlSIsJnmQNgEFKsvbHO' appears nonsensical, which is suspicious but not conclusive.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, performing only a relative import with an obfuscated symbol. All reports correctly identify the obfuscation but lack evidence of malicious activity. The malware scores are low (around 0.1-0.2), appropriate given the absence of malicious behavior. The obfuscation score is high (~0.7), justified by the symbol's appearance. Security risk scores are low (~0.2), reflecting minimal threat. The confidence in the benign nature is moderate, but obfuscation warrants caution. Additional context or code would be necessary for definitive assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign in isolation but uses an obfuscated identifier, which warrants monitoring. Scores are consistent and appropriately cautious. No immediate malicious activity is evident, but further investigation into the module's purpose is recommended.",
