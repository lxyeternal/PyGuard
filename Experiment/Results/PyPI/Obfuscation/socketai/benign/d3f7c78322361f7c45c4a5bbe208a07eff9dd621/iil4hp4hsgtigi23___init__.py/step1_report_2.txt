{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be an import statement that imports a symbol from a local module named 'highlight'.",
  "sources": "The source is the local module '.highlight' and the imported symbol 'ThFrVVbPStMKLwlSIsJnmQNgEFKsvbHO'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any data sinks; it only performs an import operation.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis is applicable since this is a simple import statement with no runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "The symbol name 'ThFrVVbPStMKLwlSIsJnmQNgEFKsvbHO' appears to be a random string, which could suggest obfuscation or a generated identifier, but there is no concrete evidence of malicious intent based solely on this.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal import statement using a relative import syntax. The imported name is a long, seemingly random string, which might be generated or obfuscated. There is no indication of malicious behavior such as network activity, file modifications, or data leaks. The code is very simple and standard in Python modules, with no suspicious patterns or security risks evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import statement with an unusual symbol name. There are no signs of malware or malicious activity. The unusual symbol name could be due to obfuscation or automated code generation but does not inherently indicate malicious intent.",
