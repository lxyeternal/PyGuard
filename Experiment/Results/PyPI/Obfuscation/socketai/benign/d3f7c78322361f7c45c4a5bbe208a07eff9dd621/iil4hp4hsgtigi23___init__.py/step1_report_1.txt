  "sources": "Import statement importing from .highlight module.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling shown.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident in the provided snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual: the class/function name 'ThFrVVbPStMKLwlSIsJnmQNgEFKsvbHO' appears to be a nonsensical or obfuscated identifier, which could indicate obfuscation or malicious intent. The code is minimal and lacks context or additional logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a single class or function from a local module 'highlight'. The identifier used for import appears to be intentionally obfuscated or nonsensical, which can be a red flag for malicious code hiding its intent. There are no other operations, data handling, or external network interactions shown. The minimal nature of this snippet makes it difficult to determine malicious behavior definitively, but obfuscated identifiers often suggest concealment of malicious code or backdoors. Without further code, it’s not possible to conclude malicious activity but the obfuscation warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet is minimal but includes an obfuscated import, which could be benign or could indicate concealment of malicious code. Additional context or code is needed for a definitive assessment, but the suspicious naming warrants cautious review.",
