      "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python setup script with superficial obfuscation and a controlled use of os.system for package upload. No malicious activity or payloads are detected. The main security consideration is the pattern of executing system commands based on command-line arguments, which is standard but should be handled cautiously. Overall, the script poses minimal security risk, with no malware present."

      "obfuscated": 0.8,
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated property caching decorator with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The high obfuscation score is justified by variable naming but does not indicate malicious intent. The security risk remains minimal. All reports are accurate and consistent; no further action is necessary."
