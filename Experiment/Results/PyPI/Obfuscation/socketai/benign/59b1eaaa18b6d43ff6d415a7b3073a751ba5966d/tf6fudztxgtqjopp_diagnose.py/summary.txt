  "conclusion": "The code functions as a package inspection utility with obfuscated identifiers. There is no direct evidence of malicious behavior or malware in this fragment. The primary concern is the suspicious, obfuscated import, which could potentially hide malicious code. The malware score should be low, reflecting the lack of active malicious actions, but the obfuscation justifies a moderate security risk. Further investigation into the imported module is recommended to confirm its purpose. Overall, the code appears benign but warrants caution due to obfuscation."
