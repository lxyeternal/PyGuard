{
  "purpose": "Defines utility decorators for caching with optional cache control and conditional execution based on the first argument.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; uses functools and types modules internally.",
  "sinks": "No data leaks, network activity, or system modifications detected.",
  "flows": "Decorator functions wrap target functions; dynamic method assignment and cache usage within the decorators.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with nonsensical variable and function names; cache_clear method overridden with a no-op lambda, which is unusual.",
  "analysis": "The code provides decorators for caching and conditional execution, with obfuscated naming. No external data, network activity, or malicious patterns are present. The cache_clear override prevents cache clearing, which is suspicious but not malicious. The obfuscation could be for concealment but does not inherently indicate malicious intent. The code appears benign, serving as utility decorators. The high obfuscation score reflects the variable naming, but no malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility decorators with obfuscated names, showing no signs of malware or malicious activity. The high obfuscation warrants caution, but based on the code alone, it is benign. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2).",
