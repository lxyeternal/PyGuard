  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code with obfuscation. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The obfuscation is notable but not indicative of malicious intent. The malware score is set to 0, the security risk score is low (~0.2), and the obfuscation score is moderate (~0.75). Overall, the code appears safe and intentionally obfuscated for concealment rather than malicious purposes."
