  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit active malicious behavior but contains dynamic and obfuscated features that could be exploited if supplied with malicious package data. Its primary functions are typical for package management tools, but the complexity warrants cautious handling. The overall security risk is moderate, with a malware score of 0.4, obfuscation at 0.7, and risk at 0.5, indicating potential for misuse rather than confirmed malicious activity."
