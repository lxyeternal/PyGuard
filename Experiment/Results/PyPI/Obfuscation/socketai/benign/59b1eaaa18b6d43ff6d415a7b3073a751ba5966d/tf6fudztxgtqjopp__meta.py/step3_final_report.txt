{
  "purpose": "The code defines Protocol classes with method signatures, properties, and overloads, serving as interface or structural definitions without concrete implementations.",
  "sources": "Method signatures, property definitions, and string assignments within method bodies (dummy variables).",
  "sinks": "None present; no data input, output, or external interactions are evident.",
  "flows": "No data flow or data processing occurs; the code only specifies interfaces.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names and string literals assigned within method bodies, with no operational logic or data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of Protocol class definitions with obfuscated variable names and placeholder string assignments. There are no signs of data flow, network activity, or malicious payloads. The obfuscation appears superficial, possibly serving as placeholders or to hinder static analysis. The absence of active logic or external interactions indicates a benign purpose, likely for type hinting or interface definition. The low malware score aligns with the lack of malicious behavior, while the high obfuscated score reflects the suspicious style. Overall, the code is structurally benign but obfuscated.",
  "conclusion": "The code is an obfuscated set of interface definitions with no active malicious activity or security threats. The suspicion is primarily due to obfuscation, but there is no evidence of malware or malicious intent in its current form.",
