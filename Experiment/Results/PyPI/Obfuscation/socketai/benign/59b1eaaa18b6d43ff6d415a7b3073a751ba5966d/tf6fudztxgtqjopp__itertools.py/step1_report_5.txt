  "purpose": "Utility functions and classes for processing iterables with filtering, deduplication, validation, and caching.",
  "sources": "Input iterable parameters in functions and class methods, environment variables are not used, no external data sources accessed.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that handle untrusted data leading to data leaks or system effects. No network, file, or environment variable manipulation observed.",
  "flows": "Input iterables are filtered, deduplicated, and validated through class methods that cache and iterate over data. No external or system interactions detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Code uses standard library functions, employs typical patterns for filtering and caching.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for deduplication and filtering, with options for custom key functions. The class 'WisZskUFVtIQmnTEtRCsnIladQPzTYzL' manages validation, caching, and iteration over data, supporting source-to-sink operations without external system calls. No network access, system modification, or suspicious data handling found. The code appears well-structured, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or malware. It simply provides data processing utilities with validation and caching.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code implements benign data processing utilities with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It uses standard library functions and common patterns without any suspicious or malicious features.",
