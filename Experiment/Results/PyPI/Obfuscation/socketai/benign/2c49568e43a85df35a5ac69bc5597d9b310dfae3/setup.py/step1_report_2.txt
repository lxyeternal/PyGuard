  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'fblm2ssg6d86i0o2', including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Import statements from setuptools and ffmpy3; hardcoded module name and version strings.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data flows or untrusted input handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code primarily defines package setup.",
  "anomalies": "Import of 'vnxmWycpZqvOLjOrIYiIXKKzscmBfWDd' from ffmpy3 without use; unusual import name suggesting obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools for packaging. It imports a module 'vnxmWycpZqvOLjOrIYiIXKKzscmBfWDd' from 'ffmpy3', which appears to be an obfuscated or random string. The module is not used anywhere else in the code, which could suggest obfuscation or malicious intent such as hidden functionality. The setup() call defines standard package metadata with no suspicious content. The import of a seemingly random module name is suspicious, as it may indicate hidden code or malicious behavior, especially since it is not utilized.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script with an unusual import that may suggest obfuscation or malicious intent. No direct malicious actions are evident, but the unused and obfuscated import warrants caution. Overall, the code is benign in function but suspicious in structure.",
