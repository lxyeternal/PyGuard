  "sinks": "None present; no data flow or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No execution or data flow beyond import; import is unused.",
  "anomalies": "Import of a nonsensical, obfuscated symbol from 'ffmpy3' that is not used elsewhere.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with an unusual, obfuscated import of a symbol that is not utilized. The import's name suggests obfuscation or malicious intent, but no malicious actions or data flows are evident. The import's presence alone raises suspicion, but without further code execution or network activity, active malicious behavior cannot be confirmed. The import's obfuscated nature warrants caution, but the lack of other malicious indicators suggests the risk is primarily due to obfuscation rather than active malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains an unused, obfuscated import which is suspicious but does not demonstrate active malicious behavior. The risk is primarily associated with obfuscation and potential hidden payloads. Further investigation into the 'ffmpy3' library and the context of this import is recommended, but based solely on this snippet, the code appears benign.",
