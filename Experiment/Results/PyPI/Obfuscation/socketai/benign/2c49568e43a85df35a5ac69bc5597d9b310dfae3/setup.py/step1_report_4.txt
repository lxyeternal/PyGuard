  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, defining metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Import statements (`setuptools`, `ffmpy3`), hardcoded package name, version, license, classifiers, and keywords.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data sinks such as network calls, file writes, or system commands.",
  "flows": "Import `ffmpy3` and define package metadata; no data flows to or from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Importing `vnxmWycpZqvOLjOrIYiIXKKzscmBfWDd` from `ffmpy3`, which appears to be a nonsensical or obfuscated identifier. The name does not match typical module names, and the imported symbol is unused, suggesting obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard package setup with no apparent malicious functions. However, the import of a seemingly random, unused symbol from `ffmpy3` is suspicious. It could be an attempt to hide malicious code or backdoor. There are no visible sinks or data flows leading to malicious actions, but the obfuscated import raises concerns about possible hidden behavior or code hiding. Overall, the code appears mostly benign but contains suspicious import behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup file with an unusual, potentially obfuscated import that is unused. No direct malicious behavior is evident, but the presence of an obfuscated import warrants further investigation. It may be an attempt to hide malicious code or backdoor, though none is explicitly visible.",
