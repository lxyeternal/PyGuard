  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'fblm2ssg6d86i0o2' that wraps ffmpeg functionalities.",
  "sources": "Import statements for setuptools and ffmpy3, including the module 'vnxmWycpZqvOLjOrIYiIXKKzscmBfWDd' from ffmpy3.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of imported modules and functions, but no specific sinks like network or file I/O are present in this code.",
  "flows": "Importing 'vnxmWycpZqvOLjOrIYiIXKKzscmBfWDd' from ffmpy3; no execution flow or data flow beyond imports is present.",
  "anomalies": "The import of a seemingly random or obfuscated symbol 'vnxmWycpZqvOLjOrIYiIXKKzscmBfWDd' from a known library (ffmpy3) is suspicious; it may be an attempt to hide malicious code or backdoor functionality.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup tools for packaging and attempts to import a potentially obfuscated symbol from the 'ffmpy3' library. The module name 'vnxmWycpZqvOLjOrIYiIXKKzscmBfWDd' does not resemble typical usage or documented functions/classes, which raises suspicion of hidden or malicious intent. No other code, data processing, or external network activity is present. The package metadata appears normal, but the import anomaly is a significant concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior by importing an obscure, seemingly random symbol from a well-known package, indicating potential malicious intent or backdoor. The package may contain hidden malicious functionality that could compromise systems upon installation.",
