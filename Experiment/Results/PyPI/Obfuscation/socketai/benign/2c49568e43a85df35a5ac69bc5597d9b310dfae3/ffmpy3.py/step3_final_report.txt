  "purpose": "A wrapper utility for executing media processing commands (ffmpeg, ffprobe), constructing command-line arguments dynamically from parameters, and managing subprocess execution asynchronously or synchronously.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for command options, arguments, and input data provided to class methods.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess execution with arguments derived from input parameters; potential for untrusted data to influence command line.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> command argument construction -> subprocess invocation -> process communication or execution.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and class names; dynamic command construction from potentially untrusted inputs; lack of explicit input validation; no network activity or data exfiltration detected.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a media processing wrapper, building command-line instructions from input parameters and executing them via subprocess or asyncio. It uses shlex.split to parse string options, which mitigates command injection risks but does not eliminate them if inputs are maliciously crafted. Obfuscation of variable names raises suspicion but is not inherently malicious. Error handling is standard, with custom exceptions for missing executables and subprocess errors. No signs of malware, backdoors, or data leaks are present. The primary security concern is the handling of untrusted inputs in command arguments, which could lead to command injection if not properly validated. The overall structure and behavior are consistent with legitimate media processing utilities, but caution is advised regarding input sanitization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate media processing utility with obfuscated identifiers. No evidence of malware or malicious activity is detected. The main security risk stems from potential command injection if inputs are untrusted; thus, input validation and sanitization are recommended. The obfuscation warrants cautious review but does not indicate malicious intent.",
