      "conclusion": "The code contains an unused, obfuscated import which is suspicious but does not demonstrate active malicious behavior. The risk is primarily associated with obfuscation and potential hidden payloads. Further investigation into the 'ffmpy3' library and the context of this import is recommended, but based solely on this snippet, the code appears benign."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate media processing utility with obfuscated identifiers. No evidence of malware or malicious activity is detected. The main security risk stems from potential command injection if inputs are untrusted; thus, input validation and sanitization are recommended. The obfuscation warrants cautious review but does not indicate malicious intent."
