  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data leaks or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "flows": "The function asserts that a library attribute equals a fixed string; this is a simple check with no data flow beyond comparison.",
  "anomalies": "The function name appears obfuscated and nonsensical; the attribute name is also unusual and obfuscated. No other code or logic is present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a third-party library 'cirq_aqt' and defines a function that performs a single assertion, comparing a library attribute to a specific string. The function name is obfuscated, which could be suspicious, but the operation itself is harmless and a common pattern for version checks. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The obfuscation of names could be an attempt to hide intent, but functionally, this is just a version check.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple, benign version check on a library attribute with obfuscated naming. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks within this code snippet.",
