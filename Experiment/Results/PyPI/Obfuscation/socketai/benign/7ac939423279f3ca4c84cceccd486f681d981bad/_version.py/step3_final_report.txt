  "purpose": "Assign a version string to an obfuscated variable name, likely auto-generated or internal.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; simple variable assignment.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows or external calls.",
  "flows": "N/A; direct assignment without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable name, but benign; no malicious code or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to an obfuscated variable name. No input, output, or external calls are present. The variable name appears obfuscated but is likely auto-generated or internal. The string resembles a development version timestamp, not malicious payload. No suspicious functions, data leaks, or malicious activities are detected. The obfuscation is superficial and does not imply malicious intent. Scores across reports are consistent with benign, auto-generated code. Malware score is correctly zero; security risk is negligible; obfuscation score reflects the obfuscated name but does not indicate maliciousness.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, representing a simple version string assignment with an obfuscated variable name. No signs of malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or security risks are present. The obfuscation appears superficial and non-malicious. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
