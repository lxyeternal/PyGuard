  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data or external outputs present",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is a simple variable assignment",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable name; no apparent malicious behavior or obfuscation, just a random string as a variable name",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a string representing a development version to a variable with an obfuscated name. There are no inputs, external data, or dynamic code execution. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior are present. The variable name appears intentionally obfuscated but does not imply malicious intent. The code does not perform any actions besides this assignment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple variable assignment of a version string with an obfuscated variable name, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
