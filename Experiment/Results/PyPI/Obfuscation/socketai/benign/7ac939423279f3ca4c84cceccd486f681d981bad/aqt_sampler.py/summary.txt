  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, albeit obfuscated, client for remote quantum circuit execution. No evidence of malicious behavior or malware is present. The main concerns are obfuscation and secure handling of tokens and network responses. The static analysis supports a low malware likelihood, with moderate obfuscation and security risk due to network and token handling."
