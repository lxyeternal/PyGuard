  "conclusion": "The code appears benign in isolation, with obfuscation being the primary concern. No malicious activity is evident, but the obfuscation warrants further review if these imports are used elsewhere in the project. The scores are consistent with the analysis, with malware score at 0, obfuscation at 0.8, and risk at 0.2."
