{
  "purpose": "Calculate and display FLOPs, MACs, and Params for a specific model or component.",
  "sources": "The function `enQYAlbENKeTpqZcUmmCKXmRGWkBSbtV` imported from an external module `calflops`, and string variables containing model information.",
  "sinks": "The `print` statement outputs data to the console; no untrusted data is being sent elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the imported function, through variable assignments, to the print statement; no external data sources or network connections are involved.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names; the code appears intentionally obfuscated or automatically generated, which could be suspicious, but no malicious behavior is evident from the given code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function with a non-descriptive name from a module `calflops`, then calls this function with specific parameters related to a model. It assigns constants to variables, calls the function, and prints the results. There are no hardcoded secrets, input handling, or external communications. The obfuscated naming might be a sign of attempts to hide intent but does not necessarily indicate malicious activity. Overall, the code's purpose seems benign: performing a computational estimate and outputting results. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward utility for computing and displaying model metrics, with obfuscated names but no evidence of malicious intent or behavior. It is likely part of a larger, benign workflow.",
