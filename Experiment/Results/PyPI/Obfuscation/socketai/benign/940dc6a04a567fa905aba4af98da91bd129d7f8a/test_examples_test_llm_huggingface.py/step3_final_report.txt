  "purpose": "Retrieve and display model performance metrics (FLOPs, MACs, Params) using an obfuscated external function.",
  "sources": "The imported function 'enQYAlbENKeTpqZcUmmCKXmRGWkBSbtV' from 'calflops', the model repository string, and constants used as arguments.",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs metrics; no untrusted data sinks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Input data (model name and constants) flows into the external function, which returns metrics that are then printed.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function and variable names, external dependency 'calflops', and nonsensical variable names suggest obfuscation; no malicious code detected directly.",
  "analysis": "The code imports an obfuscated function from an external module, calls it with a model identifier and constants, and prints the resulting metrics. The obfuscation raises suspicion but no malicious activity such as network communication, data exfiltration, or system modification is evident. The purpose appears to be benign model performance reporting. Given the obfuscation and external dependency, there is a moderate level of concern, but no concrete evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily benign, performing a straightforward task of retrieving and displaying model metrics. Obfuscation and external dependencies warrant caution but do not confirm malicious behavior. Further inspection of the external module and function is recommended to rule out hidden malicious payloads.",
