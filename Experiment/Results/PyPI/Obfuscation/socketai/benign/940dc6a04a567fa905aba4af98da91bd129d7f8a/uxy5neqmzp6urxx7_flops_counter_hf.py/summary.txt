  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated NLP inference pipeline with no direct evidence of malicious activity. The high obfuscation level warrants caution, but the absence of explicit malicious actions suggests a moderate security concern. Further analysis of the utility modules and runtime behavior is recommended to confirm safety."
