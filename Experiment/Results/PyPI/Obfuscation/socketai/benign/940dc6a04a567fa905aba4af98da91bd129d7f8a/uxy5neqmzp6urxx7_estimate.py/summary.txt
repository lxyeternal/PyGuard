  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated but appears to be a legitimate utility for model management and display. There is no evidence of malicious activity such as network calls, data theft, or sabotage. The primary concern is obfuscation, which warrants caution but does not confirm malicious intent. Overall, the code is low risk but should be reviewed further if used in sensitive environments."
