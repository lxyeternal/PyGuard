  "purpose": "Utility functions for verifying, loading, and managing models from Hugging Face Hub, and creating formatted tables.",
  "sources": "Model repository identifiers, tokens, error objects, and input data for table formatting.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks if model info or tokens are mishandled; no direct sinks of untrusted data are evident.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (model repo, tokens) are processed through verification functions, leading to model loading or error handling; table creation functions process data for display.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with nonsensical variable and function names, suspicious import from a module with a random string, complex logic that could conceal malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code performs model verification and loading with dynamic imports and error handling, wrapped in heavily obfuscated code. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious system modifications are directly observed. The obfuscation and complex structure are suspicious but do not constitute evidence of malicious intent. The functions serve legitimate purposes in model management and display, typical in ML workflows. The obfuscation could be an attempt to hide malicious code, but no concrete malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated but appears to be a legitimate utility for model management and display. There is no evidence of malicious activity such as network calls, data theft, or sabotage. The primary concern is obfuscation, which warrants caution but does not confirm malicious intent. Overall, the code is low risk but should be reviewed further if used in sensitive environments.",
