  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated but functions as a model inference wrapper with no concrete evidence of malicious activity. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. Static analysis indicates low malware risk, primarily due to obfuscation and complexity. Continuous runtime or dynamic analysis is recommended if source trustworthiness is uncertain."
