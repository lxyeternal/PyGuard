      "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated but appears to be a legitimate utility for model management and display. There is no evidence of malicious activity such as network calls, data theft, or sabotage. The primary concern is obfuscation, which warrants caution but does not confirm malicious intent. Overall, the code is low risk but should be reviewed further if used in sensitive environments."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign in its current form, consisting only of obfuscated import statements with no evidence of malicious activity. The high obfuscation warrants cautious review of the imported modules, but overall, the security risk remains low. Malware score should be 0, obfuscation score high (~0.8), and overall risk low (~0.2). Further dynamic or runtime analysis could be performed if additional code is available."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation and employs techniques commonly associated with malicious manipulation of tensor operations. It is highly suspicious and could be used for covert sabotage or data exfiltration in a supply chain context. The high malware score (0.8) and risk score (0.9) are justified due to the potential for malicious behavior through stealthy interception of core framework functions."

The high obfuscation warrants caution, but overall, the security risk is low. Further review in context is recommended to ensure no hidden payloads."

The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. Static analysis indicates low malware risk, primarily due to obfuscation and complexity. Continuous runtime or dynamic analysis is recommended if source trustworthiness is uncertain."

      "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated NLP inference pipeline with no direct evidence of malicious activity. The high obfuscation level warrants caution, but the absence of explicit malicious actions suggests a moderate security concern. Further analysis of the utility modules and runtime behavior is recommended to confirm safety."

      "conclusion": "While the code appears to perform legitimate model analysis, its use of runtime package installation and obfuscated code are red flags. The current low malware score underestimates the potential risk. It is advisable to increase the malware score to around 0.7, obfuscated score to 0.8, and security risk to 0.8 until further validation of the 'calflops' package and the imported function is performed."

Further inspection of the external module and function is recommended to rule out hidden malicious payloads."

The risk and malware scores are appropriate; the main concern is obfuscation, which should be monitored."
