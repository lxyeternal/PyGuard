{
  "purpose": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules with obfuscated or nonsensical names, likely for code organization or proprietary reasons.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules with obfuscated names.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, network activity, or external data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; only static imports are present.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated module and function names, which may indicate suspicious concealment but are not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is limited to import statements with obfuscated identifiers, showing no executable logic, data processing, or network activity. The high obfuscation scores across reports are justified, but no evidence of malicious behavior is present. Malware scores are consistently zero, aligning with the absence of malicious payloads or actions. Security risk scores are low, reflecting the static nature of the code. The confidence levels are moderate, acknowledging suspicion due to obfuscation but recognizing the lack of concrete malicious activity. The reports correctly avoid overestimating threat based solely on naming obfuscation and recommend further review of imported modules if needed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign in its current form, consisting only of obfuscated import statements with no evidence of malicious activity. The high obfuscation warrants cautious review of the imported modules, but overall, the security risk remains low. Malware score should be 0, obfuscation score high (~0.8), and overall risk low (~0.2). Further dynamic or runtime analysis could be performed if additional code is available.",
