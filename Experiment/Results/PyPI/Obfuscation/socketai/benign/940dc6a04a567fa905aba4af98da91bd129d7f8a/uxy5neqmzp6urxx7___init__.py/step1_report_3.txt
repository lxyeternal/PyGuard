  "purpose": "Import various modules and functions, likely for computational or utility tasks within a larger project.",
  "sources": "Import statements retrieving modules and functions from local package files (.flops_counter, .flops_counter_hf, .utils, .estimate).",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks or output functions are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Not explicitly defined, as this code only performs imports without executing further logic.",
  "anomalies": "The imported function and module names are obfuscated, using seemingly random strings instead of descriptive identifiers, which may be suspicious or an attempt to hide functionality.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with no executable logic, data handling, or user input. The obfuscated naming pattern is unusual and could be a method to conceal malicious activity or proprietary code. There are no apparent signs of malicious behavior such as network connections, data exfiltration, or malicious system modifications within this snippet. However, the use of obfuscated names warrants caution and suggests further review of the imported modules for potential malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code only imports modules with obfuscated names, raising suspicion but no concrete evidence of malicious behavior is present in this snippet alone. The overall security risk is low, but the obfuscation warrants further inspection of the imported modules.",
