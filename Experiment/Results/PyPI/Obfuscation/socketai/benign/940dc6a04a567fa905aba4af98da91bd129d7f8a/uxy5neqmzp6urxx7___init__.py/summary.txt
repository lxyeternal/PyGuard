  "conclusion": "The code is benign in its current form, consisting only of obfuscated import statements with no evidence of malicious activity. The high obfuscation warrants cautious review of the imported modules, but overall, the security risk remains low. Malware score should be 0, obfuscation score high (~0.8), and overall risk low (~0.2). Further dynamic or runtime analysis could be performed if additional code is available."
