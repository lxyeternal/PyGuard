{
  "purpose": "The code installs a package 'calflops' at runtime, imports an obfuscated function, and performs model FLOPs, MACs, and Params calculations on AlexNet, then prints the results.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the environment via os.system (package installation), and imports a function from 'calflops'.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs results via print statements; no external data transmission or file writes are evident.",
  "flows": "Source: os.system call and import; Sink: print output; Flow: package installation and import lead to function execution and output.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious use of os.system for package installation at runtime, obfuscated function name, repeated calls with different parameters, no validation or checks.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically installs a package and uses an obfuscated function, which are red flags. It performs model analysis tasks benign in purpose but employs practices common in malicious scripts to conceal intent. No malicious payloads are directly evident, but the risky practices and obfuscation justify elevated suspicion. The malware score should reflect potential for malicious behavior due to runtime install and obfuscation, even if no direct malicious activity is confirmed.",
  "conclusion": "While the code appears to perform legitimate model analysis, its use of runtime package installation and obfuscated code are red flags. The current low malware score underestimates the potential risk. It is advisable to increase the malware score to around 0.7, obfuscated score to 0.8, and security risk to 0.8 until further validation of the 'calflops' package and the imported function is performed.",
