  "conclusion": "While the code appears to perform legitimate model analysis, its use of runtime package installation and obfuscated code are red flags. The current low malware score underestimates the potential risk. It is advisable to increase the malware score to around 0.7, obfuscated score to 0.8, and security risk to 0.8 until further validation of the 'calflops' package and the imported function is performed."
