{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for token processing, size formatting, package verification, and performance metrics, primarily serving as helper functions within larger systems.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters, module attributes, and internal variables; uses importlib for package checks.",
  "sinks": "No external network, file I/O, or data exfiltration observed; data flows are internal and benign.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through processing functions to output tensors or formatted strings; no external or malicious data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation evidenced by variable names, incomplete functions, references to undefined variables (e.g., 'gjUdlrzPlzOTxELWVbukFvGgQnwTUhDy'), and calls to undefined functions like 'number_to_string'. The function 'GclQVWVtUplAdxcEQctInQmEdlhULjsS' contains inconsistent variable usage ('size' vs. 'dQkGoWDzvirUwsHqqthXWGlTSIpJQaze'), indicating incomplete or intentionally obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions with heavily obfuscated variable names and incomplete implementations, including references to undefined variables and functions. No evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or system sabotage is present. The obfuscation appears to be deliberate, possibly to conceal intent or complicate analysis, but the core functions are benign. The incomplete and inconsistent code suggests poor maintenance or intentional concealment rather than active malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions with significant obfuscation and incomplete implementation. There is no direct evidence of malware or malicious activity. The high obfuscation warrants caution, but overall, the security risk is low. Further review in context is recommended to ensure no hidden payloads.",
