  "conclusion": "The script is a directory traversal utility with significant obfuscation. No malicious activity or payloads are detected. The obfuscation raises suspicion but appears to serve concealment rather than malicious purpose. The overall security risk is low, but the obfuscation warrants caution if used in supply chain contexts."
