  "purpose": "Define module exports by importing specific classes or functions from local modules for use in other parts of the application.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .OpenAIWrapper, .memory.KnowledgeGraphDB, .KnowledgeGraphMemory, .FactRetriever.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, any imported modules could contain malicious code or backdoors; however, the import statements themselves do not execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "The import statements load classes/functions into the namespace, and the __all__ list exposes these for external use.",
  "anomalies": "All imported names appear as obfuscated strings, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets or credentials, and no suspicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code only performs imports from local modules with obfuscated class/function names, and sets the __all__ list. There is no dynamic execution, network activity, or data handling. The use of obfuscated names could be an attempt to hide intent but is not malicious by itself. The code structure is minimal and typical for defining module exports.",
  "conclusion": "The code's primary function is to re-export specific classes/functions for external modules. No malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious behavior is detected. The obfuscated class names warrant caution but do not constitute malware or security risk on their own.",
