  "purpose": "The code is designed to import specific classes or functions from local modules and define an export list for a package.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing from local modules within the package",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or malicious activity present",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; simply imports and exports modules",
  "anomalies": "Imports from modules with obfuscated or non-descriptive names (e.g., bwFxGkTdOyKAbIykrZLEXuHwOWkDVJYD, eqgSGiyJYKcKMLpFCgVJDlVqSyGHrgwl), which could indicate obfuscation or malicious intent. The presence of duplicated import OXrMxIoJJgvNMJXLvSLdlReBNCDoqyEp may suggest code manipulation or redundancy, but not necessarily malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from internal modules with seemingly obfuscated or nonsensical names. The __all__ list exposes these imports for external use. The naming pattern does not match standard or descriptive naming conventions, which could be a red flag for obfuscation or malicious intent, but it might also be a coding style to hide functionality. There are no evident data flows from untrusted sources or dangerous sink operations such as network communication, file access, or code execution. The code does not perform any actions besides importing and defining exports.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward module import and export definition, but the obfuscated import names raise suspicion of possible concealment. There is no direct evidence of malicious behavior in this fragment alone, but the obfuscated naming warrants caution. No malicious activity or security risk is explicitly identifiable from this code snippet.",
