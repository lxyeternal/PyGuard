  "conclusion": "The code is a benign NLP processing script with obfuscated identifiers. Despite obfuscation and minor syntax anomalies, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or supply chain threats. The obfuscation appears to be an attempt to conceal purpose but does not translate into security risks."
