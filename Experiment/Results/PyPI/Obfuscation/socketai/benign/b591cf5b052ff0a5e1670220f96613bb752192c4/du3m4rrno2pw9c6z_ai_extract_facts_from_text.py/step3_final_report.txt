  "purpose": "Extracts specific pattern matches involving proper nouns and verbs, then processes matches into tuples with string modifications; loads an NLP model without further use.",
  "sources": "Regex pattern matching on input text; loading spaCy NLP model",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or system/network interactions present",
  "flows": "Input text -> regex findall -> tuple processing -> output list; spaCy model load (unused)",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; unused spaCy model load; incomplete or suspicious code structure",
  "analysis": "The code performs pattern matching with regex to extract sequences of capitalized words followed by specific verbs, then processes these matches into tuples, replacing spaces with underscores in one element. Variable names are nonsensical, indicating obfuscation. The second function loads a spaCy NLP model but does not utilize it, which is suspicious but not malicious. No network, file, or system modifications are evident. The code appears incomplete or intentionally obfuscated, with no signs of malicious activity, data exfiltration, or sabotage. The high obfuscation scores are justified by variable naming and code structure, but malware scores remain at zero due to lack of malicious behavior. Security risk scores are low, reflecting benign pattern extraction and model loading without misuse.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign but heavily obfuscated, with no evidence of malicious intent or activity. The high obfuscation scores are justified, and malware scores should remain at zero. The overall security risk is minimal, primarily due to the obfuscation and incomplete nature of the code.",
