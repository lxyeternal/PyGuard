{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a Python module intended for general utility purposes, such as performing calculations or data processing.",
  "sources": "Potential data sources include environment variables, user input functions, and imported modules that may read external data or configurations.",
  "sinks": "Possible sinks are output functions like print(), logging, file writes, or network communication functions that could transmit data externally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources like environment variables or input functions through processing logic to sinks such as network transmission or file output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code structure is straightforward with no obfuscated segments or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily composed of standard Python functions and imports. No malicious behaviors such as network connections to suspicious domains, data exfiltration, or backdoor functionalities are evident. There are no signs of obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or use of dangerous modules. The logic seems typical for utility scripts, with no evident security issues or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign utility script with standard operations. The confidence level is high, and no indicators of obfuscation or malware are present.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
