  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or functionality related to the package's intended use, which is not explicitly specified due to lack of visible context.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not clearly visible in the provided code snippet; no explicit input functions or data reads are identified.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are not explicitly shown; no direct data leakage points or sensitive operations are evident in the visible code.",
  "flows": "No clear source-to-sink data flows are identifiable based on the provided code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hard-coded secrets, or suspicious constructs are apparent. The code appears straightforward without obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity such as network communications, system modifications, or hidden payloads. Usage of third-party libraries seems standard, and there are no evident attempts at obfuscation or malicious logic. Lack of input/output operations or suspicious constructs suggests benign behavior. Without additional context or hidden payloads, the code appears safe.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided snippet, the code shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It seems benign and free of anomalies. However, the analysis is limited by the small code excerpt; more context could reveal additional details.",
