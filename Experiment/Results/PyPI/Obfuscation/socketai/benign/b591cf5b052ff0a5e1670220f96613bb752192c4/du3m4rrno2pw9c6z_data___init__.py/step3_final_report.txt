  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, network sockets, file operations, environment variables, code snippets, utility functions.",
  "sinks": "Network communication (sockets, network I/O), file writing, environment variables, user inputs.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables and user inputs flow into network or file sinks; data potentially flows from inputs to outputs via network or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected; code minimal or absent in some reports; no malicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code described is standard, with typical data sources and sinks. No evidence of obfuscation or malicious intent is present. Socket and network operations are common but could be misused; however, no malicious activity such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or harmful modifications is indicated. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2-0.3) are consistent with the benign assessment, considering potential misuse. Confidence levels are moderate to high based on limited context. Overall, the code appears benign with low security risks, primarily related to network operations that should be monitored but are not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets and descriptions across all reports indicate benign, standard utility or minimal code with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the evidence. No further action or adjustment is necessary.",
