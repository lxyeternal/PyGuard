  "purpose": "Minimal import of an obfuscated symbol from a local module, with an explicit export list.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .tree module, referencing symbol 'DZbKikeJWQvWbNydnbhRaULmBjtrOySI'.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data flow, network activity, or data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Import of obfuscated symbol potentially from a malicious or benign module; no further data flow within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a highly obfuscated, nonsensical symbol name; mismatch between __all__ listing 'generate_tree' and absence of such definition in snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, performing a local import of an obfuscated symbol and defining an export list. The obfuscated name raises suspicion but does not, by itself, indicate malicious activity. The absence of network, data, or execution behavior suggests low immediate risk. The inconsistency between the __all__ list and the imported symbol indicates incomplete code or potential concealment. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware likelihood remains low without further context.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet is benign in isolation but contains obfuscated naming that warrants further review in the context of the full package. No direct malicious activity is evident, but the obfuscation pattern is a red flag for further investigation.",
