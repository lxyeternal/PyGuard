  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on suspicious patterns, obfuscation, and potential malicious functions.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, file I/O, network communication, dynamic execution functions (eval/exec), hardcoded URLs/credentials, suspicious strings, system info collection.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, file writes, environment variable access, eval/exec calls, potential data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or network inputs flow into eval/exec or data processing functions, potentially leading to malicious actions or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, suspicious URLs/IPs, use of eval/exec, unusual string patterns, inconsistent code structure.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits patterns typical of malicious or suspicious scripts, including obfuscation, dynamic execution, and hardcoded data. These patterns suggest potential malicious intent, especially if eval/exec are used with untrusted input. The absence of concrete malicious payloads or data exfiltration points reduces certainty but warrants caution. The suspicion is supported by high obfuscation scores and dynamic execution indicators. The overall security risk is elevated when such patterns are present, particularly with hardcoded URLs/IPs and eval/exec usage. The confidence in malicious intent is high if these indicators are confirmed; otherwise, suspicion remains moderate.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are common in malicious scripts, but without concrete payloads or network activity, certainty is limited. The risk is elevated due to suspicious patterns, warranting cautious handling. The overall malware score is set at 0.65, reflecting high suspicion; obfuscation at 0.6; and security risk at 0.7, indicating significant concern.",
