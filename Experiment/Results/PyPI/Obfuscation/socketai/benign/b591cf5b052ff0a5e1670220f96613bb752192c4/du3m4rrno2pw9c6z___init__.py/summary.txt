  "conclusion": "The code shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are common in malicious scripts, but without concrete payloads or network activity, certainty is limited. The risk is elevated due to suspicious patterns, warranting cautious handling. The overall malware score is set at 0.65, reflecting high suspicion; obfuscation at 0.6; and security risk at 0.7, indicating significant concern."
