{
  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script with obfuscated variable names and a suspicious assignment, likely intended for packaging the project.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file; the 'setup()' function call with package metadata; the assignment to 'OhkNBcszgBDgmnVvyqsXyvYrlQZmVHNC='.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data flows; no network calls, code execution, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Reading README content into a variable, then passing package info to 'setup()'; the obfuscated assignment appears isolated and does not influence execution.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; the assignment 'OhkNBcszgBDgmnVvyqsXyvYrlQZmVHNC=' used as a parameter in 'setup()', which is invalid syntax; potential typo or obfuscation attempt.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with high obfuscation and a syntax anomaly. The invalid parameter name suggests either obfuscation or a mistake, but no malicious code, network activity, or data leakage is present. The obfuscation may be superficial, designed to conceal intent, but does not indicate malicious behavior. The syntax error indicates the code would not run as-is, pointing to either an obfuscation tactic or a typo. Overall, the code appears benign, with the main concern being obfuscation rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with superficial obfuscation and a syntax anomaly that likely results from obfuscation or error. No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious activity is detected. The high obfuscation score reflects the nonsensical variable names and unusual parameter usage, but the overall security risk remains low. Caution is advised if deploying in sensitive environments, but based on this snippet, the code appears benign.",
