  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate OCR and image detection component with significant obfuscation that warrants caution but does not demonstrate malicious intent. Scores are consistent with the analysis, indicating low malware risk and moderate obfuscation concern. Continuous monitoring and further review are recommended, especially if integrated into larger systems or if obfuscation increases."
