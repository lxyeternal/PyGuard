  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate automation utility with obfuscation that could be used to conceal malicious intent. No concrete evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads is present. The main risk lies in potential misuse if inputs are untrusted, but the code itself is benign."
