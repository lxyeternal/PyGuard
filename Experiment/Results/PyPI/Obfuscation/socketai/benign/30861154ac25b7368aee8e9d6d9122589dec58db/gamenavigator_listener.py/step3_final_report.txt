  "purpose": "Abstract base class for keyboard and mouse input listeners using pynput, designed to be subclassed with specific event handling logic.",
  "sources": "Initialization of keyboard and mouse listeners with callback methods; abstract methods meant to be implemented by subclasses.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks or network activity present in this fragment.",
  "flows": "Listener callbacks invoke abstract methods; actual event handling depends on subclass implementations.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of class and method names; no concrete event handling logic provided; potential for misuse due to obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract framework for input device monitoring with heavily obfuscated identifiers, which raises suspicion but does not demonstrate malicious activity in this fragment. The absence of network, data exfiltration, or system modification suggests low immediate threat. Obfuscation warrants caution, but without evidence of malicious callbacks or payloads, the code appears to be a benign input capture framework. The overall structure and lack of suspicious operations support a low malware score, with high obfuscation justifying a high obfuscated score. The risk remains low but should be monitored if integrated into larger systems.",
  "conclusion": "This is a heavily obfuscated input event listener base class with no evident malicious activity. Obfuscation raises suspicion, but in isolation, the code appears benign. Further investigation into subclasses and their implementations is recommended to confirm intent.",
