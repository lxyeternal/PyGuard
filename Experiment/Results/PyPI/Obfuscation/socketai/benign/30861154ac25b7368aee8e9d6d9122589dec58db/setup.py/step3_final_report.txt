  "purpose": "Standard setup script for a Python package, reading README.md and requirements.txt files, with obfuscated variable names.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' and 'requirements.txt' files, variables assigned with file contents.",
  "sinks": "Passing file contents to setuptools.setup() parameters; no untrusted data sinks detected.",
  "flows": "File reads -> variable assignment -> setuptools.setup() call with variables.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; 'requirements.txt' read with 'utf-16' encoding; no validation or sanitization.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a typical package setup: reading files and invoking setuptools.setup(). Variable names are obfuscated, which reduces readability but is not malicious. The use of 'utf-16' for 'requirements.txt' is unconventional and could cause issues if the file isn't encoded accordingly, but it does not indicate malicious intent. No network activity, dynamic code execution, or suspicious logic is present. The obfuscation appears superficial, aimed at concealment rather than malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated around 0.6-0.7, risk around 0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's benign nature. Given the absence of malicious indicators, the overall security posture is very low risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated setup script with no malicious intent. The obfuscation and unusual encoding are superficial and do not impact security. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
