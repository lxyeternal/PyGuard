  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes and raise one of them with a message",
  "sources": "The string literal '123' used as an exception message in the raise statement",
  "sinks": "The raise statement that throws an exception with a message",
  "flows": "The string '123' flows from the source in the raise statement as the exception message",
  "anomalies": "Use of custom exception classes that do not perform any unusual or suspicious behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes, inheriting from a base exception class, with minimal implementation. The main block raises a specific custom exception with a static string message. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code is straightforward, primarily defining exceptions and raising one with a hardcoded message, which is standard practice in exception handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a simple, benign demonstration of custom exception class definitions and raising an exception with a static message. No malicious activity or security risks are evident.",
