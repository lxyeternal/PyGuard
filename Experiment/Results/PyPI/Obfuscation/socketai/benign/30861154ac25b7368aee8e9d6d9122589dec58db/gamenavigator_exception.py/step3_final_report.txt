  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes and raise one with a static message '123'.",
  "sources": "The instantiation of the class faHGpvyOhdnTHxINOslLZgZYoQoYjZUX with message '123' in the main block.",
  "sinks": "The raise statement that raises the exception instance with the message '123'.",
  "flows": "The instantiation of faHGpvyOhdnTHxINOslLZgZYoQoYjZUX with '123' flows directly into the raise statement, which then terminates the program with an exception.",
  "anomalies": "Class names are obfuscated and nonsensical, but this appears intentional or placeholder; no malicious code or external data sources are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a base exception class and three subclasses with obfuscated names. In the main block, it raises an instance of one subclass with a static message '123'. There are no external inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The class names are obfuscated, which could be suspicious, but given the simplicity and static nature of the code, it appears benign. The raise statement is straightforward, and no malicious payloads or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is minimal and serves as a simple demonstration of custom exceptions. The obfuscation of class names does not imply malicious intent in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal example of custom exception class definitions and raising an exception with a static message. No malicious or security-threatening behavior is detected. The obfuscated class names are superficial and do not indicate malicious activity. The current scores are appropriate, with malware score at 0, obfuscation score at 0.8 due to class name obfuscation, and a very low security risk score around 0.1. No adjustments are necessary.",
