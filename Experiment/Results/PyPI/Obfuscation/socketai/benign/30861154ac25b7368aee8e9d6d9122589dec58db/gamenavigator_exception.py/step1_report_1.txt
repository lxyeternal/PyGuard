{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes and raise one of them with a message.",
  "sources": "Input data is not explicitly read; the only data source is the string argument provided during exception instantiation.",
  "sinks": "The exception is raised with a string message, but this is standard and does not constitute a sink for malicious data.",
  "flows": "The string '123' flows from the instantiation of the exception class to the raise statement, then propagates as an unhandled exception if not caught.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present. Exception classes are straightforward, with no suspicious attributes or behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes, inheriting from a base exception class. One of these classes is instantiated with the message '123' and then raised immediately upon script execution. There are no external inputs, no network activity, no code injection, and no suspicious behavior detected. The code appears to be a simple demonstration of custom exceptions with no malicious intent or security risk.",
  "conclusion": "This code only creates custom exception classes and raises one with a fixed message. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. It is benign and appears to serve as a minimal example or placeholder.",
