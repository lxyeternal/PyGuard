  "purpose": "Custom exception classes definition and raising a specific exception with a message",
  "sources": "The string '123' passed as an argument to the exception instance",
  "sinks": "Raising an exception with a message; no untrusted data flows beyond the initial input",
  "flows": "The string '123' flows from the instantiation to the raise statement, propagating as the exception message",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes, with one subclassed from another, all following typical Python class patterns. At the main entry point, it raises an instance of a custom exception with a hardcoded message '123'. The code does not process external input, perform network activity, or execute suspicious operations. The exception message is hardcoded and benign. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious logic are present. The overall structure appears standard for custom exception definitions and usage.",
  "conclusion": "The code simply defines custom exceptions and raises one with a static message. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
