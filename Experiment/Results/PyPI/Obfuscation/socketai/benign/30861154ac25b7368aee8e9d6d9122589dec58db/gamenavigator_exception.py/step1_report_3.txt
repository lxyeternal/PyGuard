{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes and raise one of them with a message",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only defines classes and raises an exception with a static message",
  "sinks": "The only sink is the raise statement that throws an exception with a static message",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows through the code; the exception is raised with a hardcoded message '123'",
  "anomalies": "The exception class names appear obfuscated or randomly generated; the code structure is minimal and intentionally simple; no obfuscated or malicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code defines a base exception class and three subclasses, all inheriting from the base exception. The subclasses do not add additional behavior. At runtime, the script immediately raises one of the custom exceptions with a static string '123'. No external data, user input, or network activity is involved. The static message and class names do not indicate malicious intent. There are no suspicious code patterns, data leaks, or malicious behaviors observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward demonstration of custom exception class definitions and raising an exception with a static message. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code appears benign and intentionally simple.",
