  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal example of custom exception class definitions and raising an exception with a static message. No malicious or security-threatening behavior is detected. The obfuscated class names are superficial and do not indicate malicious activity. The current scores are appropriate, with malware score at 0, obfuscation score at 0.8 due to class name obfuscation, and a very low security risk score around 0.1. No adjustments are necessary."
