      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal example of custom exception class definitions and raising an exception with a static message. No malicious or security-threatening behavior is detected. The obfuscated class names are superficial and do not indicate malicious activity. The current scores are appropriate, with malware score at 0, obfuscation score at 0.8 due to class name obfuscation, and a very low security risk score around 0.1. No adjustments are necessary."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate OCR and image detection component with significant obfuscation that warrants caution but does not demonstrate malicious intent. Scores are consistent with the analysis, indicating low malware risk and moderate obfuscation concern. Continuous monitoring and further review are recommended, especially if integrated into larger systems or if obfuscation increases."

      "obfuscated": 0.8,
      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code is primarily a legitimate image template matching utility with significant obfuscation and unsafe dynamic code execution via eval(). While no direct malware or malicious activity is evident, the obfuscation and eval() usage could be exploited if inputs are malicious. The overall security risk is moderate, primarily due to the potential for code injection or concealment of malicious routines."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate automation utility with obfuscation that could be used to conceal malicious intent. No concrete evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads is present. The main risk lies in potential misuse if inputs are untrusted, but the code itself is benign."

      "conclusion": "The code functions as a game interaction handler with significant obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain sabotage. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not justify classifying the code as malicious. Overall, it appears to be a legitimate component of a game framework, with obfuscation possibly used for IP protection or complexity concealment."

      "conclusion": "The code contains an invalid, non-standard parameter in 'logging.basicConfig()', which is suspicious and likely obfuscation or a typo. There is no evidence of malicious activity or payloads. The variable is unused and the overall behavior is benign. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable, with a slight emphasis on obfuscation suspicion. Overall, the code is not malicious but warrants caution due to obfuscation indicators."
