  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected. The code is straightforward configuration data.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of variable assignments with string and list values, typical for configuration files. No user input, network communication, or sensitive operations are present. The data appears to be static configuration details, including project information and directory paths. No obfuscated code, malicious code, or malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration or system manipulation are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration snippet for a documentation build process, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
