  "sources": "Variable assignments containing static strings, lists, and dictionaries; no external input or dynamic data.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, network operations, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static data assignments with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, but no malicious or suspicious code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static configuration script for Sphinx documentation with obfuscated variable names. No dynamic code, network activity, or data processing is present. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious patterns are detected. The obfuscation appears superficial and does not imply malicious intent. The code's static nature and lack of external interactions confirm its benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration for Sphinx documentation. No malware, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are present. The obfuscated variable names do not indicate malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
