{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define configuration variables for a documentation project, likely using Sphinx.",
  "sources": "Variable assignments at the beginning of the code, containing strings and lists used for configuration settings.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or perform security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; data appears static and hardcoded.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code. No dynamic execution or obfuscation present. All variables are assigned static, benign strings or lists.",
  "analysis": "The code solely assigns static configuration values, such as extensions, template paths, build directories, URLs, themes, and static resource directories. There are no functions, no data input handling, no command execution, and no network operations or data leaks. It resembles a typical configuration script for a documentation build process. No anomalies, malicious patterns, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign configuration setup for a Sphinx documentation project. It contains no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is purely declarative with static data, and no evidence of sabotage or malicious intent.",
