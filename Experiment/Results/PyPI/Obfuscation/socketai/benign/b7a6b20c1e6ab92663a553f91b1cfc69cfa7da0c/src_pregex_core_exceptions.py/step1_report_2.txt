{
  "purpose": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes used for error handling and validation in a larger application or library, possibly related to regex or pattern matching.",
  "sources": "Class definitions, particularly the __init__ methods and string construction for error messages.",
  "sinks": "Super().__init__ calls with constructed error messages; no other external sinks or data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of exception classes leads to super().__init__ calls, but no external data flows or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "All classes are simple custom exceptions with obfuscated class names; no user input handling, data parsing, or external communication observed. The class names and error messages are non-descriptive, possibly intentionally obfuscated, but this alone is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code only defines custom exception classes with obfuscated and non-descriptive names. Error messages are static or derived from parameters but do not contain any suspicious content or external data handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or system modification. The obfuscation appears to serve to hinder understanding but does not inherently imply malicious intent. The lack of any code execution, input handling, or data transmission indicates no malicious activity or malware presence.",
  "conclusion": "This code consists solely of obfuscated exception class definitions intended for error handling within a larger, possibly regex-related library. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within this snippet.",
