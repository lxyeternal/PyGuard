{
  "purpose": "This code defines multiple custom exception classes for handling specific error scenarios, likely related to pattern matching or class operations.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from parameters passed to exception constructors, such as strings, integers, or objects (e.g., pattern objects).",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data directly leads to data leaks or harmful effects. No network, file, or system modification code is present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters in exception constructors to exception messages, but no dangerous or untrusted data is processed in a way that causes harm.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses obfuscated class and variable names throughout, which could be an attempt to hide intent. Exception messages reference pattern operations and class manipulations, but do not perform actual pattern matching or manipulation here. There is no executable malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions with constructor methods that format error messages. The parameter names and message contents suggest they relate to pattern validation, class operations, and range validation. The use of obfuscated names and indirect message construction might be for obfuscation, but no actual pattern processing or network activity is present. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious data flows are identified. The code is structurally consistent with normal exception class definitions, with no suspicious or malicious code execution.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a set of exception classes for handling specific error cases in pattern or class operations. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain attacks within this module. The obfuscation seems to be a form of code concealment rather than malicious intent.",
