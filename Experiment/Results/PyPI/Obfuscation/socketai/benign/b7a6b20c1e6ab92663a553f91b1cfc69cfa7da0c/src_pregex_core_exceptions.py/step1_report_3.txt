{
  "purpose": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes, likely for use in a larger parsing or validation framework.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads input or data; it solely defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data is processed or transmitted within this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs as the code only defines exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "All exception classes have obfuscated, non-descriptive class and variable names, which may hinder understanding. The messages are somewhat related to regex and class operations, but they do not perform any runtime actions. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code only consists of class definitions for custom exceptions, with obfuscated class names and constructor messages. No data input, network activity, or code execution logic is present. The naming pattern suggests intentional obfuscation, but there is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system manipulation, or network communication. The messages imply use in regex or class operation contexts, but they serve only to provide exception messages.\nOverall, the code appears to be part of a larger, possibly complex parser or validator system, with obfuscation perhaps for licensing or obscurity reasons. No malicious activity or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely definitional with obfuscated class names and no active malicious behavior. It does not contain malware or security risks, merely custom exceptions likely used in other parts of a program.",
