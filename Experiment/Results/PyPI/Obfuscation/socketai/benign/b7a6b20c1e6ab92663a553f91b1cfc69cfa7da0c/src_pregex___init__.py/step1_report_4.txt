  "purpose": "The code imports modules from the 'pregex' package, likely to utilize regex-related functionalities, but does not perform any explicit actions.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations are present in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No data output, network calls, or sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks due to the absence of executable code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only importing modules without further logic. No hardcoded secrets, unusual patterns, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from the 'pregex' library's core and meta modules. There is no execution, data processing, or interaction with external systems. Since no additional code is provided, there's no evidence of malicious activity, suspicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple import statement snippet with no malicious intent or security concerns. It appears to be part of a larger codebase that is not included here.",
