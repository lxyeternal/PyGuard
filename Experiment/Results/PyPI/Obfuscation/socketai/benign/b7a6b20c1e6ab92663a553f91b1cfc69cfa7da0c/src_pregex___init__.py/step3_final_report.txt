{
  "purpose": "The code imports modules from the 'pregex' package, likely for regex operations, with no executable logic or suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'pregex.core' and 'pregex.meta' modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks present; code only imports modules.",
  "flows": "N/A – no runtime data flow or data processing occurs in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of anomalies; code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with no executable logic, data handling, or network activity. The import statements are from well-known open-source modules, and there are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate given the minimal and benign nature of the code. The high confidence levels reflect certainty that the code is safe. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The import statements are standard and do not pose any threat. The scores are justified and consistent with the code content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
