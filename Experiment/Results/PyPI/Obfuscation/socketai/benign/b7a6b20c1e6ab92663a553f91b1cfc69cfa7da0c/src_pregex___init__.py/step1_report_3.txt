{
  "purpose": "The code imports modules from the pregex package, specifically from pregex.core and pregex.meta, likely to utilize regex-related functionality.",
  "sources": "Imports from pregex.core and pregex.meta modules",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data handling or output functions shown",
  "flows": "No data flow observed; only imports without further code execution",
  "anomalies": "Absence of actual code; only import statements with no usage or data processing, which is unusual but not inherently malicious",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from the pregex library, which is used for regex pattern matching and related operations. There is no input handling, data processing, or output. The lack of additional code makes it difficult to determine intent or potential malicious behavior. The imports themselves are standard for utilizing the pregex package. No suspicious behavior or malicious code is evident from these lines alone.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet contains only import statements and no executable or malicious code. It does not exhibit any malicious intent or security risks based on the provided content.",
