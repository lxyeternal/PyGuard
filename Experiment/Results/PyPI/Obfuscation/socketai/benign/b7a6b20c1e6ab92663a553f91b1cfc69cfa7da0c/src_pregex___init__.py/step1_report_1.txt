{
  "purpose": "The code imports modules 'core' and 'meta' from the 'pregex' package, likely for pattern matching or regex operations.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'pregex.core' and 'pregex.meta'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data is processed or output in this fragment.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow beyond module importation.",
  "anomalies": "Only import statements are present; no suspicious or unusual code features, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for modules within the 'pregex' package. These imports suggest the code relies on third-party libraries related to regex operations. There is no executable logic, data input, or output. Import statements themselves are benign, but the overall security depends on the use of these modules elsewhere in the project. As presented, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this minimal snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet contains only benign import statements with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It does not perform any suspicious actions or contain malicious code. Overall risk is minimal, but further context from the rest of the codebase would be necessary for a comprehensive security assessment.",
