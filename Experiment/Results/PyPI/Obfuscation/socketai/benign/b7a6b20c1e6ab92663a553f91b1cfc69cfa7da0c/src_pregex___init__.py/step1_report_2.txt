  "purpose": "The code imports modules 'core' and 'meta' from the 'pregex' package, likely for pattern or regex operations.",
  "sources": "Imports from external 'pregex' package modules.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as data output, network communication, or file writing detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows are limited to internal import statements; no execution or data processing evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of import statements with no additional logic or data handling; no anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two modules from the 'pregex' package, which is an open-source library for regular expressions. There are no functions, data inputs, or outputs present. Without further code, there is no indication of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity. The import statements are standard and do not pose security concerns by themselves.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simply importing modules from a legitimate open-source package. No malicious activity, malicious code, or security risks are evident based solely on these import statements.",
