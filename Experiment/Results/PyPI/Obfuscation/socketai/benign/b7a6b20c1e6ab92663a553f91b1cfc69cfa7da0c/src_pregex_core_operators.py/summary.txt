  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated pattern manipulation classes with no direct evidence of malicious activity. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware and risk scores remain low, reflecting the absence of concrete malicious actions. Continued dynamic analysis and review of invoked methods are recommended to ensure no hidden malicious behavior."
