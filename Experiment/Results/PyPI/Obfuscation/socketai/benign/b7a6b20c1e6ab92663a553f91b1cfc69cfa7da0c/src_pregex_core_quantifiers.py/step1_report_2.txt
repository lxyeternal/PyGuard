{
  "purpose": "Defines various quantifier classes for pattern matching with different repetition rules, extending a base class from pregex.core.pre.",
  "sources": "Imports from pregex.core.pre, input parameters to class constructors, lambda functions within constructors",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable if input parameters are untrusted and used in insecure ways, such as in regex processing or lambda functions",
  "flows": "Input parameters passed from instantiation to superclass constructors, some lambda functions used internally for pattern repetition logic",
  "anomalies": "Use of lambda functions with parameters, no clear hardcoded secrets or credentials, no network operations, no file manipulations, no obfuscated code features",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines classes that extend a base pattern quantifier class. The constructors take input parameters which include pattern specifications and configuration flags. These are passed to the superclass constructors, sometimes wrapped in lambda functions for dynamic pattern behavior. The code relies on external modules and standard Python features without any suspicious or malicious constructs. No hardcoded credentials, no network calls, no file operations, and no obfuscated logic are present. The purpose appears to be pattern matching extension, with no indications of malicious intent or malware behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard extension of pattern quantifier classes with no signs of malicious activity. It appears to be a legitimate part of a regex pattern library, with safe usage of parameters and no suspicious behaviors.",
