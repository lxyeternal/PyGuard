{
  "purpose": "Static import statements with obfuscated class names, no executable code or data flow, no evidence of malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Import statements from pregex.core and pregex.core.pre modules, including potentially obfuscated class aliases.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data or untrusted input processing observed.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; only static imports without runtime behavior.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of highly obfuscated class names and aliases, which could be used to hide malicious intent or obfuscate functionality.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with obfuscated identifiers, indicating static code with no execution or data handling. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious activity. Malware scores are appropriately zero, and obfuscation scores are moderate to high, justified by the naming patterns. Security risk remains low due to lack of active code or data flow. The static nature and absence of suspicious behaviors suggest benign intent, but obfuscation warrants further review if the source is untrusted.",
  "conclusion": "The code is static import statements with obfuscated class names, no malicious behavior detected. Obfuscation is notable but not sufficient to assign high malware risk. Overall, the supply chain appears benign, with caution advised regarding obfuscated identifiers.",
