{
  "purpose": "Defines classes representing special characters, each class encapsulates a specific Unicode character or symbol, primarily for use in regular expressions or text processing.",
  "sources": "Class constructors that initialize character representations, notably super().__init__ calls with specific character strings.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted input or data; no network, file, or environment interaction observed.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of classes leads to calls to super().__init__ with static string arguments; no data flow from external sources is present.",
  "anomalies": "All character data are hardcoded and static; no dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected. No credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions representing special characters with fixed Unicode or escape sequences. Each class inherits from a base imported class, initializing with a specific character. No input processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The code appears straightforward and benign, aimed at providing symbol tokens for other modules.\n\nNo signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. The structure and content are consistent with utility classes for text or regex handling, with no embedded malware or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is benign, comprising static class definitions for special characters with no malicious intent or security risks.",
