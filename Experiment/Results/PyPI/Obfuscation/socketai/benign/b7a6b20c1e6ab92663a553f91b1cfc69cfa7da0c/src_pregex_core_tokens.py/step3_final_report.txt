{
  "purpose": "Defines static classes representing special characters for regex tokenization or similar purposes, ensuring consistent character handling.",
  "sources": "Class constructors initializing with hardcoded string or Unicode literals; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data flows; static data used solely within class definitions.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of classes with fixed character data; no dynamic or untrusted data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or dynamic code; all code is static and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static class definitions for special characters, inheriting from a base class. There are no external inputs, network operations, or dynamic behaviors. The classes serve as tokens, with constructors initializing with fixed strings or Unicode characters. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are detected. The code's simplicity and static nature indicate benign utility classes for regex processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and free of malicious activity or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify its safety. The slight security risk score of 0.2 in one report is unwarranted; it should be 0.0. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
