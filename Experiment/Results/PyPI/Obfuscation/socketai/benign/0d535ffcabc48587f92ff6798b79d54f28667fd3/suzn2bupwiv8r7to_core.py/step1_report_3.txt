{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform symbolic algebraic computations, constraint solving, and function decoration using sympy and introspection tools. It is likely designed for mathematical or symbolic computation workflows.",
  "sources": "Reads symbolic expressions, function signatures, and symbolic variables; extracts symbols from expressions; reads input data for function wrapping.",
  "sinks": "Uses sympy.solve and sympy.lambdify which process symbolic expressions, but do not directly execute untrusted data; no external network or system commands observed.",
  "flows": "Symbolic expressions are analyzed for symbols (sources), then constraints are solved via sympy.solve, with results fed into function calls and symbol substitutions; decorated functions execute with modified signatures.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a large, seemingly random identifier in an imported module (LIBepIQANrhhTAYaRxtInDMcYiHAClvd), obfuscated variable names, dynamic symbol creation, and function wrapping which could hide malicious behavior. The code performs complex symbol substitution and function wrapping which could potentially be used for obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a symbolic manipulation library utilizing sympy for solving equations and wrapping functions for symbolic parameter handling. It contains utility functions to extract symbols from expressions, a custom exception class, and a system for dynamically modifying functions' signatures. The use of dynamic symbol creation, complex function wrapping, and the obfuscated identifiers suggests potential for misuse. However, all operations involve symbolic algebra and do not show direct evidence of malicious activities such as network activity, file manipulation, or data exfiltration. The obfuscation of identifiers and dynamic code modifications could be a vector for malicious intent, but based solely on static code analysis, there is no conclusive evidence of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs advanced symbolic algebra and function decoration, which could be used maliciously to hide malicious payloads or behavior. Nonetheless, it operates within the realm of symbolic computation without evident malicious actions like network access or data theft. The obfuscated identifiers and complex dynamic modifications increase suspicion but do not definitively indicate malicious intent.",
