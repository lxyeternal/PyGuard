{
  "purpose": "The code implements symbolic algebra operations, including solving systems of equations, managing constraints, and wrapping functions for symbolic computation.",
  "sources": "Inputs include symbolic expressions, function arguments, and symbolic variables created dynamically or passed into functions like 'AeytSwSfaxXjORkfZnfOpupASEjWXboJ'.",
  "sinks": "Uses sympy.solve, subs, lambdify, and expression evaluation, which can process untrusted symbolic inputs potentially leading to resource exhaustion or unintended behavior.",
  "flows": "Untrusted symbolic expressions flow into 'sympy.solve', 'subs', and 'lambdify', with data passed through dynamic substitutions and symbolic solving routines.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of heavily obfuscated variable names, dynamic symbol creation, import of strange symbols from sympy, and dynamic method modifications suggest obfuscation and potential concealment of malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a complex symbolic algebra utility that performs constraint solving, substitution, and function wrapping. It employs dynamic symbol creation and obfuscation, which can be exploited to hide malicious behavior. No explicit malicious commands or network activity are present. The use of sympy functions poses a risk of resource exhaustion if malicious symbolic expressions are supplied. The obfuscation and dynamic features increase the difficulty of static analysis but do not inherently indicate malicious intent. The malware score is low (0.2), reflecting the absence of active malicious code, while the obfuscation score is high (around 0.7), indicating significant code concealment. The overall security risk is moderate (around 0.4), primarily due to potential misuse via symbolic inputs and resource exhaustion vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate symbolic mathematics utility with substantial obfuscation and dynamic features. While no direct malicious activity is evident, the obfuscation and complexity warrant caution, especially if used with untrusted inputs. The primary security concern is resource exhaustion or misuse through symbolic expressions, not active malware.",
