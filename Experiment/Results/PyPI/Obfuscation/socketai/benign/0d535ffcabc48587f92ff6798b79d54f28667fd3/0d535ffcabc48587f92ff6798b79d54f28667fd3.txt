      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate symbolic mathematics utility with substantial obfuscation and dynamic features. While no direct malicious activity is evident, the obfuscation and complexity warrant caution, especially if used with untrusted inputs. The primary security concern is resource exhaustion or misuse through symbolic expressions, not active malware."
