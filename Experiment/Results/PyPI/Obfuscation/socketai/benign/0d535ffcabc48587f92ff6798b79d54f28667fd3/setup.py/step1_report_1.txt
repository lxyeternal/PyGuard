{
  "purpose": "Set up a Python package named 'constraintula' with metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'README.md' for description; reads from 'constraintula/__init__.py' to extract version string.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly writes to external systems, network, or files other than reading local files.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from '__init__.py' and description from README.md; passes these to setuptools.setup.",
  "anomalies": "The variable names are obfuscated and unusual, but they do not perform any malicious operations. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code reads the project description and version string from specific files and uses setuptools to configure package setup. Variable names are obfuscated but do not appear to serve malicious purposes. No network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection observed. The code performs standard setup tasks with normal dependencies and metadata. No signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. Despite obfuscated variable names, there is no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security threats.",
