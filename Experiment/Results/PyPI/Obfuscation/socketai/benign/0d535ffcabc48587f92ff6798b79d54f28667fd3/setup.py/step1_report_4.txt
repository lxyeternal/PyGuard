  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'constraintula' Python package, primarily for package configuration and dependency management.",
  "sources": "Reads from README.md for description, reads from 'constraintula/__init__.py' to extract version string.",
  "sinks": "Uses setuptools.setup() to define package metadata and dependencies.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from init file → passes metadata to setuptools.setup()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; the code performs standard setup tasks. The regex for version extraction is straightforward. No obfuscated code or unusual patterns. Dependency list includes standard packages with conditional dependency, no malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a version string from the '__init__.py' file using a simple regex and raises an error if not found, which is standard. Reads description content from a README.md file. The setup configuration uses these values along with other metadata. The dependencies are typical, and no suspicious code or network activity is present. No anomalies or malicious patterns are identified. The code appears to perform a legitimate package setup without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It reads data from files, performs normal dependency setup, and does not include any suspicious or malicious code components.",
