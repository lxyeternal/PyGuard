{
  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script that reads version info and description files, then calls setuptools.setup() with package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads version string from 'constraintula/__init__.py' via regex; reads description from 'README.md'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Reads files -> extracts version -> passes metadata to setuptools.setup().",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are obfuscated and unusual but do not perform malicious actions; no suspicious code patterns or external data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical setup tasks: file reading, regex extraction, and calling setuptools.setup(). Variable obfuscation is superficial and does not indicate malicious intent. No network activity, data leaks, code injection, or malicious behaviors are present. The obfuscation level is high but benign, and the code structure is straightforward. No hardcoded secrets or vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malware, malicious backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. The high obfuscation does not imply malicious intent, and the overall security risk is negligible.",
