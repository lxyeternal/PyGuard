{
  "purpose": "This code sets up a Python package named 'constraintula' by reading version information and description from files, and configuring dependencies and metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads version string from 'constraintula/__init__.py' using regex; reads package description from 'README.md'; defines dependencies and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that handle untrusted data; no network, file write, or data leak operations are evident.",
  "flows": "Version string extracted from '__init__.py' file is used directly in setup configuration; description is read from markdown file and assigned to package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. The regex pattern for extracting version appears straightforward. No external data is fetched or sent. The code primarily performs file I/O and setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup tasks for a Python package. It extracts version info with regex, reads a description file, and invokes setuptools.setup() with package metadata and dependencies. All operations are typical for package distribution. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious code execution are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It reads necessary files and configures package metadata securely. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are evident.",
