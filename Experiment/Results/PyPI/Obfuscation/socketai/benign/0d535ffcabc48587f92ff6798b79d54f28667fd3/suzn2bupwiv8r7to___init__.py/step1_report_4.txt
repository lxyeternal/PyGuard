{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be importing specific functions from the sympy library and some modules from a relative core package, then defining a version string.",
  "sources": "Imports from sympy and local core modules, and a version string assignment.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that process untrusted data or perform potentially harmful actions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from imported modules to the script's context, with no evident transmission to external systems or dangerous operations.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual import of sympy with a non-standard module 'LIBepIQANrhhTAYaRxtInDMcYiHAClvd' which appears obfuscated or non-standard; the core module's imported symbols are obfuscated names, indicating possible code hiding or obfuscation. The version string is straightforward but placed in an unusual manner.",
  "analysis": "The code imports symbolic computation functions from sympy, including 'sqrt' and 'Symbol', which are standard. However, it also imports an obscure, non-standard module 'LIBepIQANrhhTAYaRxtInDMcYiHAClvd', which is suspicious due to its non-descriptive name and possible obfuscation. The local module 'core' is imported with multiple obfuscated symbols, suggesting code hiding or intentional obfuscation. The assignment of the version string '0.3.1' is straightforward and not inherently malicious but placed amidst obfuscated imports, raising suspicion about intent. Overall, there are no active malicious behaviors such as network connections or data exfiltration, but the obfuscation and unusual import pattern merit caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated imports and an unusual module name, which could be part of code hiding or obfuscation techniques. There is no evidence of malicious actions such as data theft or network activity. The main concern is potential concealment or malicious intent hidden within obfuscated symbols, but based solely on this snippet, it does not appear to perform harmful actions.",
