{
  "purpose": "Analyze the provided Python code snippet for potential malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks, focusing on import patterns and code structure.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'sympy' including 'LIBepIQANrhhTAYaRxtInDMcYiHAClvd' and local module '.core' with obfuscated identifiers.",
  "sinks": "No runtime data flows, network connections, or data exfiltration points are present in the static code.",
  "flows": "The code imports symbols and modules, but no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks are evident.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated import symbol 'LIBepIQANrhhTAYaRxtInDMcYiHAClvd', nonsensical local module and variable names, and absence of functional code.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only import statements and a version string assignment, with suspiciously obfuscated symbols and module names. No malicious actions or data flows are visible. The obfuscation suggests concealment, but without runtime or deeper static analysis, no definitive malicious activity can be confirmed. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.2, obfuscated ~0.7, risk ~0.3-0.4) are consistent with the observed obfuscation and lack of active malicious behavior. Further analysis of the imported symbol and the '.core' module is recommended to clarify intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears primarily benign but contains obfuscation that warrants further investigation. No active malicious activity is evident at this stage. The current scores are appropriate, reflecting suspicion due to obfuscation but no confirmed malicious actions.",
