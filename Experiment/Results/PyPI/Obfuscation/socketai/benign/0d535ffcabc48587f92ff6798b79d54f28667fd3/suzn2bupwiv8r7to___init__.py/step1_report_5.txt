{
  "purpose": "The code appears to import mathematical functions and symbols, and define a version string for a package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from sympy for sqrt, Symbol, and an obfuscated or suspicious module name LIBepIQANrhhTAYaRxtInDMcYiHAClvd; local import from a core module for several obfuscated identifiers; version string definition.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly interacts with external inputs or untrusted data sources; no sinks related to data leaks, network, or system modification are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the imports and version string are static and do not process untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "The import from sympy includes a suspicious or obfuscated module name LIBepIQANrhhTAYaRxtInDMcYiHAClvd which is unusual and possibly malicious. The imported identifiers from the local core module are also obfuscated, which could be an attempt to hide malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard mathematical functions from sympy, which is normal. However, it also imports a module with a highly obfuscated name, which is suspicious. The local import includes several obfuscated identifiers, which could be harmless or could hide malicious code. The version string is standard. There is no evident malicious behavior in this snippet alone, but the obfuscated import suggests potential malicious intent or concealment.",
  "conclusion": "This code by itself does not perform malicious actions but contains suspicious obfuscated import names that warrant further investigation. The overall risk is moderate due to the obfuscation, but no direct malicious activity is evident from this fragment.",
