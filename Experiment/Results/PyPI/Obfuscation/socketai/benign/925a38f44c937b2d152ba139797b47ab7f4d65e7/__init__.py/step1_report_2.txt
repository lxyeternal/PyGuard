{
  "purpose": "Extend the module's search path for package resources using pkgutil.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and uses '__import__' to extend '__path__' with the current module's name.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data or output is generated or affected.",
  "flows": "The code imports a standard library module and modifies a module attribute; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and typical for namespace package support; no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code uses '__import__' to load 'pkgutil' dynamically, then extends '__path__' with 'extend_path', which is standard for namespace packages. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic are present. The use of '__import__' is explicit but common in dynamic imports; the code’s purpose is to support namespace package extension. No obfuscation, external data sources, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard pattern for supporting namespace packages in Python. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet.",
