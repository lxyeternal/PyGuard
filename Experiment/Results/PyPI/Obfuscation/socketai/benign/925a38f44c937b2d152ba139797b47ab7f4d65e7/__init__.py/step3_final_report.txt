  "purpose": "Support namespace package functionality by extending the package search path.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it dynamically imports 'pkgutil' and modifies '__path__'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external data flows; no sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and extends '__path__', which is a standard operation with no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward, standard pattern for namespace packages.",
  "analysis": "The code uses '__import__' to dynamically import 'pkgutil' and calls 'extend_path' to modify '__path__', enabling namespace package support. This pattern is common and benign in Python packaging. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is clear, not obfuscated, and aligns with standard practices. The use of dynamic import is typical in such contexts and does not introduce security risks. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs are found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign pattern for supporting namespace packages in Python. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk. The scores should reflect this.",
