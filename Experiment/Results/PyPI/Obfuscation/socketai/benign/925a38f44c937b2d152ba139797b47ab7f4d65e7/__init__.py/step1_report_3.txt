{
  "purpose": "Extend the module's search path for package discovery using pkgutil.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and accesses '__path__' and '__name__' built-in variables.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks where untrusted data could cause leaks or harm are present.",
  "flows": "The code takes '__path__' and '__name__' as inputs, processes them with 'pkgutil.extend_path', and assigns back to '__path__'.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs a standard package initialization step; no unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkgutil' module, then extends the '__path__' variable for the current package using 'extend_path'. This is a common pattern in namespace packages to support multi-directory packages. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious logic. The code is minimal and appears standard for package initialization.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a standard package initialization statement used for namespace packages and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
