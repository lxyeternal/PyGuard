  "purpose": "Extend the package search path for modular or namespace packages",
  "sources": "__import__('pkgutil').extend_path(__path__, __name__)",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data leakage or untrusted data processing",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "Use of __import__ to dynamically import 'pkgutil' is somewhat uncommon but not inherently malicious; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors observed",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports the 'pkgutil' module and calls its 'extend_path' function, passing __path__ and __name__ as arguments. This pattern is typically used in namespace packages to extend the search path for modules. No suspicious or malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection, is evident. The code is minimal, standard for namespace packages, and does not perform any external network or file operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard namespace package pattern with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It simply extends the package search path, which is a common practice in Python package management.",
