  "purpose": "Extending the module search path for package namespace support using pkgutil.",
  "sources": "__import__('pkgutil').extend_path(__path__, __name__)",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "Usage of dynamic import and modification of __path__, which is typical for namespace packages but can be misused in malicious contexts. No malicious behavior evident.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports the 'pkgutil' module and extends the __path__ variable for the current package, enabling namespace package functionality. There are no signs of data leakage, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior. This pattern is standard in namespace package support. No obfuscated code or suspicious operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for supporting namespace packages in Python. It does not exhibit malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
