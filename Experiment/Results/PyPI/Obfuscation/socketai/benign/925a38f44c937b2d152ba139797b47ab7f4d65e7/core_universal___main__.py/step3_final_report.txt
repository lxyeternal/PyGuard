{
  "purpose": "Execute an external command specified by an imported, obfuscated variable, passing command-line arguments directly.",
  "sources": "Import from .server module; command-line arguments sys.argv[1:].",
  "sinks": "subprocess.call() executing the imported variable as a command.",
  "flows": "Imported variable -> subprocess.call() -> system execution with sys.argv[1:].",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable name; no validation or sanitization of imported command or arguments; minimal error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code imports an obfuscated variable intended as a command, then executes it with user-provided arguments without validation, creating a high risk of malicious activity. The pattern resembles a backdoor or malicious loader, especially given the lack of validation and obfuscation. The code's behavior is consistent with potential malicious intent, and the high obfuscation score reflects this. The execution of external commands based on untrusted, obfuscated input is a significant security concern, justifying high malware and risk scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code pattern indicates a high potential for malicious activity, resembling a backdoor or malicious loader, especially if the imported variable is controlled or manipulated. The obfuscation and lack of validation significantly elevate security risks, warranting cautious treatment and further investigation.",
