  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate SDK server launcher with obfuscation that could be used to hide malicious intent. No active malware or backdoors are evident, but the obfuscation and lack of validation warrant cautious review. The current scores are appropriate; malware is low, obfuscation is high, and overall risk is moderate due to potential misuse."
