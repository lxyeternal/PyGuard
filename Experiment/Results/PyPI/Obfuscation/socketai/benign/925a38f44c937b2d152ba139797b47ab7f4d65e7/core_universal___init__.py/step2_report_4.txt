  "review": "Let's analyze the situation carefully.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if reported issues are present in the code**\n\n- The reports contain only \"Empty response\" messages, providing no details about the actual security issues, vulnerabilities, or suspicious behavior.\n- Without specific raw responses or detailed descriptions, I cannot verify if any issues are present in the code.\n- **Conclusion:** Based solely on the provided data, I cannot confirm the presence of specific issues.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic, reasoning, or summary**\n\n- The reports lack content; they do not describe any vulnerabilities, suspicious activity, or anomalies.\n- The report summaries are not informative; they provide no context or evidence.\n- **Conclusion:** The reports are essentially empty and do not contain any actionable information or reasoning flaws.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores given to each issue and suggest changes**\n\n- Since no issues are described, no scores are provided.\n- **Conclusion:** No scores to review or adjust.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Justify any risk score higher than 0.5**\n\n- No issues or risks are described, so no justification is needed.\n- **Conclusion:** No risk scores to justify.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Malware score considerations**\n\n- The code provided appears to be a straightforward utility for version retrieval and environment variable parsing.\n- There is no indication of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or hidden payloads.\n- The code does include dynamic imports and environment variable checks, which are common but not inherently malicious.\n- **Conclusion:** Malware score should be low; no malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6: Challenge claims based on assumptions**\n\n- Since the reports are empty, there are no claims to challenge.\n- The code itself doesn't show any suspicious or malicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n**Step 7: Consistency of scores with the report**\n\n- No scores are provided; thus, no inconsistency exists.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Code review:** The code appears benign, with no evident vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n- **Report content:** Empty; no evidence or reasoning provided.\n- **Scores:** Not applicable due to lack of reported issues.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n**Malware score:** 0.0 — no signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** 0.0 — code is readable and straightforward.\n\n**Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal risk due to use of dynamic imports and environment variables, but nothing malicious or vulnerable.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe provided code is simple, standard, and does not demonstrate any security issues. The reports are empty, so no further analysis or action is warranted.",
