  "conclusion": "The code is an obfuscated, non-malicious abstract class primarily serving as a structural placeholder. There is no evidence of malware or active security threats. The obfuscation is likely intentional but does not translate into malicious intent. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score should remain at 0."
