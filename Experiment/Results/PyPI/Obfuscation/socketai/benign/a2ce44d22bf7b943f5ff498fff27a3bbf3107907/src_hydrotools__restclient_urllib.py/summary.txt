  "conclusion": "The code is a benign URL utility module with obfuscated variable names. No signs of malware or malicious behavior are detected. The high obfuscation score is justified, but the malware score remains at 0. The security risk is moderate due to potential misuse with untrusted inputs, but no active threats are present."
