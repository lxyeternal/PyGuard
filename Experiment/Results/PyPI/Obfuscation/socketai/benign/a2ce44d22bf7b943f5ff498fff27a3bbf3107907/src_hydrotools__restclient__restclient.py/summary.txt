  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, albeit heavily obfuscated, HTTP client component with no evidence of malicious activity. The obfuscation warrants cautious monitoring, but current analysis indicates a benign purpose. Malware score should remain low, with a slightly elevated obfuscation score due to naming complexity."
