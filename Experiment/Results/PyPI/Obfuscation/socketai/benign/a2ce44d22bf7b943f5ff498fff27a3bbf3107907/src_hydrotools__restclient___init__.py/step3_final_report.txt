{
  "purpose": "This code imports internal modules with obfuscated identifiers, likely for modularization or proprietary reasons.",
  "sources": "Internal module files and their obfuscated identifiers",
  "sinks": "No external data, network calls, or data sinks are present",
  "flows": "Import statements do not establish data flows or external interactions",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated or non-descriptive identifiers, but no malicious behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from internal modules with obfuscated names. No runtime logic, data handling, or external communication is evident. The obfuscation may be due to auto-generation or proprietary naming, not necessarily malicious. All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious activity, with malware scores at 0, and assign high obfuscation scores (~0.75-0.8). The low security risk (~0.2) aligns with the lack of suspicious behavior. No evidence suggests malicious intent or security vulnerabilities in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with obfuscation being the only notable feature. The malware score is 0, and the low risk score is appropriate. Further review of the entire package is recommended if obfuscation is pervasive or unexplained, but based solely on this snippet, the supply chain risk is minimal.",
