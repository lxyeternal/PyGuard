  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for managing asyncio coroutines, including running coroutines synchronously with fallback to nest_asyncio, creating async wrappers around callables, and wrapping coroutines for synchronous execution.",
  "sources": "Input coroutines, callables passed to zIziOboWNIOPVPbsfKqlVdARxaCJQpPs, arguments to these functions",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network communication, or data exfiltration observed",
  "flows": "Input coroutines or callables flow through the utility functions, ultimately executed via asyncio event loop or wrapped for synchronous use",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of variable and function names; typo in error message ('nest_asycnio') which appears to be benign",
  "analysis": "The code defines three functions: one to run a coroutine until complete with fallback to nest_asyncio, one to create an async wrapper around a callable, and one to wrap a coroutine for synchronous execution. The variable and function names are intentionally obfuscated, but the logic is standard asyncio pattern. No network activity, data exfiltration, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code detected. The only notable anomaly is a typo in the error message, which is unlikely malicious. The code appears to be a utility module for async management, with obfuscation possibly for concealment but no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for asyncio coroutine management with obfuscated naming. No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The obfuscation is superficial and does not indicate malicious activity. Overall security risk is low.",
