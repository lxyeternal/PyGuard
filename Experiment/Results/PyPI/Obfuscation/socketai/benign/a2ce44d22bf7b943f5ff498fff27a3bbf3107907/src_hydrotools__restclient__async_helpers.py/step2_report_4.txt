  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Summary:** The code provides async utilities, runs coroutines, applies nest_asyncio if needed. Obfuscated variable names but no malicious behavior.  \n- **Assessment:** The logic is straightforward and typical for async management. No external data exfiltration or network activity. Obfuscation is superficial.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0.2, Obfuscated: 0.4 — reasonable.  \n- **Conclusion:** Benign utility code.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Summary:** Similar async utilities, with emphasis on obfuscated names and a typo in the error message ('nest_asycnio'). No malicious activity.  \n- **Assessment:** The typo might be accidental or a subtle attempt to mislead; however, it’s more likely a benign mistake. No network or data exfiltration.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0.2, Obfuscated: 0.2 — consistent.  \n- **Conclusion:** Utility code, obfuscation present but not malicious.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Summary:** Same pattern—async utilities, obfuscated names, no malicious behavior. The obfuscation is high, but no signs of malware.  \n- **Assessment:** No suspicious network activity, credentials, or backdoors.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0.2, Obfuscated: 0.7 — appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** Utility functions with obfuscation, no malicious intent.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Summary:** Similar async helpers, obfuscated names, no malicious activity.  \n- **Assessment:** No evidence of malware or malicious payloads.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0.2, Obfuscated: 0.7 — fitting.  \n- **Conclusion:** Benign utility code.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Summary:** Same as above, with obfuscated names, no malicious activity.  \n- **Assessment:** No signs of malware or security risk.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0.2, Obfuscated: 0.7 — consistent.  \n- **Conclusion:** Utility code, obfuscation not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Synthesis and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious behavior, no network activity, no data exfiltration, no backdoors. The obfuscation appears to be superficial or for code concealment, not malicious intent. Therefore, **malware score should be 0**.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The variable and function names are intentionally obscure, which can hinder readability but does not inherently indicate malicious intent. Given the consistent pattern, a score around **0.4 to 0.7** is justified, with 0.7 being appropriate due to the high obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Since the code is a utility for asyncio management with no malicious activity, the overall security risk remains low. A score of **0.2** is appropriate.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The current scores are reasonable, but to reflect the absence of malware more clearly, I suggest:\n  - **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious behavior detected)\n  - **Obfuscated score:** **0.6** (moderate obfuscation)\n  - **Risk score:** **0.2** (low security risk)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a set of asynchronous utility functions with obfuscated variable names. It does not exhibit malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The obfuscation seems to be a superficial attempt to hinder readability, but the logic remains benign. The overall security risk is low.",
