      "conclusion": "The code is a benign URL utility module with obfuscated variable names. No signs of malware or malicious behavior are detected. The high obfuscation score is justified, but the malware score remains at 0. The security risk is moderate due to potential misuse with untrusted inputs, but no active threats are present."

Further review of the entire package is recommended if obfuscation is pervasive or unexplained, but based solely on this snippet, the supply chain risk is minimal."

The obfuscation warrants cautious monitoring, but current analysis indicates a benign purpose. Malware score should remain low, with a slightly elevated obfuscation score due to naming complexity."

However, there is no direct evidence of malicious activity within this snippet. The risk is moderate, and further context is needed to determine if this is benign or malicious."

The obfuscation is likely intentional but does not translate into malicious intent. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score should remain at 0."
