  "purpose": "Define data structures and enumeration for URL encoding and decoding functions.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and defines objects; no external input handling observed.",
  "sinks": "Uses parse functions (quote, unquote, etc.) which could be vulnerable if fed untrusted data, but only as part of function calls.",
  "flows": "No evident data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; functions are merely wrappers around standard library methods.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variable names and class methods that dynamically invoke parse functions via stored callables. No hardcoded secrets or credentials. The code structure appears intentionally obfuscated, possibly to hide behavior, but only uses standard library functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines objects and data classes with obfuscated names. It creates an Enum class that maps to objects containing URL encoding/decoding functions from Python's urllib.parse module. Methods in the Enum dynamically invoke these stored callables, which could be used to process URL data. No actual input handling, data storage, or network activity is present. The code's obfuscation seems superficial, involving naming conventions and dynamic method calls, not malicious payloads. No suspicious external connections, data leaks, or backdoors are apparent. The primary concern is the obfuscated nature, which could be used to hide malicious intent, but given only this code, it appears to be a utility module with no malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a seemingly obfuscated utility module wrapping standard URL parsing functions. No direct malicious behavior or malware is evident. The obfuscation appears superficial and could be for code concealment, but the functionality relies solely on safe standard library calls.",
