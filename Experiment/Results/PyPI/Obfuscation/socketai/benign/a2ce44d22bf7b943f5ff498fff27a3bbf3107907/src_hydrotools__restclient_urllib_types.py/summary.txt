  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility wrapper around standard URL functions with superficial obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The low malware and risk scores assigned in the reports are appropriate. The obfuscation could be exploited if misused but, in isolation, does not pose a threat."
