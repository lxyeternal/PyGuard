{
  "purpose": "Define a data structure and enum for URL encoding and decoding functions, with dynamic method calls.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (dataclasses, enum, functools, typing, urllib.parse). No external data sources or input streams are evident.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic method calls on enum instances, potentially executing URL encoding/decoding functions.",
  "flows": "No clear data flow from untrusted input to sensitive sinks; dynamic method calls are used but rely on standard library functions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamically called functions via enum properties; creation of objects with obscure names; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious strings; no external data or network activity; class properties simply wrap standard parse functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an immutable dataclass containing callables for URL encoding/decoding. An enum encapsulates various such functions from urllib.parse, accessed via properties and methods that invoke these functions dynamically. There are no apparent malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The dynamic method invocation via enum members is unusual but not inherently malicious, especially since it wraps standard functions. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are present. The code appears to be a utility wrapper for URL encoding/decoding operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for managing URL encoding and decoding functions encapsulated in an enum. No malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks are detected. The dynamic method invocation is unusual but not malicious. Overall, this appears to be a standard, safe utility module.",
