      "conclusion": "The package appears benign with no active malicious behavior. The obfuscation and misconfiguration are suspicious but not conclusive of malicious intent. Given the absence of malicious code or vulnerabilities, the malware score is 0, and the overall security risk is low. Further static analysis or runtime monitoring is recommended if deploying."

The scores assigned are reasonable; the obfuscation warrants caution, but the malware risk remains low. Further investigation of the module and usage context is advised."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard API client with obfuscated variable names and coding issues but no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The malware score is set to 0, and the security risk is low (~0.45), primarily due to obfuscation and potential data leakage through logs. Further review should consider the broader context, but based solely on this fragment, it does not pose a security threat."
