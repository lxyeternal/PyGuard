  "purpose": "Standard setup script for a Python package, configuring metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Obfuscated variable assignments and parameters within the setup() function.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no network, file, or code execution points present.",
  "flows": "Obfuscated variables are used as arguments in setup(), but no malicious data flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, incorrect parameter names (e.g., license, python_requires), and invalid classifiers such as 'Programming Language :: SQL'.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py with obfuscated variable names and misused parameters. No malicious code, network activity, or malicious behavior is present. The obfuscation and configuration errors could indicate malicious intent or poor coding practices, but do not confirm malicious activity. The incorrect parameter names would likely cause setup failures, and the obfuscated variable names may be used to hide intent. No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads is detected. The code's benign appearance and lack of suspicious actions suggest low threat, but the obfuscation warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The package appears benign with no active malicious behavior. The obfuscation and misconfiguration are suspicious but not conclusive of malicious intent. Given the absence of malicious code or vulnerabilities, the malware score is 0, and the overall security risk is low. Further static analysis or runtime monitoring is recommended if deploying.",
