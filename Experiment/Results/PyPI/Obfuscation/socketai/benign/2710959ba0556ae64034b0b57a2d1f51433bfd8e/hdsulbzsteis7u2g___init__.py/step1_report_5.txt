  "purpose": "Import specific identifiers from a local module named 'athena_client'.",
  "sources": "The import statement accessing '.athena_client' module and its exported attributes.",
  "sinks": "Potentially none directly; however, if imported identifiers are used insecurely elsewhere, they could serve as data sinks.",
  "flows": "Imported identifiers could be used as data sources in subsequent code; no explicit flow present in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Identifiers 'bxqRsRvynnmdHrQbGCkHfUMTFGAJpeVn' and 'gXYDxotQpKUOQuBsTPXLYcOYuVIlkDxB' are obfuscated or randomly generated, which may suggest malicious intent or attempt at hiding functionality. The module name and identifiers do not have meaningful names.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single import statement importing two entities with non-descriptive, seemingly random names from a relative module 'athena_client'. Such naming patterns can be used to hide malicious code or backdoors. There are no signs of data leaks, environment variable misuse, or suspicious behavior in this snippet. However, the obfuscated identifiers are suspicious and could be part of a malicious backdoor or stealth mechanism. Without further context or usage, it's difficult to determine intent definitively. The code itself is minimal and lacks any active behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement alone does not show malicious behavior but the use of obfuscated identifiers raises suspicion. This pattern is often associated with hiding malicious or unauthorized code. Additional context is needed to confirm malicious intent, but caution is warranted.",
