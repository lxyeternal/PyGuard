  "conclusion": "The import statement is syntactically correct but suspicious due to obfuscated identifiers. There is no direct evidence of malicious activity in this snippet. The scores assigned are reasonable; the obfuscation warrants caution, but the malware risk remains low. Further investigation of the module and usage context is advised."
