  "purpose": "Standard Python namespace package declaration using pkg_resources or pkgutil fallback.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'pkg_resources' and 'pkgutil', modification of __path__.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "Import attempt from 'pkg_resources' to fallback 'pkgutil.extend_path' modifying __path__.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward, standard namespace declaration code.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to declare a namespace package by first importing 'declare_namespace' from 'pkg_resources'. If that fails, it falls back to extending __path__ with 'pkgutil.extend_path'. Both approaches are well-known and standard in Python packaging. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code does not handle untrusted data, perform network operations, or execute suspicious logic. The malware score is correctly set to 0, as there is no malicious intent. The security risk score is minimal (around 0.1 or 0), reflecting the benign nature of the code. Confidence in this assessment is high (1.0), given the simplicity and commonality of the pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign pattern for namespace package declaration in Python, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware and obfuscated scores are 0, and the security risk is negligible. Minor adjustments could set the security risk to 0 for more accuracy, but current scores are acceptable.",
