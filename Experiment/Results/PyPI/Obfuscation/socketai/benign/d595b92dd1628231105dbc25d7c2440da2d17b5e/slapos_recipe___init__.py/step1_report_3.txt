  "purpose": "Declare a namespace package for compatibility across different packaging tools.",
  "sources": "The import of 'pkg_resources' and the variable '__path__' declaration.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "Attempt to import 'pkg_resources' to declare namespace, fallback to 'pkgutil.extend_path' if ImportError occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard namespace declaration pattern. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to declare a namespace package using 'pkg_resources'. If 'pkg_resources' is unavailable, it falls back to using 'pkgutil.extend_path' to extend the package's __path__. Both approaches are standard practices for supporting namespace packages in Python. No input sources or data sinks are involved; the code does not handle untrusted data or perform network operations. The code structure is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or unusual behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard namespace package declaration used for compatibility and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
