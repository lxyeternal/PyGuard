{
  "purpose": "Declare a namespace package to allow the distribution of multiple packages under the same namespace",
  "sources": "The code reads the current module name (__name__) and potentially the __path__ variable",
  "sinks": "No sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects are present",
  "flows": "The code imports and calls declare_namespace with __name__, and optionally extends __path__ using extend_path",
  "anomalies": "Use of __import__('pkg_resources') for namespace declaration; standard approach, no suspicious activity",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to declare a namespace package using pkg_resources, falling back to pkgutil.extend_path if ImportError occurs. It reads __name__ and __path__, standard for namespace packages. No untrusted input, no data leakage, no suspicious behaviors detected. No malicious intent or obfuscation evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a common pattern for namespace package declaration in Python, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
