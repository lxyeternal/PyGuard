  "conclusion": "The code contains high-risk features such as dynamic code execution, obfuscation, and complex module handling, which could be exploited maliciously. Although no direct malicious activity is observed, the potential for abuse warrants a cautious approach. The overall malware score is estimated at 0.6, obfuscation at 0.75, and security risk at 0.65, reflecting significant concern over its dynamic and obfuscated nature."
