{
  "purpose": "This code declares a namespace package using either pkg_resources or pkgutil, enabling the package to be extended across multiple distributions.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module's name (__name__), and attempts to import 'pkg_resources' or 'pkgutil'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or write outputs.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing modules based on the presence of 'pkg_resources' and extending the namespace path if necessary.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a standard namespace package declaration with fallback import; no anomalies or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code tries to declare the current module as a namespace package. It first attempts to import 'pkg_resources' to call 'declare_namespace'. If that fails, it falls back to 'pkgutil.extend_path' to extend __path__. Both are standard methods for supporting namespace packages in Python. There are no indications of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and follows common namespace package patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of a namespace package declaration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
