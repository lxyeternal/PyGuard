  "purpose": "Establishes a namespace package for a Python module to support package extensibility and modularity.",
  "sources": "The import statement for 'pkg_resources' and the '__path__' variable extension.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data or untrusted input handling occurs that could lead to data leaks or execution effects.",
  "flows": "Importing 'pkg_resources' and calling 'declare_namespace' if available; falling back to 'extend_path' to modify '__path__' for namespace support.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior; the pattern is a common namespace package setup. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to declare the module as a namespace package using 'pkg_resources'. If 'pkg_resources' is not available, it falls back to extending the '__path__' with 'extend_path' from 'pkgutil'. This pattern is standard for supporting namespace packages in Python, particularly for distributed packages. There is no input handling, no data leaks, and no malicious code or obfuscated logic present. The code functions solely to set up package namespace configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace package setup with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
