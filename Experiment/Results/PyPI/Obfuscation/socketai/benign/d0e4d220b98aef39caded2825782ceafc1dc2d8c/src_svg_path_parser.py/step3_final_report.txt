{
  "purpose": "The code is a complex SVG path parser that interprets path command strings into geometric path objects and data structures for rendering or analysis.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from path command strings, regex matches for numbers, and path data split by delimiters.",
  "sinks": "There are no external data sinks; the code processes data internally without network transmission, file writing, or system modification.",
  "flows": "Input path strings are split and parsed into command tokens, which are then converted into floats, complex numbers, or booleans, and assembled into path objects.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are heavily obfuscated, and control flow is complex, but no malicious or suspicious code behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code performs SVG path data parsing, converting command characters into geometric representations. It uses regex for number extraction, set checks for command identification, and functions to convert data into appropriate types. No network, file, or system commands are present. Obfuscation appears superficial, likely for concealment or minification, but does not indicate malicious intent. The logic is consistent with standard SVG parsing routines, and no malicious signals such as data exfiltration, code injection, or sabotage are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate SVG path parser with superficial obfuscation. No malware or malicious behavior is evident. The high obfuscation score reflects variable naming but does not imply malicious intent. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score is zero, indicating no malicious activity.",
