{
  "purpose": "Module defines and exports path-related classes/functions for graphics/vector operations, serving as an interface layer.",
  "sources": "Obfuscated identifiers imported from local modules '.path' and '.parser'.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, I/O, or external interactions.",
  "flows": "None; static import/export statements without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated or nonsensical identifiers in import statements; no active logic or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with obfuscated names and an export list. No executable logic, data handling, or network activity is present. Obfuscation may be due to internal naming conventions or code generation rather than malicious intent. The absence of runtime behavior, secrets, or external communications indicates a benign module interface. The high obfuscation scores reflect the naming style but do not imply malicious behavior. Overall, the code appears to be a standard, non-malicious interface setup with obfuscated internal identifiers.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module interface with obfuscated internal identifiers. No evidence of malicious activity, security vulnerabilities, or data leaks is present. The obfuscation warrants further review of the imported modules for completeness, but based solely on this fragment, the security risk is negligible.",
