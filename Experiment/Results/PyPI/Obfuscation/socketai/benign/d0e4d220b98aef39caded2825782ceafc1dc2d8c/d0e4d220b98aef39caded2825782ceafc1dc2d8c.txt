      "conclusion": "The code is a benign module interface with obfuscated internal identifiers. No evidence of malicious activity, security vulnerabilities, or data leaks is present. The obfuscation warrants further review of the imported modules for completeness, but based solely on this fragment, the security risk is negligible."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate SVG path parser with superficial obfuscation. No malware or malicious behavior is evident. The high obfuscation score reflects variable naming but does not imply malicious intent. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score is zero, indicating no malicious activity."

      "conclusion": "The code is a sophisticated geometric library with notable obfuscation but no signs of malicious activity. The high obfuscation could be for concealment or complexity, but the core functions are benign. The malware score is 0, reflecting no malicious behavior. The obfuscation score is moderate (~0.6), justified by variable naming and code complexity. The security risk is low (~0.2), mainly due to obfuscation and complexity, but no external effects or malicious patterns are present."
