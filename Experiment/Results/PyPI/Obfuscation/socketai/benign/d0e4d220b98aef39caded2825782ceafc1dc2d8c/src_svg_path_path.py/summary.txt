  "conclusion": "The code is a sophisticated geometric library with notable obfuscation but no signs of malicious activity. The high obfuscation could be for concealment or complexity, but the core functions are benign. The malware score is 0, reflecting no malicious behavior. The obfuscation score is moderate (~0.6), justified by variable naming and code complexity. The security risk is low (~0.2), mainly due to obfuscation and complexity, but no external effects or malicious patterns are present."
