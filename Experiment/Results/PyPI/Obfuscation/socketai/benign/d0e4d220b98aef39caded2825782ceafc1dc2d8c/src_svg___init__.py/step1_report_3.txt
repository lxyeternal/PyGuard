{
  "purpose": "Extend the module's search path for package resources",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and calls extend_path() with __path__ and __name__",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks",
  "flows": "The code reads the __path__ and __name__ variables to extend the package path",
  "anomalies": "Uses __import__ with a string literal 'pkgutil', which is standard; no unusual code patterns or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically extends the module's __path__ attribute by importing 'pkgutil' and calling extend_path() with existing __path__ and __name__. This pattern is common in namespace packages to aggregate multiple directories. There are no hardcoded credentials, malicious functions, or suspicious behavior. The code is straightforward, utilizing standard Python mechanisms to modify package resource paths.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical pattern used for namespace package support and does not exhibit malicious intent or security issues.",
