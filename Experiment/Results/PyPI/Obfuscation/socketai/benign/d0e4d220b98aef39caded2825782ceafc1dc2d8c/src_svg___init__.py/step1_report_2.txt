  "purpose": "Extend the current module's search path for package data.",
  "sources": "__import__('pkgutil').extend_path(__path__, __name__)",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "Imports 'pkgutil', then calls 'extend_path' with '__path__' and '__name__' to modify module search paths.",
  "anomalies": "Uses dynamic import via __import__, which is common and not suspicious; no hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports the 'pkgutil' module and extends the module's search path (__path__) with its existing value, using __name__ as a namespace. This is standard practice for supporting namespace packages in Python. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or malicious code execution. No obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious data flows are detected. The code's function is clear and benign.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign pattern used for handling namespace packages in Python. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks in this code fragment.",
