  "purpose": "Extending the package's search path for namespace packages using pkgutil.",
  "sources": "__import__('pkgutil').extend_path(__path__, __name__)",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; standard extension of package path without external data or untrusted input",
  "flows": "No significant source-to-sink data flow; code modifies __path__ variable internally",
  "anomalies": "Uses dynamic import and modifies __path__, which is common for namespace packages, but no anomalies or secrets present",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports the 'pkgutil' module and extends the '__path__' attribute of the current package (__name__) to support namespace package distribution. This pattern is standard for Python namespace packages. There are no hardcoded credentials, network activity, or suspicious code behaviors. The code is concise, straightforward, and serves a legitimate purpose in package management. It does not contain obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard pattern for supporting namespace packages in Python and poses no security threats or malicious intent.",
