  "purpose": "Support for namespace packages in Python, allowing multiple directories to contribute to a package's namespace.",
  "sources": "The dynamic import of 'pkgutil' and the extension of '__path__' attribute.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code does not process external input or output.",
  "flows": "Import 'pkgutil' -> call 'extend_path' with '__path__' and '__name__' -> assign result to '__path__'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of standard Python namespace package pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code employs a standard, well-known pattern for supporting namespace packages in Python. It dynamically extends the '__path__' attribute using 'pkgutil.extend_path', which is a common practice. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The use of '__import__' is typical for dynamic imports but not suspicious here. No external data, network activity, or sensitive information handling is present. The code is minimal, clear, and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard pattern for namespace package support with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its nature, and the assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and justified.",
