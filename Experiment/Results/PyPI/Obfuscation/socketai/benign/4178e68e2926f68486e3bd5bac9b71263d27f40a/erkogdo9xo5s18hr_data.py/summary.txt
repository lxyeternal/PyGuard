  "conclusion": "The code is primarily a resource management utility with heavy obfuscation and external dependencies. No active malicious behavior is evident, though obfuscation and reliance on external URLs warrant cautious monitoring. The assigned scores are consistent with the analysis, indicating low malware risk but moderate obfuscation and supply chain considerations."
