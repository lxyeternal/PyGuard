  "conclusion": "Despite heavy obfuscation, the code appears to be a legitimate spatial data analysis tool with no evidence of malicious activity. The obfuscation likely aims to hinder reverse engineering but does not constitute malicious behavior. The malware score is 0.0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2), primarily due to the difficulty in understanding the code rather than any active malicious intent."
