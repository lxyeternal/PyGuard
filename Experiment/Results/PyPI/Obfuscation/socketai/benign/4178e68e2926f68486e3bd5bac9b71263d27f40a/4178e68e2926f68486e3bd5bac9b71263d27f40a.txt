      "obfuscated": 0.8,
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "Despite heavy obfuscation, the code appears to be a legitimate spatial data analysis tool with no evidence of malicious activity. The obfuscation likely aims to hinder reverse engineering but does not constitute malicious behavior. The malware score is 0.0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2), primarily due to the difficulty in understanding the code rather than any active malicious intent."

      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The import statement is syntactically benign but suspicious due to obfuscated naming and unusual package. No direct malicious activity is evident, but further review of the package 'confluentfucci' and its contents is recommended before trusting or deploying this dependency. The current scores (malware: 0.2, obfuscated: 0.75, security risk: 0.4) are appropriate given the evidence."

      "obfuscated": 0.75,
      "confidence": 0.85,
      "conclusion": "The code is primarily a resource management utility with heavy obfuscation and external dependencies. No active malicious behavior is evident, though obfuscation and reliance on external URLs warrant cautious monitoring. The assigned scores are consistent with the analysis, indicating low malware risk but moderate obfuscation and supply chain considerations."

      "conclusion": "The code does not contain overt malicious payloads or backdoors. The primary security concern is external command execution and obfuscation, which could be exploited if inputs are untrusted. Overall, it appears to be a legitimate scientific workflow with moderate security risks."

      "conclusion": "The package appears to be a legitimate scientific analysis tool with low malware likelihood. The main security considerations involve external subprocess handling and obfuscation, which should be validated and sanitized during supply chain review. No evidence of malicious payloads or sabotage was found."
