{
  "purpose": "A GUI-based scientific image analysis tool for microscopy data, involving segmentation, tracking, visualization, and external process invocation.",
  "sources": "Reads image files, model files, environment variables, user inputs, and external scripts via subprocesses.",
  "sinks": "External subprocesses (e.g., Fiji/ImageJ, Python scripts), file outputs (CSV, HDF5, TIFF), terminal logs, environment variables.",
  "flows": "User inputs/processes → subprocess calls and file I/O → visualization and data export.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and class names, dynamic subprocess calls with environment variables, reliance on external scripts, use of 'try-except' blocks without specific handling, references to Docker environment variables.",
  "analysis": "The code is complex, GUI-driven, interacts with external tools, and employs obfuscation likely for concealment. No explicit malicious payloads, backdoors, or sabotage signals are evident. External subprocess calls and environment variable dependencies are typical in scientific workflows but could be exploited if inputs are maliciously controlled. The obfuscation and external process invocation warrant caution but do not directly indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The package appears to be a legitimate scientific analysis tool with low malware likelihood. The main security considerations involve external subprocess handling and obfuscation, which should be validated and sanitized during supply chain review. No evidence of malicious payloads or sabotage was found.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
