  "conclusion": "The import statement is syntactically benign but suspicious due to obfuscated naming and unusual package. No direct malicious activity is evident, but further review of the package 'confluentfucci' and its contents is recommended before trusting or deploying this dependency. The current scores (malware: 0.2, obfuscated: 0.75, security risk: 0.4) are appropriate given the evidence."
