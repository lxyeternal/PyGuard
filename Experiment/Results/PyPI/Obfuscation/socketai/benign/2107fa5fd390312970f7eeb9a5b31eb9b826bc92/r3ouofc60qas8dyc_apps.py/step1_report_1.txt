  "purpose": "Define a Django application configuration class with obfuscated attribute names",
  "sources": "The class definition and attribute assignments within the AppConfig subclass",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks of untrusted data; no data processing or output points",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static attribute assignments with no runtime data handling",
  "anomalies": "Use of seemingly random, obfuscated attribute names; no clear purpose or standard naming conventions; string values are simple and not suspicious in isolation",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django AppConfig subclass with obfuscated attribute names assigned string values. There is no input/output, no dynamic execution, no external data handling, or network activity. The obfuscation may suggest an attempt to hide intent or simply an unconventional coding style, but no malicious behavior is evident. The attribute values such as 'impostor' and 'django.db.models.AutoField' are harmless strings; no code injection or malicious logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Django configuration class with obfuscated attribute names. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. The obfuscation may be benign or for proprietary reasons, but it does not introduce any security concern.",
