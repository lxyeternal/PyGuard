  "purpose": "Define a Django application configuration class with some class variables assigned to string values.",
  "sources": "Class variables assigned with string literals; no input reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources; no data leaks or malicious effects identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code only defines static variables.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual class and variable names that appear obfuscated or randomly generated; no actual malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django AppConfig subclass with obfuscated class and variable names. The class variables are statically assigned string values, with no input processing, external calls, or dynamic code execution. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The naming pattern may suggest obfuscation or code hiding, but it does not inherently indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code appears benign but potentially intentionally obfuscated.",
  "conclusion": "The code is likely obfuscated but contains no clear malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a harmless Django configuration class with obfuscated naming, possibly for concealment but without malicious intent.",
