  "purpose": "Obfuscated Django admin customization for managing impostor data, overriding GET methods, and rendering templates.",
  "sources": "Request objects in overridden methods, class attributes, and import statements.",
  "sinks": "Super() method calls, render functions, and template rendering.",
  "flows": "Request data flows through overridden GET methods to superclass and templates.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated import alias, random class and variable names, malformed import statement in one report, no documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Django admin extension with superficial obfuscation through naming. No malicious code, network activity, or data exfiltration is evident. The suspicious import in report 5 is unusual and could indicate an attempt to hide dependencies but does not directly execute malicious actions. The obfuscation is consistent across reports and primarily superficial, not indicative of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign Django admin customization with high obfuscation. No active malicious behavior is detected. The suspicious import in report 5 warrants further dependency verification but does not confirm malware. Overall security risk remains low.",
