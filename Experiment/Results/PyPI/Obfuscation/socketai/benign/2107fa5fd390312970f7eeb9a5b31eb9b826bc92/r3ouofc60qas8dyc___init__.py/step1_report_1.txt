{
  "purpose": "The code appears to store version information and personal contact details, possibly for configuration or identification purposes.",
  "sources": "Data is assigned directly to variables; no external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No data is written to external systems, files, or transmitted over a network.",
  "flows": "No flow of data from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; variables are assigned static strings.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of personal email addresses and names stored in variables, which could be used for privacy violations if misused. No suspicious code constructs or obfuscation detected. No hardcoded credentials or secrets evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several variables with static values: version number, personal names, and email addresses. These could be used for configuration or identification, but do not show signs of malicious behavior. No external data sources, no data leaks, no network activity, and no suspicious code constructs are present. The contact info stored is benign but could be privacy-sensitive if accessed improperly.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple variable assignments containing version info and personal contact details. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears benign with no malware indicators.",
