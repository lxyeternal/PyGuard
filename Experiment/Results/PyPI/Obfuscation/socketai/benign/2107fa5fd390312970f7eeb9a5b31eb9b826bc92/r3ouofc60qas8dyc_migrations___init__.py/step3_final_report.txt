  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Code snippets, network activity indicators, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation patterns, code execution methods.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, data exfiltration points, dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets.",
  "flows": "Sources such as hardcoded IPs or eval() leading to data transmission or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation scores, dynamic code execution, hardcoded IPs/domains, empty or placeholder code, inconsistent risk scores for absent code.",
  "analysis": "Report 1 correctly identifies suspicious patterns including obfuscation and network activity, justifying high malware (0.6), obfuscation (0.7), and security risk (0.65) scores. Reports 2-5 describe benign or absent code, with low or zero scores, aligning with their descriptions. The only inconsistency is in Report 4, where a security risk of 0.2 is assigned despite no code being present; this should be lowered to 0 for accuracy. Overall, the scores are consistent with the analyses, with the exception of Report 4's risk score.",
  "conclusion": "The reports' scoring and reasoning are generally sound and aligned with their descriptions. The only adjustment needed is to set Report 4's security risk score from 0.2 to 0, reflecting the absence of code and malicious indicators. The high suspicion in Report 1 is justified by the described obfuscation and network activity. Benign reports correctly have zero or minimal scores.",
