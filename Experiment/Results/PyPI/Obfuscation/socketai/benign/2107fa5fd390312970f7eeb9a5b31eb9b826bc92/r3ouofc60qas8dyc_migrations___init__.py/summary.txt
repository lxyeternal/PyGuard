  "conclusion": "The reports' scoring and reasoning are generally sound and aligned with their descriptions. The only adjustment needed is to set Report 4's security risk score from 0.2 to 0, reflecting the absence of code and malicious indicators. The high suspicion in Report 1 is justified by the described obfuscation and network activity. Benign reports correctly have zero or minimal scores."
