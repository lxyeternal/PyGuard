{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package using setuptools, reads package metadata, and retrieves version information from the package's __init__.py file.",
  "sources": "The code reads files using codecs.open, including __init__.py and a specified filename, to extract version info and package descriptions.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; the setup parameters are static and do not process external input at runtime.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; all data used in setup is read from local files.",
  "anomalies": "The function 'jufhtNfXxiiJTBQVuRyXNVHvZrsYEree' uses regex to extract version info, which appears obfuscated but is not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code is present. Variable names are intentionally obscure but do not indicate malicious intent. The setup call uses static parameters; no dynamic or external input is processed during execution.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily functions as a setup script for a Python package. It reads the __init__.py file to extract version info and other metadata. The obfuscated variable names suggest possible code obfuscation but do not imply malicious activity. No code injection, network activity, credential theft, or backdoors are present. The package metadata is static and conforms to typical setup patterns. The code is minimal, focused on package configuration, and does not perform any runtime operations that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names but no malicious behavior or security risks. There are no signs of malware, data leaks, or supply chain attacks within this code fragment.",
