  "purpose": "This code appears to be a Python module intended for data processing or utility functions, with no explicit main functionality shown.",
  "sources": "Input is likely read from function parameters, environment variables, or external modules; no explicit input reading commands are visible.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file I/O, subprocess calls, or environment variable access, but none are explicitly present in the code.",
  "flows": "There are no clear source-to-sink data flows; the code mainly performs static computations or definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious function names, or unusual code constructs detected. The code structure appears normal.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises standard Python constructs such as function definitions, class declarations, and simple control flow. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious API usage is evident. All third-party library uses are benign, and no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are observed. There are no indications of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malware payloads. The code's purpose seems benign, with no evident security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no malicious behaviors, security risks, or obfuscation present. The code appears to be safe and standard in its implementation.",
