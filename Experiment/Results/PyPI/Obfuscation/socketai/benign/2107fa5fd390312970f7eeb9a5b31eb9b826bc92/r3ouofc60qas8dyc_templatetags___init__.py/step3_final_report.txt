  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Use of eval()/exec(), network connections, hardcoded URLs, environment variables, user input, indirect control flow, and obfuscated variables.",
  "sinks": "Potential data exfiltration points, network communication, system command execution, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Sources such as eval()/exec() and environment variables flow into dynamic code execution or data leaks; network connections may transmit data; obfuscated variables obscure control flow and data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation, dynamic code execution, hardcoded suspicious URLs, indirect control flow, reading untrusted sources, and suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are red flags for malicious intent. High scores in reports 2 and 3 are justified by eval()/exec() usage, network activity, and obfuscation. Report 1 and 4 are benign, with no suspicious patterns. Report 5 shows obfuscation and dynamic code but lacks confirmed malicious payloads. Slightly increasing malware scores for reports 3 and 5 from 0.5 to 0.6 and 0.4 to 0.5 respectively aligns with the suspicion level. Overall, the code's behavior warrants caution, with moderate to high security risk scores, but no definitive malicious payloads observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets analyzed show varying degrees of obfuscation and dynamic execution, indicating potential security concerns. Scores are generally appropriate; minor adjustments for reports 3 and 5 improve accuracy. Continuous monitoring and further analysis are recommended before deployment.",
