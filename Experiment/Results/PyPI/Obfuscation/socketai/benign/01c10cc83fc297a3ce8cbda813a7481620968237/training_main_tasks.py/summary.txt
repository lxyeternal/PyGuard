  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated NLP pipeline for Danish language tasks, with no current evidence of malicious activity. The high obfuscation warrants caution and further static or dynamic analysis before deployment in sensitive environments. Malware score is set to 0, consistent with the absence of malicious indicators. Obfuscation score is high due to nonsensical naming, and overall security risk is moderate owing to the difficulty in analysis but no active threats detected."
