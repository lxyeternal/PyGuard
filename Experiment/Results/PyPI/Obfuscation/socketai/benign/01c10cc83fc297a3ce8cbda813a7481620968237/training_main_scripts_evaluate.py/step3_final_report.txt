{
  "purpose": "The code performs evaluation of a coreference resolution model using spaCy, loading datasets, applying the model, and scoring outputs.",
  "sources": "Reads dataset files, model files, and configuration parameters; loads models and datasets from specified paths.",
  "sinks": "Writes evaluation scores to a JSON file; no network or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Loads model and datasets -> applies model to datasets -> computes scores -> writes scores to file.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with non-descriptive variable and function names; dynamic model loading from user-specified paths; complex nested functions; no comments or documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard NLP evaluation pipeline with obfuscated identifiers. It loads a spaCy model, datasets, performs coreference and span evaluation, and writes scores. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are detected. Obfuscation appears to be superficial, possibly for concealment or proprietary reasons. The dynamic model loading could be risky if models are malicious, but no evidence supports this. The code structure and behavior align with legitimate evaluation workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated NLP evaluation script with no signs of malicious activity or malware. Obfuscation is likely intended to conceal internal logic but does not indicate malicious intent. The security risk is low, and the malware score is 0.",
