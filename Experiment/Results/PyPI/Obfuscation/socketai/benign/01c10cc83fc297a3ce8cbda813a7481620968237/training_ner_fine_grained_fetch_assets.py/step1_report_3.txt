  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a specific function, but without seeing the actual code, it cannot be definitively identified.",
  "sources": "The code likely reads input data from function arguments, environment variables, or external files. Specific sources cannot be determined without the code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, file writing, system commands, or data processing functions. Precise sinks are unknown without the code.",
