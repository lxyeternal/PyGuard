  "conclusion": "The code snippet is suspicious mainly because of obfuscation and indirect invocation, but there is no direct evidence of malicious activity such as network requests, data theft, or system compromise. Further investigation should focus on the implementation of the function invoked by 'typer.run' and the context in which this code operates. The overall risk appears moderate, with low malware likelihood, but obfuscation warrants caution."
