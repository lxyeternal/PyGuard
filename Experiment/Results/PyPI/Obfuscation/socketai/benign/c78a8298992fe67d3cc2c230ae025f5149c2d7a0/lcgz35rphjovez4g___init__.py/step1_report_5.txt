{
  "purpose": "Defines a list of submodules or components for a Python package, likely for import/export purposes.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data sources are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sink functions or data leaks are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows or processing occurs; it's a simple declaration.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward with no suspicious or unusual elements.",
  "analysis": "The code only declares a list of module names assigned to __all__, which controls what is exported when the package is imported. There are no imports, no function definitions, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no external data handling. Its simplicity indicates standard practice for Python packaging or module organization.",
  "conclusion": "There is no malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risk in this code snippet. It appears to be a benign module declaration for controlling exports.",
