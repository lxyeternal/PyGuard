  "purpose": "Define an __all__ list for module exports, specifying public API components",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in the code",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points present in the code",
  "flows": "No data flow paths; only module export configuration",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code logic, data handling, or suspicious constructs; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple declaration of __all__, a list specifying which module attributes are public. It contains no executable logic, data input/output, or security-sensitive operations. It appears to be a standard Python module pattern without any anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module declaration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a typical practice in Python projects to control module exports.",
