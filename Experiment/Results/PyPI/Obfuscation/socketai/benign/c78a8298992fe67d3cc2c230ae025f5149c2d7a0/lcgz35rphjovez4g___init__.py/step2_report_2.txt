  "review": "Let's analyze these reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple declaration of the `__all__` list, which is a common Python pattern for defining public API exports.\n   - There are no signs of data input/output, dynamic code execution, or embedded logic.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are detected in any report.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly state that the code is benign, minimal, and standard.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign a confidence of 1 (or 1.0), which is appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n   - Malware scores are 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - Security risk scores are also 0, which is reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports agree on the benign nature and there is no evidence of malicious activity, the risk scores should remain at 0.\n   - Any higher score would be unjustified unless new suspicious elements are introduced.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The malware scores are all 0, which is correct.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain obfuscated code.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports are cautious and base their conclusions on the code's simplicity, with no assumptions about hidden malicious intent.\n   - They correctly identify the code as standard practice.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's content and the analysis provided.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**Overall Justification:**\nThe code is a straightforward module export declaration with no security issues, malicious intent, or obfuscation. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the current assessments and the code's benign nature.",
