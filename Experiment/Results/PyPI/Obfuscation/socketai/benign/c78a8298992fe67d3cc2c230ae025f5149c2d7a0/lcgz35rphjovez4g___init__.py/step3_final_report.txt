  "purpose": "Declaration of module exports via __all__ list.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of __all__ list; no external data input or output.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows or external effects.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or execution beyond static assignment.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static list assignment defining the public API of a module. No input/output, data processing, or executable logic is present. The code aligns with standard Python practices and shows no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning high confidence and zero malware/security risk scores. The code's simplicity and clarity justify a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module export declaration with no security issues, malware, or obfuscation. The assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
