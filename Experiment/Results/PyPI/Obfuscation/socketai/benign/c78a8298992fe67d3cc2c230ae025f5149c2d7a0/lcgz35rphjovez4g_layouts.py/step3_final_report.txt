  "purpose": "Complex graph layout and visualization, managing geometric positions, conflicts, and iterative optimization routines.",
  "sources": "Object attributes, method parameters, external modules (importlib, grandalf.utils), geometric calculations.",
  "sinks": "Internal geometric computations, view updates, conflict detection; no network, file, or system command activity observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows through geometric transformations, conflict resolution, recursive layout adjustments, and view modifications.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with meaningless class/variable names, dynamic import, complex recursive functions, recursion limit adjustments.",
  "analysis": "The code manages graph layers, vertices, conflicts, and geometric positions with complex control flow and obfuscation. No evidence of network activity, data exfiltration, or sabotage. Obfuscation appears stylistic or for code minimization rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated graph layout and visualization library with no active malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage detected. Obfuscation warrants caution but does not indicate malware.",
