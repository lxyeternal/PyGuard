  "purpose": "Geometric utility functions for spatial calculations such as line intersections, angle computations, vector normalization, and coordinate transformations.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as coordinate tuples, view objects, and optional numpy functions.",
  "sinks": "Internal mathematical operations; no external data flows, network activity, or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through geometric calculations and vector operations, with no external communication.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function and variable names, complex geometric logic, dynamic import fallback for numpy, use of SystemRandom for vector generation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs spatial and geometric computations, including line intersections, angle calculations, and vector normalization. Obfuscation appears stylistic or for code concealment, not malicious. No network, file, or system modification activities are present. The use of SystemRandom and fallback imports are benign. No hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate geometric utility library with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation seems intended for concealment or stylistic purposes rather than malicious intent.",
