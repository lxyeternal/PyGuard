  "purpose": "Implementation of a custom ordered set-like structure called Poset with set operations and comparisons.",
  "sources": "Input lists during initialization, method arguments, internal data structures (OrderedDict).",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data exfiltration points detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arguments into internal OrderedDict, with internal set operations and method calls.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names, use of deprecated 'cmp' function (Python 2), lack of comments or documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class that manages an ordered collection of unique elements, supporting standard set operations such as union, intersection, difference, and subset checks. The obfuscation and use of 'cmp' suggest legacy or intentionally obscured code, but no malicious actions such as network activity, file modifications, or data leaks are present. The static analysis indicates the code is a utility data structure with benign intent, with obfuscation being superficial and primarily affecting maintainability.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be an obfuscated implementation of an ordered set-like data structure with no signs of malicious behavior or active security risks. The high obfuscation score reflects naming and style choices, but the malware score remains at zero. Overall, the package is benign, with the main concern being maintainability due to obfuscation.",
