  "conclusion": "The code appears to be an obfuscated implementation of an ordered set-like data structure with no signs of malicious behavior or active security risks. The high obfuscation score reflects naming and style choices, but the malware score remains at zero. Overall, the package is benign, with the main concern being maintainability due to obfuscation."
