  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple import statements from local modules: poset, dot, and nx.\n- The majority highlight the use of 'import *' (wildcard imports), which is discouraged for clarity and maintainability but not inherently malicious.\n- None of the reports provide evidence of actual malicious activity, such as code execution, network access, or data exfiltration.\n- Malware scores are consistently 0 across all reports, indicating no malicious behavior detected.\n- Security risk scores are low (mostly 0 or 0.2), reflecting minimal concern based on this fragment.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Potential Issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code is straightforward, performing only relative imports. No issues with the presence or absence of malicious code.\n- **Malicious activity:** No evidence of malware or malicious intent is present.\n- **Use of 'import *':** While discouraged, this is common in some modules, especially for internal or experimental code. It does not imply maliciousness but could hide imported functions or classes, making static analysis harder.\n\n### Logical flaws or reasoning issues:\n- No logical flaws are evident in the reports. They correctly interpret the code as benign.\n- Some reports mention the potential for malicious code hiding within modules, but without evidence, this remains speculative.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- Security risk scores are low, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Scores should remain as is** since they reflect the analysis accurately.\n- The use of 'import *' should be flagged as a maintainability concern but not as a security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Based on the provided reports and analysis, I agree with the current scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** Very low (around 0.1 to 0.2)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, mainly due to 'import *' style, which is a maintainability concern but not a security issue)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
