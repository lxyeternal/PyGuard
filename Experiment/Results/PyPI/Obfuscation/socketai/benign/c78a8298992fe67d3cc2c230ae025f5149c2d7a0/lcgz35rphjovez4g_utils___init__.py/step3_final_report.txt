{
  "purpose": "The code performs relative imports from three local modules: poset, dot, and nx, likely to include their functionalities into the current module.",
  "sources": "Import statements from .poset, .dot, and .nx modules.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data flows are present; the code only imports modules.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows exist; the code only executes import statements.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' from local modules, which can obscure imported content and affect maintainability but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of relative import statements with wildcard syntax. No executable logic, data processing, or external interactions are present. The use of 'import *' is discouraged for clarity but does not introduce security risks. No signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, network activity, or data exfiltration, are evident. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1-0.2), primarily due to maintainability concerns. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and transparency of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting only of internal module imports. There is no malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The main concern is maintainability due to the use of wildcard imports, but this does not constitute a security threat.",
