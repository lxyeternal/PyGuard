  "purpose": "Importing modules related to posets, dot graphs, and networkx functionalities.",
  "sources": "Import statements that include all symbols from local modules poset, dot, and nx.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks, as the code only performs imports.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only module imports.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports ('*') can be considered suspicious as it can obscure the imported content, potentially hiding malicious code or unintended functions.",
  "analysis": "The code performs simple import statements from local modules, importing all symbols via wildcard. Wildcard imports are discouraged as they can lead to namespace pollution and obscure code origin. Since these are local modules, their content is unknown, but the act of importing itself is benign unless malicious code resides within these modules. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network access, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. The code is minimal and does not include any suspicious or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code only performs wildcard imports from local modules, which by itself does not indicate malicious intent. The use of wildcard imports can be risky or discouraged, but it does not suggest malware or security risks directly. No malicious behavior detected based solely on these import statements.",
