  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple import statements from local modules: `.poset`, `.dot`, and `.nx`.\n- The majority agree that there is no malicious activity, data leaks, or suspicious behavior in these snippets.\n- Several reports mention the use of 'import *' (wildcard imports), which is discouraged for maintainability but not inherently malicious.\n- The reports assign malware scores of 0, and security risks are very low or zero.\n- Confidence levels are generally high (mostly 1), except for reports noting the potential concern with wildcard imports, which have lower confidence.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present in the code?**  \n  Yes, all reports correctly identify that the code only contains import statements. No actual malicious code or data flow is present.\n\n- **Are there errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic?**  \n  No significant errors are apparent. The reports correctly identify that these are benign import statements, with some noting the use of wildcard imports as a potential maintainability concern but not malicious.\n\n- **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n  The malware scores are consistently 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code. Security risk scores are very low, reflecting minimal concern.\n\n- **Risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n  None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.2, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n\n- **Malware score justification:**  \n  Since the code only imports modules and shows no signs of malicious behavior, a malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n  No reports make unwarranted assumptions; they appropriately interpret the import statements as benign.\n\n- **Consistency of scores:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the analysis, with no discrepancies.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n- The main point of concern is the use of `import *`. While discouraged, it is common in internal modules and does not indicate malicious intent. The reports correctly flag this as a maintainability concern but not a security issue.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should be 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** Given the benign nature, should be close to 0, perhaps 0.1 at most, mainly due to the wildcard import concern.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (due to wildcard imports)  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, with no malicious intent or security issues. The main concern is maintainability due to wildcard imports, but this does not elevate the security risk significantly.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate in their assessments. The scores are appropriate, and no changes are necessary. The code fragment is safe, with only minor maintainability concerns.",
