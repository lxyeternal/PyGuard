  "purpose": "The code imports modules related to poset, dot, and networkx functionalities, likely for graph or data structure manipulation.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing modules from the same package or directory",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present in these import statements",
  "flows": "No data flow present; just module imports",
  "anomalies": "The code only contains import statements with no additional logic or data handling; no anomalies detected in these statements",
  "analysis": "The code is composed solely of import statements from local modules, indicating a modular structure. There are no hardcoded secrets, no execution of dynamic code, and no suspicious network or file operations. The simplicity suggests standard import behavior, and nothing indicates malicious intent or unusual behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting only of import statements for internal modules. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this fragment.",
