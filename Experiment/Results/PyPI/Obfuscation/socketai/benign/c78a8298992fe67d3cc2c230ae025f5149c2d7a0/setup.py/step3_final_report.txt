{
  "purpose": "The code defines package metadata for 'Grandalf', a graph drawing library, with no dynamic or malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Static strings and import statements (though the import is invalid), used to provide package info.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or potential data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; invalid import statement (`from setuptools import HkLcVTehFkNnurQpReJCfHSYjzuvtyiM`).",
  "analysis": "The code is a static setup configuration with obfuscated variable names and an invalid import, possibly obfuscation or typo. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or malicious payloads are present. The obfuscation does not inherently imply malicious intent but warrants cautious review. The invalid import is likely a typo or obfuscation attempt, not malicious. Overall, the code is benign, serving as a package metadata descriptor with some obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with obfuscated variable names and an invalid import statement. No evidence of malicious behavior or security risks is found. The obfuscation warrants cautious review but does not indicate malicious intent.",
