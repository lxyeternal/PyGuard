  "sources": "Class definition and class attribute assignment",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink as there are no dynamic operations",
  "anomalies": "Class name is a nonsensical, obfuscated name; attribute value is a seemingly random string, but these are not inherently malicious",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of ValueError with a non-descriptive class name and a class attribute containing a random string. There are no input sources, no data processing, and no external or untrusted data handling. The class appears to be a placeholder or obfuscated name, with no apparent malicious logic or behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It is a simple class definition with no active operations or data leaks.",
