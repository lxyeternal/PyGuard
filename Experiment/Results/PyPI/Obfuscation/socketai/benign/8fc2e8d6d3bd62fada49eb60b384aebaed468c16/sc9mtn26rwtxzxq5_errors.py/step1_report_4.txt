  "purpose": "Custom exception class definition with a class attribute.",
  "sources": "Class declaration and class attribute assignment.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; class attribute is static.",
  "anomalies": "Class name appears randomly generated; attribute name is obfuscated; no meaningful logic or data handling; no dynamic code execution, input/output, or external connections.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class inheriting from ValueError, with an attribute assigned a seemingly random string. The class name and attribute do not indicate any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. There are no sources of untrusted input, no sinks where data could leak or be exploited, and no data flows that could lead to security issues. The code appears to be a placeholder or obfuscated naming, but functionally it does not perform any harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It is a simple custom exception class with obfuscated naming, likely auto-generated or placeholder code. No malicious intent or security threats are evident.",
