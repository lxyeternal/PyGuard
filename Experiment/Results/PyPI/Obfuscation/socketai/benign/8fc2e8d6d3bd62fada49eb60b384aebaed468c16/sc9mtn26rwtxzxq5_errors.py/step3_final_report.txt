  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class inheriting from ValueError with a static string attribute.",
  "sources": "Class declaration and static attribute assignment",
  "sinks": "No data input/output, no external communication or data flow",
  "flows": "None; static class attribute with no dynamic data flow",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class name and attribute, no methods or behavior, likely placeholder or obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward class inheriting from a standard exception with a static string attribute. No functions, data processing, or external interactions are present. The obfuscated naming suggests placeholder or stylistic obfuscation but does not indicate malicious intent. No signs of network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code. The high obfuscation score is justified but does not imply malicious behavior. The code's benign nature is confirmed by the absence of dynamic or operational logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as an obfuscated placeholder or stylistic class definition with no malicious or security-threatening behavior. The high obfuscation score warrants attention but does not indicate malicious intent. The overall security risk is minimal.",
