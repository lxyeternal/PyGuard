  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class with a class attribute.",
  "sources": "Class definition and class attribute assignment.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or external output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; class attribute is static.",
  "anomalies": "The class name and attribute name appear obfuscated and nonsensical; no actual functionality or logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of ValueError with a cryptic name, containing a single class attribute assigned a string value. There are no functions, input/output operations, or external data handling. The code does not perform any operations, and the class appears to be a placeholder or obfuscated with no clear purpose. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors are evident. The obfuscated naming could suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent, but on its own, it is benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple class definition with obfuscated names, lacking any operational or malicious elements. It does not appear to be malicious or contain malware. The primary concern is the obfuscated naming, which could be intended to hide purpose, but without further context, it is benign.",
