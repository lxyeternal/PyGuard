  "conclusion": "The code appears to be an obfuscated utility wrapper with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The high obfuscation score reflects deliberate obscurity, but the malware score remains zero due to lack of malicious indicators. Overall security risk is low, but caution is advised if used in a broader supply chain context."
