{
  "purpose": "This class appears to be a singleton pattern implementation with dynamic attribute setting based on input data, likely for managing shared configuration or data storage.",
  "sources": "Input data via **KRqvBjnGpBwGgjopYHbBFqTKkvtWyHZQ in __init__ and __new__, where data is provided as key-value pairs.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly identified; no data is transmitted externally, stored insecurely, or used in insecure operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input (kwargs) into attribute assignment in __init__, and the singleton instance is retrieved or created in __new__.",
  "anomalies": "Use of setattr on the class object itself can modify class attributes at runtime, which is unusual but not inherently malicious; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code detected. The singleton pattern is implemented in a standard way. No obfuscated code or malicious behaviors apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with class variables and an __init__ method that dynamically assigns attributes based on provided key-value pairs. The __new__ method enforces a singleton pattern, ensuring only one instance exists. No external data transmission, no code injection, and no suspicious behavior are observed. The code appears to be a standard, somewhat obfuscated singleton pattern with dynamic attributes, which could be misused if not properly controlled, but on its own, it does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It implements a singleton pattern with dynamic attribute assignment, which is not inherently harmful. No malicious signals or security issues detected based on this snippet.",
