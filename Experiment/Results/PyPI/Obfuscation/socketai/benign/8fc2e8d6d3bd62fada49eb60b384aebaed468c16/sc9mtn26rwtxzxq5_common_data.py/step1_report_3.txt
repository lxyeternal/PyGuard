  "purpose": "Define a singleton class that dynamically sets class attributes based on input key-value pairs during initialization.",
  "sources": "Input data via **KRqvBjnGpBwGgjopYHbBFqTKkvtWyHZQ in __init__ and __new__ methods.",
  "sinks": "Setting class attributes dynamically; no external untrusted data sinks or network actions observed.",
  "flows": "Input data (KRqvBjnGpBwGgjopYHbBFqTKkvtWyHZQ) flows into setattr() within __init__ to assign class attributes; __new__ controls singleton instantiation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of setattr on self.__class__ to assign class variables dynamically is unusual but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The class is a singleton pattern implementation with dynamic attribute assignment during instantiation. The dynamic setting of class attributes via setattr on the class itself could be used to modify class behavior at runtime, but no malicious behavior (like data exfiltration, network activity, or obfuscation) is evident. The code lacks external resource access or malicious payloads. It appears to be a legitimate singleton design with dynamic attributes.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a singleton pattern with dynamic attribute setting; no malicious behavior or suspicious activity is detected. It seems to be a controlled design pattern implementation without malicious intent.",
