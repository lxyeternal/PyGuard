  "conclusion": "The provided import statements with obfuscated names do not provide evidence of malicious activity but warrant further review of the broader codebase. The high obfuscation score is justified, but the malware score remains low given the current evidence. No active malicious behavior is demonstrated in this snippet, but continued scrutiny is recommended when analyzing the full package."
