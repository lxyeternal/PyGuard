  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard CLI setup with heavy obfuscation and dynamic invocation, which could be used to conceal malicious behavior. However, in the absence of evidence such as network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications, there is no confirmed malicious activity. The main concern is the obfuscation and reliance on external modules, which should be reviewed further. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is high (~0.75), and overall security risk is low (~0.2). Further investigation into the external modules and runtime behavior is recommended before making definitive security judgments."
