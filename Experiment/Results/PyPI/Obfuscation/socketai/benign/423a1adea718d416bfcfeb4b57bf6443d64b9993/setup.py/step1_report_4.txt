{
  "purpose": "This script sets up a Python package using setuptools, reading metadata from files and defining dependencies, entry points, and package information.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description, 'VERSION' file for version number, and package data files.",
  "sinks": "None of the code involves untrusted data execution or data sinks; it is a standard setup script.",
  "flows": "Reads files -> supplies metadata and configuration to setup() -> package installation process.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names (e.g., CyhojDXcKUfDVmPjRgfkqBGrPoubikmc, cZBlIoONNSlNbiTujQrpeQzFICobHfKt) are unusual but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are present. No dynamic code execution or unsafe operations detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with obfuscated variable names but no malicious patterns. It reads package description and version info from files, then calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. There are no apparent malicious behaviors such as network access, code injection, or data exfiltration. The obfuscation appears to be an attempt to hide variable names, not malicious intent. No suspicious code constructs, no hardcoded secrets, and no external code execution pathways are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard package setup configuration with obfuscated variable names but no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be legitimate code used for packaging a Python project.",
