  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package, defining metadata, dependencies, entry points, and data files.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' and 'VERSION' files; static strings in the setup() function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or external calls from this code.",
  "flows": "Reads from files 'README.md' and 'VERSION' as sources, but no data flows into potentially dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names that do not follow standard naming conventions, which could be suspicious. No other anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or malicious code found.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup operations using setuptools, reading metadata files, and configuring package dependencies, metadata, entry points, and data files. Variable names are intentionally obscure, which could be an attempt at obfuscation, but no malicious behavior or security risks are evident. No untrusted data processing, external network access, or suspicious code is present. The setup script appears typical for a Python package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a conventional setup configuration for a Python package with obfuscated variable names. No malicious or maliciously intented code is detected. The code is primarily standard package setup with no security concerns.",
