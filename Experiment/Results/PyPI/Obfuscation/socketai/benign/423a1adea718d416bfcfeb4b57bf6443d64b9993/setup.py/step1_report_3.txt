{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package, used to specify package metadata, dependencies, and entry points for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads content from 'README.md' and 'VERSION' files; no untrusted input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "Uses setup() function to define package metadata and dependencies; no direct untrusted data handling or system effects.",
  "flows": "Reads files and passes static data to setup(); no dynamic or untrusted data flows to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names that appear randomly generated; no malicious code or backdoors evident. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script loads content from files with unconventional variable names, then calls setup() with static, well-formed arguments to configure package distribution. No indication of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The obfuscation appears to be a naming pattern rather than an attempt to hide malicious code. Dependencies are typical for a Python web application. No anomalies or suspicious code features detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with obfuscated variable names. It does not contain malicious code or supply chain threats. No security issues are identified.",
