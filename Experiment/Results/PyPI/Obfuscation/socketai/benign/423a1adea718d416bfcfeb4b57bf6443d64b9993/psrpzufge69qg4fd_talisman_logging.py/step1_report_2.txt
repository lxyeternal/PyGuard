  "purpose": "Configure and set up logging with customizable log levels and a JSON formatter",
  "sources": "import statements, function definitions, and argument parsing setup",
  "sinks": "logging configuration and formatter setup, which could affect output format but not directly vulnerable sinks",
  "flows": "configuration functions invoke formatter setup, logging handlers, and level setting based on user input",
  "anomalies": "Use of lambda that returns 'NON-SERIALIZABLE' could be unusual but is not inherently malicious; no hardcoded credentials or external network access observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to create a JSON formatter and configure logging. The formatter uses a custom date format and a lambda that returns a static string, which is unusual but not malicious. The logging setup attaches a stream handler with the JSON formatter. Argument parsing allows dynamic setting of log levels with choices mapped from a dictionary. There are no evident sources or sinks related to untrusted data, nor any network activity, file manipulations, or data leaks. The code appears solely to configure logging behavior with customizable levels and output format.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard logging setup with an unusual lambda function but no malicious intent or security risks evident. It does not perform any malicious actions, data exfiltration, or sabotage. It appears safe but could be reviewed for potential misconfiguration in a broader context.",
