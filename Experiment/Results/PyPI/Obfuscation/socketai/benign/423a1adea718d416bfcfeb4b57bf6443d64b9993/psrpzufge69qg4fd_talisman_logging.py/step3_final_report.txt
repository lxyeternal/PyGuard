  "purpose": "Configure logging with a JSON formatter and dynamic log level based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "Input from command-line arguments (--logging_level), internal function calls for formatter setup.",
  "sinks": "Logging output to standard output via StreamHandler.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument parsing -> setting log level -> configuring StreamHandler -> logging setup.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function and variable names; lambda returning static string 'NON-SERIALIZABLE'; no external data or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a logging configuration with obfuscated identifiers and a JSON formatter that includes a lambda returning a static string. No network, data exfiltration, or malicious code is present. The obfuscation appears to be for concealment but does not demonstrate malicious intent. The lambda's static return value is unusual but benign. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0.7, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's characteristics, which show obfuscation but no active threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign logging setup with obfuscation tactics that do not indicate malicious behavior or supply chain threats. The high obfuscation score is justified, and malware risk remains at zero. Overall, the code does not pose a security threat based on the provided analysis.",
