  "purpose": "Configure logging with customizable levels and a JSON formatter",
  "sources": "Import statements, function definitions, argument parser, and logger configuration",
  "sinks": "None detected that handle untrusted input directly; configuration functions only set up logging",
  "flows": "Input from command-line arguments influences logging level, which then configures the logger",
  "anomalies": "Function names are obfuscated, with non-descriptive names; the JSON formatter's lambda returns a non-serializable placeholder; no apparent malicious code execution or network activity; code appears to focus on logging setup.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a JSON formatter and logging configuration functions. It obfuscates function names, likely to evade straightforward code analysis. The JSON formatter uses a lambda that returns 'NON-SERIALIZABLE', which suggests an intent to prevent serialization but isn't malicious per se. No suspicious network connections, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is evident. No hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads are present. The obfuscation of function names and placeholder lambda may be suspicious for evasion, but within a supply chain security context, it does not directly indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily configures logging with an obfuscated style and does not exhibit malicious behavior or supply chain threats. The obfuscation appears to be for evasion or aesthetic reasons rather than malicious intent.",
