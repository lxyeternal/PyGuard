  "confidence": 0.8,
  "conclusion": "Based on the detailed descriptions, the code in reports 1 and 3 shows strong indicators of malicious behavior, warranting high malware and security risk scores. Reports 4 and 5 are benign, with low scores. Report 2 presents moderate suspicion. Adjusting malware scores for reports 1-3 to around 0.5–0.8 aligns with the suspicion levels, considering the lack of direct code evidence. The overall assessment suggests cautious handling of suspicious dependencies, with further code inspection recommended before deployment."
