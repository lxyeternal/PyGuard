  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for data processing or utility functions, but the specific purpose cannot be conclusively determined from the provided snippet.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function arguments or possibly environment variables; no explicit input sources are visible.",
  "sinks": "Data may be outputted through return statements, file writing, or network calls, but no direct sinks are evident in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions toward outputs, but specific paths are unclear due to limited code context.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious function calls, or unusual code constructs are evident; code structure appears normal. Absence of obfuscation, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious variable naming.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet lacks apparent malicious indicators. It contains standard programming constructs without obfuscated or suspicious features. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behavior are observable. The code's intent appears benign, focusing on data processing or utility functions. Given the limited context, no malicious activity or security vulnerabilities can be definitively identified.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears standard and benign, with no signs of sabotage or malware. Confidence is high that this code is safe within the scope of this review.",
