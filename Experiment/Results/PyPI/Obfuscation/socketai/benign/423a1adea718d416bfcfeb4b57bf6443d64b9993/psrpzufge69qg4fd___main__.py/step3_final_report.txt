{
  "purpose": "Importing and executing an obfuscated function from a local module 'talisman', likely for initialization or concealed behavior.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .talisman module, the function tDsJyOIcmdGzvctpYUhhtGadaKJLsjUQ",
  "sinks": "Function invocation that could execute code, perform network activity, or manipulate system state",
  "flows": "Import from .talisman -> immediate call to tDsJyOIcmdGzvctpYUhhtGadaKJLsjUQ()",
  "anomalies": "Use of a highly obfuscated function name, immediate invocation without context, no parameters or comments",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function with an obfuscated name from a local module and immediately executes it. The pattern of obfuscation combined with immediate invocation is suspicious and common in malicious scripts to hide harmful behavior. Without inspecting the 'talisman' module, we cannot confirm malicious intent, but the obfuscation and pattern warrant caution. The suspicion level is moderate to high, but no definitive malicious activity can be confirmed solely from this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code pattern is suspicious due to obfuscation and immediate invocation, indicating potential malicious intent. However, without further inspection of the 'talisman' module, this remains speculative. The scores should reflect moderate suspicion, with high obfuscation and moderate malware likelihood.",
