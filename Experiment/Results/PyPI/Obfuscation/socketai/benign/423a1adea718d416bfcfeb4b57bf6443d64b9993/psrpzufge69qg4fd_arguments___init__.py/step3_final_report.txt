  "purpose": "Assess the supply chain security and malicious potential of the open source dependency based on provided code analysis reports.",
  "sources": "Not applicable; no code snippets provided in the reports.",
  "sinks": "Not applicable; no untrusted data flows identified due to absence of code.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no source-to-sink data flows can be analyzed without code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; all reports indicate either no code or benign code with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly note the absence of code or lack of suspicious activity. The scores assigned—malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2—are consistent with the descriptions. High confidence scores align with the benign assessments. No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or high security risk is present. The evaluations are conservative and appropriate given the limited information. If actual code snippets reveal dynamic execution or obfuscation, scores should be revisited upward.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency appears benign with no detected malicious activity or obfuscation. The current low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the low security risk score reflects minimal concern. Unless new code evidence indicates otherwise, the dependency is considered safe.",
