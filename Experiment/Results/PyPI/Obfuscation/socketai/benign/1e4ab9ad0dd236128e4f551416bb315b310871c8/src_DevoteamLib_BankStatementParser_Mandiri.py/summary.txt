  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated data parser with debugging artifacts, lacking evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is correctly set to 0. The obfuscation level justifies a higher obfuscated score (~0.7). The overall security risk remains low (~0.2). The main concern is code maintainability and correctness, not security."
