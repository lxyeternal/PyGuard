      "conclusion": "The code is a typical, obfuscated user authentication module with no evidence of malicious activity or malware. The primary security issues relate to insecure file handling and password management practices, not malicious intent. The supply chain risk is low, but security hygiene should be improved to mitigate potential vulnerabilities."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate document processing pipeline with AI integration. While obfuscation and complex control flow raise red flags, there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. The malware score is low (0.1), obfuscation is moderate (0.65), and overall risk is low to moderate (0.3). Continuous monitoring and further validation are recommended, but current analysis suggests the code is primarily for legitimate processing tasks."

      "conclusion": "The code is a complex, potentially obfuscated bank statement parser utilizing OCR and regex. There is no evidence of malicious activity or malware. The obfuscation and regex complexity warrant cautious deployment, but overall, it appears legitimate. The overall security risk is moderate, and malware likelihood is very low."

There is no evidence of malware, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. The high obfuscation score reflects variable naming but does not imply malicious intent. The low risk score indicates minimal security concern, primarily due to the bug which should be fixed for proper functionality."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is a data parsing utility with heavy obfuscation and a likely incomplete or intentionally obscured implementation due to the undefined 'tanggal'. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware is absent. The security risk is low but warrants caution due to potential runtime errors and obfuscation hiding intent."

      "confidence": 0.85,
      "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated data parser with debugging artifacts, lacking evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is correctly set to 0. The obfuscation level justifies a higher obfuscated score (~0.7). The overall security risk remains low (~0.2). The main concern is code maintainability and correctness, not security."

The high obfuscation and debug statements suggest concealment but do not imply malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
