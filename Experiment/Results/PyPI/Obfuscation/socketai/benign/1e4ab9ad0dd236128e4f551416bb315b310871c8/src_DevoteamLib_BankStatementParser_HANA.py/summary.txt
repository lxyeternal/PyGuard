  "conclusion": "The code is a data parsing utility with heavy obfuscation and a likely incomplete or intentionally obscured implementation due to the undefined 'tanggal'. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware is absent. The security risk is low but warrants caution due to potential runtime errors and obfuscation hiding intent."
