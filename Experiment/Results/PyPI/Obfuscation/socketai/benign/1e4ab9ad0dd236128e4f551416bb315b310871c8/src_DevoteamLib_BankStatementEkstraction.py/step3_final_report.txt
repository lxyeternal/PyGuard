{
  "purpose": "The code is designed for extracting and processing bank statement data from PDFs/images using OCR, regex parsing, and external libraries, primarily for financial data analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads PDF/image files, environment variables, and regex patterns; utilizes external libraries for OCR and parsing.",
  "sinks": "No network connections or system modifications; data flows from PDF conversion to OCR to regex extraction and data structuring.",
  "flows": "PDF/image input -> OCR processing -> regex extraction -> data manipulation and structuring -> output data structures.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy use of complex regex, dynamic variable names, obfuscated patterns, and external permission checks; debug print statements present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs document conversion, OCR, and regex-based data extraction for bank statements. It uses obfuscated variable names and complex regex tailored for specific banks, which could be used to hide malicious intent but currently serve data parsing purposes. No network activity, system modifications, or data exfiltration are evident. The obfuscation level is moderate, and the code handles sensitive financial data, warranting cautious review. The functions include environment permission checks, regex pattern matching, and data structuring, all consistent with legitimate document processing. No signs of malicious behavior such as backdoors, data theft, or system damage are present. The complex regex and obfuscation increase the potential for misuse, but without concrete malicious actions, the code appears primarily as a sophisticated parser.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a complex, potentially obfuscated bank statement parser utilizing OCR and regex. There is no evidence of malicious activity or malware. The obfuscation and regex complexity warrant cautious deployment, but overall, it appears legitimate. The overall security risk is moderate, and malware likelihood is very low.",
