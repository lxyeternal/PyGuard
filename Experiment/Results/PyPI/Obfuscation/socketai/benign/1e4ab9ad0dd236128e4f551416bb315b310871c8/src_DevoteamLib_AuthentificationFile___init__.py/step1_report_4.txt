{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated due to lack of comments or documentation; it appears to be a module that performs some data processing or utility functions, but the specific intent cannot be determined definitively from the code provided.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables and possibly from function parameters or local variables; no external input sources are evident beyond environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file operations, or data output functions, but the code does not explicitly contain such sinks. No suspicious network or file activity is apparent.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or function inputs through various processing functions; without explicit network or system calls, there are no clear untrusted data flows to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs are detected. The code contains standard Python syntax, with no obfuscated or unusual language features. No malicious or unusual behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "A careful review of the entire code shows standard Python functions and variables with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The code does not include any network connections, system modifications, or data exfiltration methods. Usage of environment variables is typical and does not indicate malicious activity. There are no unusual patterns or anomalies present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign, with no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain sabotage, or security risks. It is a standard Python module performing typical functions without any suspicious or harmful code segments.",
