{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple utility for performing basic arithmetic operations, likely for educational or utility purposes.",
  "sources": "Input from user via 'input()' function calls, reading data from standard input or predefined variables.",
  "sinks": "Print statements outputting results, potential use of eval() which could execute arbitrary code if input is malicious.",
  "flows": "User input is taken, then processed via arithmetic operations, and results are printed. If eval() is used on untrusted input, it could lead to code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval() on untrusted input, which is a known security risk. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code detected. The code is straightforward but risky if user input is not sanitized.",
  "analysis": "The code's core functionality involves receiving input and performing calculations. The critical point is whether eval() or similar functions are used on untrusted input; if so, it can lead to remote code execution. No other malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors is observed. The structure is simple, and the purpose appears benign, but the use of eval() introduces significant security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs basic operations but uses eval() unsafely on user input, which can lead to remote code execution if exploited. The overall security risk is high due to this unsafe pattern.",
