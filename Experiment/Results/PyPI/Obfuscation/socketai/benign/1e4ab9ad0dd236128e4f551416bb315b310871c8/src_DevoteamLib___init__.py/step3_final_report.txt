  "purpose": "User authentication and permission control via YAML files, verifying passwords with SHA-256 hashes.",
  "sources": "Reading YAML files named after usernames from the 'AuthentificationFile' directory.",
  "sinks": "Global variables set from YAML data; no external network or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Loading user YAML file -> verifying password hash -> setting global permission variables.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names; use of password+username concatenation for hashing; potential lack of input sanitization leading to path traversal risk.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward user authentication using YAML files, with obfuscated identifiers that hinder analysis but do not imply malicious intent. No network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection is present. The use of concatenated password+username for hashing is unconventional but not inherently insecure. Potential security concerns include path traversal due to dynamic filename construction without validation, insecure credential storage, and broad exception handling. No signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or external communication are detected. The obfuscation and insecure practices pose security risks but do not constitute malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, obfuscated user authentication module with no evidence of malicious activity or malware. The primary security issues relate to insecure file handling and password management practices, not malicious intent. The supply chain risk is low, but security hygiene should be improved to mitigate potential vulnerabilities.",
