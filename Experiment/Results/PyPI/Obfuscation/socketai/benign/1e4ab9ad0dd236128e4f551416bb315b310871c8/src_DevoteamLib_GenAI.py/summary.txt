  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate document processing pipeline with AI integration. While obfuscation and complex control flow raise red flags, there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. The malware score is low (0.1), obfuscation is moderate (0.65), and overall risk is low to moderate (0.3). Continuous monitoring and further validation are recommended, but current analysis suggests the code is primarily for legitimate processing tasks."
