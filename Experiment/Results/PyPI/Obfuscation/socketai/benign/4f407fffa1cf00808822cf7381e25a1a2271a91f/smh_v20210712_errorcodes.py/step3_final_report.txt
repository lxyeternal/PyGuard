  "purpose": "This code snippet contains only a UTF-8 encoding declaration, serving as a minimal file header or placeholder.",
  "sources": "No data sources; the code does not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data flows or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the snippet is purely declarative with no executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a simple encoding declaration with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, non-executable declaration specifying UTF-8 encoding. It contains no input handling, data processing, or network activity. The reports correctly identify the snippet as benign, with high confidence, and assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The simplicity and lack of executable content justify the low risk assessment and scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is a benign, minimal encoding declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or adjustment is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
