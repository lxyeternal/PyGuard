      "conclusion": "The code appears benign across most reports, with some obfuscation and dynamic features in Report 3. Adjusting the malware score downward in Report 3 enhances accuracy, aligning suspicion with evidence. Overall, the supply chain risk remains low, and the code is unlikely malicious based on current analysis."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a set of standard, auto-generated SDK data models with no malicious intent or supply chain security issues. The high verbosity and duplicated comments are typical of auto-generated code, not malicious obfuscation. Handling of sensitive data attributes should be managed securely outside this code, but the code itself is safe. Malware and malicious activity are not present."
