  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Potentially unsafe functions (eval/exec), external URL calls, environment variables, user input.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file system, environment variables, data output.",
  "flows": "Sources such as eval/exec or network calls leading to data exfiltration, code execution, or system compromise.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval/exec, obfuscation, external URL access, incomplete or empty code, hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code review indicates that most reports correctly identify benign or suspicious features. Report 2's suspicion of eval/exec and external communication justifies higher malware and obfuscation scores, assuming these features are confirmed. Other reports show no malicious patterns, with scores aligned to their benign assessments. The scores are consistent with the described behaviors, with the exception of Report 2, which warrants careful verification of its features.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with low security risk; Report 2 shows moderate suspicion justified by dynamic execution and external communication. The scoring system aligns with the analysis, and no adjustments are necessary unless further code evidence suggests otherwise.",
