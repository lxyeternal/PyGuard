  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a specific task based on the imported modules and function definitions. Without additional context, it seems to be a utility or processing script.",
  "sources": "Data is read from environment variables, user input, or external files (not explicitly shown in the snippet). No specific source is identified in the provided code fragment.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or system commands if present later in the code (not visible in this fragment). No explicit sink is identified in the current code snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or inputs to sinks like files or network endpoints through processing functions, but no explicit flow is observed in this fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious URL connections, or malicious code constructs are evident. The code does not contain obfuscated elements or uncommon language features. No backdoors or hidden behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard imports and straightforward functions, likely for data processing. It does not show signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. Without additional context or hidden code, the code appears benign. The lack of explicit sources, sinks, or suspicious constructs suggests a normal, non-malicious utility script.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears to be a benign component of a larger project, with no evidence of malware or security threats.",
