{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform a simple data processing or utility function, but the specific purpose cannot be definitively determined due to lack of context.",
  "sources": "Input from environment variables, function parameters, or standard input streams.",
  "sinks": "Potential data outputs include writing to files, network sockets, or printing to console; specific sinks are not explicitly shown.",
  "flows": "Data is read from sources (e.g., environment variables or input), processed, and then sent to sinks such as output functions or network calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. No unusual dynamic code execution or misleading variable names are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code's structure suggests typical data handling with standard Python functions. No suspicious patterns, malicious payloads, or security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection or unsafe eval are observed. Usage of third-party libraries appears legitimate. Lack of explicit network activity or sensitive data handling reduces concerns. However, without full context or external code dependencies, the review cannot guarantee safety entirely.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems benign with no suspicious anomalies or malware indicators. Nonetheless, confidence is moderate due to incomplete context.",
