  "malware_score": 0.1,
  "security_risk": 0.2,

  "conclusion": "The code appears benign across most reports, with some obfuscation and dynamic features in Report 3. Adjusting the malware score downward in Report 3 enhances accuracy, aligning suspicion with evidence. Overall, the supply chain risk remains low, and the code is unlikely malicious based on current analysis."
