  "purpose": "Evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Code snippets, variable names, dynamic execution points, network or file I/O, input handling.",
  "sinks": "Potential data exfiltration points, dynamic code execution functions (eval, exec), network connections, file modifications.",
  "flows": "Input sources (user input, environment variables) to sinks (eval, network calls, file writes) via code execution paths.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, use of eval/exec, high obfuscation scores, dynamic code execution, inconsistent malware scoring relative to suspicion.",
  "analysis": "Most reports correctly identify benign code with low malware and obfuscation scores. Report 3 notes obfuscation and dynamic execution, raising suspicion but no confirmed malicious activity. Scores are generally consistent; however, the malware score in Report 3 should be slightly lowered from 0.2 to 0.1 to better reflect the lack of concrete malicious payloads. Obfuscation score in Report 3 remains appropriate at 0.7. Overall, the assessments are cautious but justified, with minor adjustments recommended for accuracy.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign across most reports, with some obfuscation and dynamic features in Report 3. Adjusting the malware score downward in Report 3 enhances accuracy, aligning suspicion with evidence. Overall, the supply chain risk remains low, and the code is unlikely malicious based on current analysis.",
