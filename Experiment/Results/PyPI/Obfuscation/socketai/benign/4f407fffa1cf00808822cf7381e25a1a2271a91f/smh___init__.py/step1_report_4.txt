  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated; it appears to perform some form of data processing or utility functions, possibly related to package setup or utility scripts.",
  "sources": "Reads input from environment variables, configuration files, or user input; potentially from network sockets or API calls if present in the full code.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes data to files, network connections, or logs; uses system commands or subprocesses that could execute untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or user input through various processing functions, potentially reaching sinks like network sockets or system commands.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets observed; no obfuscated code, suspicious network activity, or hidden backdoors evident in the visible code. No unusual language features or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of standard Python functions and possibly setup routines. No suspicious network calls, credential harvesting, or backdoor mechanisms are observed. Use of third-party libraries appears typical. Without further context, there are no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. The code structure and variable naming are straightforward, with no obfuscation or hidden logic.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code appears to be benign and aligns with typical utility or setup scripts. Confidence is high that this code is safe given the current analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
