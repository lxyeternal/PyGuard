{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define parameters and types for various request and response models related to a cloud service SDK, specifically for Tencent Cloud's SMH service.",
  "sources": "No explicit data sources; it primarily documents function parameters and data models.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or execute untrusted data directly.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code is a set of parameter annotations and documentation, not executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only comments and parameter type annotations without executable or malicious code segments.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of parameter docstrings and type annotations for SDK models, not implementing any logic or data handling. No input sources, data processing, or data sinks are present. No anomalies, suspicious behaviors, or malicious constructs are identifiable. The code structure indicates a typical SDK parameter documentation pattern, with no embedded or obfuscated code. There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior. Overall, the code is benign and appears to be part of a larger SDK framework.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard documentation snippet for request and response models in a cloud SDK. It does not contain executable logic or any malicious content. Therefore, it poses no security risks and can be considered safe.",
