{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of API method signatures and parameter annotations, serving as SDK documentation or interface definitions for Tencent Cloud's SMH service.",
  "sources": "Method signatures and type annotations within comments or docstrings, describing API requests and responses.",
  "sinks": "There are no data flows or untrusted data inputs; the code does not process or handle data at runtime.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow exists; the code is purely descriptive documentation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious indicators are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of documentation comments detailing API methods, request types, and response types. There is no executable logic, data processing, network activity, or code injection. The structure and content are typical of SDK interface annotations. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with this benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign SDK documentation with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its nature. The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
