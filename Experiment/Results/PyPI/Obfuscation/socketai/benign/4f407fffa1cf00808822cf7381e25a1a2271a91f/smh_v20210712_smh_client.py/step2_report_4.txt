  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the provided code snippet and the context of supply chain security.\n\n**Summary of the code snippet:**\n- It appears to be a lengthy comment or docstring listing method signatures, request, and response types for various API endpoints related to Tencent Cloud's SMH service.\n- There is no executable logic, data handling, or network communication.\n- The content is primarily documentation, annotations, or method signatures.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Recognizes the code as documentation for API endpoints.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies that it's benign, purely descriptive, with no malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid. No malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1; describes parameter annotations.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly states it's non-executable, purely documentation, with no malicious indicators.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid. No security risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Again, documentation of API method parameters.\n- **Analysis:** No executable code, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, non-malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to previous, documentation of SDK models.\n- **Analysis:** No data flow, no executable logic, no malicious indicators.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Documentation with some redundant parameter annotations.\n- **Analysis:** No executable code, no signs of malicious activity. Slightly redundant but not suspicious.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, very low risk.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Presence of malware:** None detected. All reports correctly identify that this is documentation, not executable code.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed; the code is straightforward comments/type annotations.\n- **Security risk:** None evident; no hardcoded secrets, data leaks, or malicious logic.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The **scores** assigned across all reports are consistent and appropriate.\n- Given the nature of the code, **malware** and **obfuscated** scores should remain at **0**.\n- The **risk score** should also stay at **0**, as there's no evidence of security threats.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the provided reports' assessments. The code is purely documentation for SDK API signatures, with no malicious or suspicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate. The code is benign, purely descriptive, and poses no security threat. The scores are justified and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk.",
