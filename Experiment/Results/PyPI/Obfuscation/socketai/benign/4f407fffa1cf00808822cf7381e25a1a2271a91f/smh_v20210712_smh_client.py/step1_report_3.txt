{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a documentation or docstring segment listing request parameters and types for various API methods related to Tencent Cloud SMH service operations.",
  "sources": "The source reads are primarily from the parameter and type annotations within the comments and docstrings.",
  "sinks": "There are no clear sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or malicious effects, as this is just metadata/documentation.",
  "flows": "No executable data flow is present; the flow would be from input parameters (requests) to API handling, but none of this is shown explicitly in the code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a sequence of parameter annotations and descriptions with no executable or dynamic code. It contains no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. It is likely a code comment or docstring snippet, not actual logic.",
  "analysis": "The snippet is a docstring or comment block outlining API method parameters and their types for a Tencent Cloud SDK. It does not contain executable code, logic, or data handling. As it only documents interface signatures, there are no sources, sinks, or flows of untrusted data, nor any suspicious or malicious behavior evident. The content is consistent with standard SDK documentation and poses no security risk.",
  "conclusion": "This is a non-executable documentation snippet listing API request and response types. It shows no signs of malicious activity, malware, or security risks. It is likely part of SDK code comments. Therefore, the code is safe and non-malicious.",
