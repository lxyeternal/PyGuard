  "conclusion": "The dependency shows moderate suspicion primarily due to obfuscation and dynamic code execution techniques. Scores are justified and aligned with the evidence. No confirmed malicious payloads are present, but caution is warranted. Benign samples are correctly scored as safe. Overall, the security posture is acceptable with minor concern in the most suspicious report."
