  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be a Python module intended for some form of data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "Input data could originate from standard input, environment variables, or external modules invoked within the code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file operations, or system commands if present, but no such actions are evident in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (if any) through internal processing functions to sinks such as output, files, or network calls, none of which are explicitly shown here.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are observed. The code is straightforward with standard library usage.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a simple, well-structured Python module with no unusual language features or dynamic execution. No external or malicious behavior is detectable. The code lacks any suspicious input handling, data exfiltration, or malicious operations. The absence of network activity, file manipulation, or system commands suggests it is benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the analysis, the code shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate, non-malicious utility or module with no evident security issues.",
