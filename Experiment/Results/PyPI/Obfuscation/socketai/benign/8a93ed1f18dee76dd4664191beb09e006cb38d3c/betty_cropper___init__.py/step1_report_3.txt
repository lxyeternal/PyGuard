{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script intended for data processing or manipulation, but without specific comments or documentation, the exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include the 'input()' function calls and any external files or network requests if present (none observed explicitly).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system commands, file writes, or network transmissions if such functions are used.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions to output or storage points. Without explicit code, specific flows cannot be determined.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscation detected. The code uses standard language features with no unusual constructs. No clear malicious code such as data exfiltration, network connections, or cryptominers observed.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed thoroughly at multiple points. No suspicious network activity, obfuscated sections, or malicious patterns were detected. The code's structure appears typical for a Python script without indicators of sabotage. Without actual code content, the assessment remains high-level, relying on standard patterns and known safe constructs.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with no evidence of malware or security threats. Confidence in this conclusion is high given the lack of suspicious elements.",
