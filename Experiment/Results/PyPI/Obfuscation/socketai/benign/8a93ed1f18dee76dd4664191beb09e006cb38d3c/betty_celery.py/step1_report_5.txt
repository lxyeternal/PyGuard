  "purpose": "Configure and initialize a Celery application within a Django project for task management.",
  "sources": "Import statements, configuration functions, and settings data",
  "sinks": "Configuration calls that may process or execute data from settings or modules",
  "flows": "Import data -> Configure runner -> Set Celery configuration from settings -> Autodiscover tasks based on installed apps",
  "anomalies": "Use of a try-except block with a bare except, which suppresses all errors; variable name is obfuscated but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, initializes a Celery app with an obfuscated variable name, attempts to configure a runner with a broad exception suppression, and sets up Celery with Django settings, including autodiscovering tasks based on installed apps. There are no signs of malicious code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious data flows. The code appears to be standard setup code for integrating Celery with Django.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical Celery setup snippet for a Django project. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. The use of a bare except is a minor concern but not malicious.",
