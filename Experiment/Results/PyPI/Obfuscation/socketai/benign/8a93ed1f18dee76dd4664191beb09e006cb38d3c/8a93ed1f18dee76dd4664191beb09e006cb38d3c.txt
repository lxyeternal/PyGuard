      "confidence": 0.7,
      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, albeit obfuscated, setup script for a Python package. The obfuscation and malformed regex suggest an attempt to conceal the code's true nature but do not demonstrate active malicious activity. No indicators of malware such as network communication, data theft, or backdoors are evident. The risk level is low, but the obfuscation warrants cautious review, especially regarding the malformed regex which could be an error or intentional obfuscation."

      "conclusion": "The code is primarily environment setup with obfuscation and dynamic path modifications that could be used maliciously, but no evidence of malicious activity is present. The scores are appropriate; I recommend a malware score of approximately 0.1, obfuscation around 0.7, and risk around 0.4 to reflect suspicion without confirmed malicious behavior."

      "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated but legitimate image processing module with no current evidence of malicious behavior. The high obfuscation score is justified, but the malware score remains at zero due to lack of malicious activity. Overall security risk is low, though further static analysis could be considered to confirm the absence of hidden payloads."

No confirmed malicious payloads are present, but caution is warranted. Benign samples are correctly scored as safe. Overall, the security posture is acceptable with minor concern in the most suspicious report."
