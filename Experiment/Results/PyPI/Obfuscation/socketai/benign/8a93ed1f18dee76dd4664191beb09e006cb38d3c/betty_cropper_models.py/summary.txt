  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated but legitimate image processing module with no current evidence of malicious behavior. The high obfuscation score is justified, but the malware score remains at zero due to lack of malicious activity. Overall security risk is low, though further static analysis could be considered to confirm the absence of hidden payloads."
