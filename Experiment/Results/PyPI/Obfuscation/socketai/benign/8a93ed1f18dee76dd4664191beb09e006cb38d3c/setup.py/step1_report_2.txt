  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'betty', including dependencies, metadata, and test integration.",
  "sources": "Reading from 'requirements' directory for dependencies, reading '__init__.py' files within package directories, environment variables, and command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Reading files from package directories, executing pytest for testing, and potentially reading environment variables.",
  "flows": "Source: reading requirements and package files -> Sinks: dependency installation, test execution, and environment reads.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; functions that read package files and return data; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; code appears intentionally convoluted but does not execute malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs package setup operations: reading dependencies, package data, and __init__.py files, and configuring setup parameters. The use of obfuscated variable names and functions that read and process package files without executing or modifying external data suggest attempts to obscure the code's intent but do not indicate malicious behavior. The setup process involves no network communication, no data exfiltration, and no execution of untrusted code beyond reading package files. Test commands invoke pytest, which is standard. No suspicious behaviors such as data theft, code injection, backdoors, or system harm are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names. No malicious activity or security risks are detected. The obscurity appears to be for code clarity concealment rather than malicious intent. Overall security risk is low.",
