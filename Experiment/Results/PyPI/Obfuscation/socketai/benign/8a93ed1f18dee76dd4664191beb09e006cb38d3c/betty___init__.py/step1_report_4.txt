{
  "purpose": "The code imports future features for compatibility and imports a module as 'celery_app', then defines a version string.",
  "sources": "Import statement for '__future__' and the module 'celery' with a potentially obfuscated alias",
  "sinks": "The alias 'KPDseVnEDvsIzRxtVpNsSvljThlsqEiT' could be a sink if used maliciously, but in this context it is just an import alias",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources; the version string is static, and the import does not process external data",
  "anomalies": "Use of an obfuscated alias name for the imported module, which might conceal malicious intent or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code imports a future feature for compatibility, which is standard. The module 'celery' is imported with an alias that appears to be a random string, possibly obfuscated. The version string '2.6.1' is hardcoded. No external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The alias name could be used to conceal malicious behavior or simply to obfuscate the code's intent, but with this limited snippet, no malicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears minimal and standard but uses an obfuscated alias for the imported module, which could be a sign of intentional concealment. However, no direct malicious actions are observable within this snippet.",
