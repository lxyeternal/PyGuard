  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data handling or output operations",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks in this snippet",
  "anomalies": "Imported object name 'KPDseVnEDvsIzRxtVpNsSvljThlsqEiT' appears obfuscated; version string is straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, involving standard import statements with an obfuscated object name. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The obfuscated name could be for an internal identifier or a standard naming pattern. No suspicious network activity or secret handling is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple module import with an obfuscated object name. There are no clear signs of malicious intent or security risks based on this snippet alone.",
