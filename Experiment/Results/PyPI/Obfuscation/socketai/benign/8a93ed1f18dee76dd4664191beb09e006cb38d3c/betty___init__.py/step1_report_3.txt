{
  "purpose": "Import absolute_import for compatibility and import a specific object from a local module as celery_app, while defining a version string.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input data; it only imports a module and assigns a string to a variable.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network connections, file writes, or command executions are present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present; the code only initializes variables and imports.",
  "anomalies": "The import alias uses a seemingly random or obfuscated name, and the version string is a non-descriptive variable name, which could be an attempt to hide intent. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard feature for Python 2/3 compatibility and imports a specific object from a local module, aliasing it. The variable storing the version string has an obfuscated or non-descriptive name, possibly to obscure its purpose. No suspicious network, file, or system calls are present. The minimal code suggests it's a part of a larger system, likely setting up a Celery application, with no malicious intent evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward setup snippet for a Celery application, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. The obfuscated variable name could be an attempt at code hiding but does not necessarily indicate malicious intent.",
