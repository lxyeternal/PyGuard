{
  "purpose": "The code appears to initialize a module with a version string and import a specific object from a local 'celery' module, likely setting up task queue functionality.",
  "sources": "The code reads the version string assignment and imports from a relative module ('celery').",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "The import statement loads a specific object ('KPDseVnEDvsIzRxtVpNsSvljThlsqEiT') from a local module; the version string is assigned statically.",
  "anomalies": "The imported object name 'KPDseVnEDvsIzRxtVpNsSvljThlsqEiT' appears obfuscated or randomly generated, which can be suspicious. The variable name 'cUTOWnMXQtMtjkkwUwIJmwYchJckZGYD' is also a random string, possibly obfuscated. No other suspicious code or data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing a potentially obfuscated object from a local module and setting a version string. The use of obfuscated names could be benign, such as code obfuscation or autogenerated code. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, malicious network activity, or backdoors is present. The code structure is simple and does not include any dynamic execution or external input handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be standard module setup with obfuscated naming, possibly for concealment. No malicious activity or security risks are evident from this snippet alone.",
