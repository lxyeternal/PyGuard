  "purpose": "Minimal import of an obfuscated object from a local module and assignment of a version string.",
  "sources": "Import statement reading an obfuscated object from a local module; assignment of a version string.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, external inputs, or network activities present.",
  "flows": "Import of obfuscated object to alias; assignment of version string; no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated object and variable names; absence of context or additional logic; no malicious code or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, involving a standard import with an obfuscated object name and a version string. No external inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present. The obfuscated names could be for internal reasons or code obfuscation, but do not inherently indicate malicious intent. The scores across reports correctly reflect the lack of malicious behavior, with high obfuscation scores justified by the obfuscated identifiers. Malware scores are zero, and risk scores are very low, consistent with the minimal code and absence of suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign; obfuscation is the only red flag but does not indicate malicious intent in this context. The scores are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
