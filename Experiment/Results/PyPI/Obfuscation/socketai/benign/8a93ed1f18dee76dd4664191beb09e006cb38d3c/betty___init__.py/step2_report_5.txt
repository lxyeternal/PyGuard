  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n**Code snippet for reference:**\n```python\nfrom __future__ import absolute_import\nfrom .celery import KPDseVnEDvsIzRxtVpNsSvljThlsqEiT as celery_app\ncUTOWnMXQtMtjkkwUwIJmwYchJckZGYD = \"2.6.1\"\n```\n\n---\n\n### General observations:\n- The code is minimal, involving standard import statements.\n- The imported object and variable names are obfuscated or appear random.\n- No external inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- The version string is static.\n- The obfuscated names could be for internal concealment or code obfuscation, but do not inherently indicate malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** No signs of malicious behavior; obfuscated object name is benign.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.7\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is minimal, and obfuscation alone does not imply maliciousness here. The low malware and risk scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Obfuscated names could be suspicious but no malicious activity detected.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.8\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** The high confidence is justified given the obfuscation, but without evidence of malicious behavior, malware remains zero. The risk score is appropriately low.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Similar to above; obfuscated variable names, no malicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.3\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** The lower obfuscation score reflects less suspicion, which aligns with the code. The reasoning is consistent.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Obfuscated alias, but no malicious activity; standard import.\n- **Confidence:** 0.7\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.4\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** The cautious approach is appropriate. The risk score is slightly higher due to the obfuscation, which is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Obfuscated names, but no malicious activity; standard import.\n- **Confidence:** 0.6\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.6\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** The balanced scoring reflects the cautious stance on obfuscation without evidence of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, which is consistent given the code snippet. No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** Moderate, justified by the obfuscated names. Some reports assign higher obfuscation scores; this is reasonable.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low, reflecting the minimal code and lack of suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- The scores across reports are consistent and reasonable.\n- No adjustments needed unless further context suggests malicious intent.\n- The high confidence levels are justified based on the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall assessment:**\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0.6 (average of the reports, leaning towards moderate obfuscation)  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal risk, standard import pattern)\n\nThe code appears benign, with obfuscation being the only suspicious aspect, which in itself does not imply maliciousness.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are well-reasoned and consistent. The scores are appropriate given the minimal, obfuscated code snippet. No further action or suspicion is warranted based solely on this snippet.",
