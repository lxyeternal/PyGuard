{
  "purpose": "The code appears to import a future feature and then imports a specific object from a local module named 'celery', likely setting up a Celery application, and defines a version string.",
  "sources": "Input source is the import statement from __future__ and the local module 'celery'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or output are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only imports modules and sets a version string.",
  "anomalies": "The imported object 'KPDseVnEDvsIzRxtVpNsSvljThlsqEiT' has an obfuscated or randomly generated name, which could be suspicious. The variable 'cUTOWnMXQtMtjkkwUwIJmwYchJckZGYD' is also a nonsensical string, possibly obfuscated. No other unusual patterns or hardcoded secrets are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and mostly consists of import statements and a version string. The import from __future__ is standard for compatibility. The import of a specific object with a complex name from a local module suggests some level of obfuscation or code generation, which could be benign or malicious depending on context. The version string indicates versioning info. No malicious actions, data leaks, or suspicious behavior are directly observable in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself does not exhibit clear malicious behavior but includes obfuscated variable and import names, which warrants caution if sourced from untrusted origins. No active malicious actions are evident.",
