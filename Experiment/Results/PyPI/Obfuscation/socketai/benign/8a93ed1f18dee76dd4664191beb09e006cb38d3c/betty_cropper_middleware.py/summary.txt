  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of API token validation with obfuscated naming. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain attack vectors. Obfuscation warrants attention but does not justify high malware or risk scores. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
