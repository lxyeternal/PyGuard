  "purpose": "Define generic type classes for list and tuple with custom behaviors, including compatibility handling for different Python versions.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class definitions, and type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks or untrusted data flows; no network, file, or sensitive data access observed.",
  "flows": "Type annotations and class inheritance flow without involving untrusted input or external data sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic type creation with sys.version_info checks and custom class metaclasses; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines generic classes for Listx and Tuplex with version-specific handling, using T._GenericAlias for Python >= 3.7 and type() for older versions. No external data inputs, network operations, or file access are present. The classes appear to be part of a typing utility module, with metaclasses to enforce type behaviors. No malicious patterns, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation, are present. The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose related to type hinting and compatibility across Python versions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard type utility implementation without malicious intent or security risks. It employs version-aware dynamic class creation for type annotations, which is common in typing libraries. No malware or suspicious behavior detected.",
