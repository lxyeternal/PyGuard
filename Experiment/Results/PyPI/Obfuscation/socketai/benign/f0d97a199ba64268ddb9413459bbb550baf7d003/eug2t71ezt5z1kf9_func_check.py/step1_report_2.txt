{
  "purpose": "Decorator function to enforce type validation on functions, wrapping the original function with input/output validation logic.",
  "sources": "The code reads function definitions, function signatures, and function parameters for validation. It also accesses module imports.",
  "sinks": "The code performs runtime type validation and raises TypeError if validation fails, but does not perform any malicious actions such as data exfiltration or system modification.",
  "flows": "Input data (function parameters) are validated through custom logic; validated data flows into the original function call; output is validated before returning.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated or non-descriptive variable names; import statements use relative imports, which are not inherently malicious but can be used to hide behavior; no external network calls or system modifications observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator 'CLvYDqNCnkCYiBSiAgAVtzHYYpioMmon' which wraps a given function to enforce runtime type validation. It inspects the function's signature, constructs input parameter schemas, and compares actual inputs against expected types, raising errors on mismatch. It does not include any code that communicates externally, alters system files, or performs malicious activities. The code structure suggests obfuscation via non-meaningful variable names, but the logic is consistent with a runtime type enforcement utility. No suspicious network, file, or privilege-escalation behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code appears to be a runtime type validation decorator that enforces input/output type correctness for functions. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malicious data handling, or sabotage. The obfuscated variable names could be an attempt to hide intent, but the functionality is benign and aligns with common validation practices.",
