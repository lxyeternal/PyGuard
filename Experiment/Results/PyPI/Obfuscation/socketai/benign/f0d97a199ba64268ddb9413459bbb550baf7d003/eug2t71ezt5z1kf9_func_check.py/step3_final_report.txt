  "purpose": "Decorator for runtime validation of function inputs and outputs, enforcing type and value correctness.",
  "sources": "Function signature parameters, default values, and kwargs passed to the decorator-wrapped function.",
  "sinks": "Validation function `BMgMSumQbNUXdTlErTcQYLVNfOgkYqgA` which checks data; potential for data exfiltration if malicious, but no evidence here.",
  "flows": "Function parameters are inspected, schemas are built, data is validated via external function, and validation results determine execution flow.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with non-descriptive variable names; no malicious code or suspicious external calls observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a validation decorator that inspects function signatures, constructs validation schemas, and uses an external validation function. Variable names are intentionally obfuscated, but the logic aligns with standard runtime validation patterns. No network, file, or system modifications are present. The external validation function's behavior is unknown but appears to be a benign utility. No signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, code injection, or privilege escalation are evident. The obfuscation seems superficial, likely for concealment or code generation purposes. The malware score is 0, risk is low (~0.2), and obfuscation is moderate (~0.7). The confidence in these conclusions is high (~0.9).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign runtime validation decorator with superficial obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
