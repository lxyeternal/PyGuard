  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module for type utilities with no malicious intent or security risks. The obfuscated variable name is superficial and does not indicate malicious activity. The security risk and malware scores should remain at 0, with a slight obfuscation score around 0.3 to reflect the non-descriptive variable name. Overall, the code is safe and poses no supply chain threat."
