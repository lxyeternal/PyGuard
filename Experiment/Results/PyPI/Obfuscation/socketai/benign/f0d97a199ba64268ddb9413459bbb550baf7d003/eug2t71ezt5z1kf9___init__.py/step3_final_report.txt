{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module for type annotations, utility functions, and import declarations, primarily setting up type-related utilities and exporting them.",
  "sources": "Import statements from various modules and the assignment of a version string to an obfuscated variable.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, network calls, file operations, or data leaks are present. The code only imports and defines exports.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is static and only involves import and export declarations.",
  "anomalies": "The variable name 'tVigNRVrDDsAPtlPddOBmIGFKbxdsxbQ' is obfuscated but only contains a benign version string ('0.6.0'). No suspicious patterns or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module setup for type annotations and utility functions, with an obfuscated but harmless version string variable. There are no dynamic code executions, network interactions, or data processing from untrusted sources. The obfuscation appears superficial, likely for non-security reasons. The import structure is standard, and no anomalies or malicious behaviors are evident. The overall security posture is benign, with minimal risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module for type utilities with no malicious intent or security risks. The obfuscated variable name is superficial and does not indicate malicious activity. The security risk and malware scores should remain at 0, with a slight obfuscation score around 0.3 to reflect the non-descriptive variable name. Overall, the code is safe and poses no supply chain threat.",
