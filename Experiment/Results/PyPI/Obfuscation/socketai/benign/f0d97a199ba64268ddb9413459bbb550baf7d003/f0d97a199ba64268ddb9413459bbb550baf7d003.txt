      "obfuscated": 0.8,
      "confidence": 0.7,
      "conclusion": "The code does not contain explicit malicious behavior but is poorly written, obfuscated, and syntactically invalid. The obfuscation and incomplete code suggest potential concealment, but no direct malicious activity is detected. The risk is moderate, primarily due to obfuscation and syntax errors, which should be addressed before use."

      "obfuscated": 0.3,
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a benign module for type utilities with no malicious intent or security risks. The obfuscated variable name is superficial and does not indicate malicious activity. The security risk and malware scores should remain at 0, with a slight obfuscation score around 0.3 to reflect the non-descriptive variable name. Overall, the code is safe and poses no supply chain threat."

      "obfuscated": 0.75,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is a sophisticated, obfuscated validation utility with no evidence of malicious intent. While the obfuscation and dynamic features could potentially be exploited to hide malicious behavior, the current analysis indicates it functions as a validation library. The malware score is set to 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2), with high obfuscation (~0.75). Caution is advised due to obfuscation, but no malicious activity is detected."

      "obfuscated": 0.6,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is a compatibility utility for defining generic types with obfuscated identifiers. No evidence of malicious activity or vulnerabilities is present. The main concerns are obfuscation and an external module with unknown content, which should be reviewed further. Overall, the security risk is low, and malware likelihood is negligible."

The obfuscation is notable but justified given the context. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration are evident."
