{
  "purpose": "The code appears to load and manage application settings/configuration from YAML files, environment variables, and profiles, providing a structured, immutable interface to configuration data.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., SELVA_SETTINGS_DIR, SELVA_SETTINGS_FILE, SELVA_PROFILE), file system (loading YAML configuration files from specified paths)",
  "sinks": "Loading configuration data into internal data structures; no evidence of untrusted data leading to execution or system modifications",
  "flows": "Environment variables and profile parameters influence file paths; configuration files are loaded and parsed; data is merged into internal structures",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors detected. The code uses standard libraries for configuration management and avoids unsafe code execution. The configuration merging is deep but appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code loads configuration settings from YAML files, with support for profiles and environment variables. It deep copies data to prevent side-effects and provides a mapping interface for accessing configuration data. No obfuscated or malicious code constructs are present. The only potential concern could be loading untrusted YAML files, but this is a common pattern and not inherently malicious. No suspicious network activity, code injection, or backdoors are identified. The code includes normal error handling for missing files or errors during loading, with no signs of covert channels or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration loader with no indications of malicious intent or malware. It manages configuration data securely and transparently, with no suspicious behaviors. Overall, it is safe and performs common configuration management functions.",
