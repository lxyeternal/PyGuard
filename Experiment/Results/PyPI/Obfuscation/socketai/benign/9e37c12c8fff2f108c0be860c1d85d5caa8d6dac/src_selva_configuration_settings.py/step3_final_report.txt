{
  "purpose": "The code manages configuration loading, merging, and environment variable handling for application settings, ensuring flexible and recursive configuration management.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (e.g., SELVA_SETTINGS_FILE, SELVA_SETTINGS_DIR, environment variables for profiles), YAML configuration files, and data from deep copies of initial settings.",
  "sinks": "Loads configuration data into in-memory structures; no data is sent over networks or written to files within this code segment.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and file paths serve as sources; data is loaded via YAML and merged into configuration objects; no external sinks or data exfiltration points are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected. The code uses standard libraries and practices for configuration management.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard configuration management tasks: loading from environment variables, YAML files, recursive variable replacement, and merging data structures. It does not include network calls, code injection, or malicious behaviors. The use of deep copies and safe YAML loading indicates careful handling of data. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The environment variable handling for profiles and file paths is typical for configurable applications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard configuration loader and merger with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The overall security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscation scores are zero. The risk score is slightly above zero (around 0.2) due to potential risks inherent in loading external configuration data, but no active threats are evident.",
