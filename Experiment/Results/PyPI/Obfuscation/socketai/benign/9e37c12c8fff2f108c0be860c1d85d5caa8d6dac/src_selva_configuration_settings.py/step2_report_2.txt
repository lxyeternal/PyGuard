  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, reasoning, and scoring consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code manages configuration loading, merging, and environment variable handling. No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malware signals are detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code is standard for configuration management. The low risk score aligns with the benign analysis. No issues found.\n\n**Conclusion:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on YAML loading, environment variables, and merging. No malicious activity observed.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent; the low risk score matches the benign nature. No suspicious code or behavior.\n\n**Conclusion:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard configuration loading, with no signs of malicious behavior. Focus on environment variables and YAML files.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is solid; no anomalies or malicious signals. The risk score is appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—configuration loading, merging, environment variables, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Conclusion:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on safe configuration management, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2\n- **Assessment:** Properly aligned with the benign analysis.\n\n**Conclusion:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting low security risk, which is appropriate given the benign functions.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, standard configuration management code)\n\n---\n\n### **Key Justifications:**\n\n- The code performs configuration loading, merging, and environment variable handling—common, well-understood patterns.\n- No network activity, code injection, credential handling, or other malicious behaviors are present.\n- The recursive variable replacement and YAML loading are standard practices, not inherently malicious.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:** The current scores are appropriate; no adjustments necessary. The code is benign and poses minimal security risk.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0.1   |\n\nThis assessment confirms the code is safe, with no signs of malware or obfuscation, and a very low security risk score.",
