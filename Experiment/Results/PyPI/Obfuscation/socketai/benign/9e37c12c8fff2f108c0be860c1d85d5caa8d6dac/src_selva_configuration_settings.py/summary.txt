  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard configuration loader and merger with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The overall security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscation scores are zero. The risk score is slightly above zero (around 0.2) due to potential risks inherent in loading external configuration data, but no active threats are evident."
