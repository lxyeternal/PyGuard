{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to load, manage, and process application configuration settings from environment variables, YAML files, and defaults, providing a structured configuration object.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., SELVA_SETTINGS_DIR, SELVA_SETTINGS_FILE, SELVA_PROFILE), filesystem (loading YAML configuration files).",
  "sinks": "Potentially, loaded configuration data could be used insecurely if misconfigured, but there are no direct data sinks such as network transmission or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and filesystem inputs (sources) flow into YAML loading and recursive variable replacements, resulting in a configuration object (sink). No external or untrusted data flows are evident beyond configuration loading.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors are present. The code structure is standard for configuration management. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes and functions for loading and managing application settings securely. It reads environment variables to determine configuration paths, loads YAML files safely, and merges configurations recursively. The use of deep copies and caching improves efficiency. No suspicious or malicious behavior, such as network activity, credential theft, or code injection, is observed. The code is clean, structured, and adheres to common best practices for configuration handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration loader with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It manages application settings securely and efficiently without evident security risks or malware. No signs of sabotage or malicious code are detected.",
