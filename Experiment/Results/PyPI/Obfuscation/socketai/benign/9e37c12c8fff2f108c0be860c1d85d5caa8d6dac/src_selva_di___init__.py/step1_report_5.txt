  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility functions, but without actual code provided, the specific intent cannot be precisely determined.",
  "sources": "The code reads input or data from environment variables, function parameters, or external data sources (not specified due to lack of code).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or data output functions, but specific locations cannot be identified without the actual code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (input, environment variables) to sinks (network, files, outputs) via function calls or data processing steps. Exact flows cannot be determined without code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are identifiable without the actual code snippet provided.",
  "analysis": "Due to the absence of actual code content, a detailed step-by-step analysis cannot be performed. No hardcoded secrets, malicious constructs, or unusual behaviors are observable from the provided prompt. The code's structure, usage, and potential risks cannot be assessed without further detail.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the lack of provided code, there are no identifiable malicious behaviors or security risks. The code appears benign, but a thorough review requires the actual source code.",
