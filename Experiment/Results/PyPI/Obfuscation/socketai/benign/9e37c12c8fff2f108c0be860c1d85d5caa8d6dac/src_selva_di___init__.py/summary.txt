  "conclusion": "The code shows potential malicious behavior primarily due to dynamic execution and network activity, with obfuscation patterns. While no definitive malicious payloads are confirmed, the suspicious patterns justify a malware score of 0.4, obfuscation score of 0.6, and security risk of 0.6. Overall, the code warrants cautious handling, but no immediate malicious activity is confirmed."
