  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, network activity, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), ambiguous variable names.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, data processing functions, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables and dynamic code execution flow into network activity and data handling functions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval/exec, network activity, ambiguous variable names, obfuscated patterns in code.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits suspicious patterns including dynamic code execution and network activity, which are common indicators of malicious intent. Obfuscated variable names further suggest obfuscation efforts. No explicit malicious payloads like data exfiltration or cryptomining are confirmed, but the suspicious patterns justify elevated concern. The code's benign appearance in some reports is consistent with lack of malicious activity, but the presence of obfuscation and dynamic execution warrants cautious scoring.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows potential malicious behavior primarily due to dynamic execution and network activity, with obfuscation patterns. While no definitive malicious payloads are confirmed, the suspicious patterns justify a malware score of 0.4, obfuscation score of 0.6, and security risk of 0.6. Overall, the code warrants cautious handling, but no immediate malicious activity is confirmed.",
