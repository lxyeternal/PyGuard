{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a Python script intended for data processing or utility functions, with no immediately evident malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly shown; potential sources could include environment variables, user input, or files if present elsewhere.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or subprocess executions, but none are evident in the provided code fragment.",
  "flows": "No clear source-to-sink data flows are observable in the provided code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated patterns are apparent. The code structure and variable names seem straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code contains standard Python constructs, imports, and function definitions. It does not perform any network operations, execute system commands, or manipulate sensitive data. The absence of suspicious imports, obfuscated code, or data leaks suggests a benign purpose. Without external inputs or operations shown, no anomalous behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code fragment, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears standard and safe. Due to the limited scope, confidence in this assessment is high.",
