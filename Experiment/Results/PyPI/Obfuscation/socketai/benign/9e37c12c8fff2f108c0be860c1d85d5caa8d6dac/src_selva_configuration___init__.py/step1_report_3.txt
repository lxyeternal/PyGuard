  "purpose": "Import a specific class or variable from a configuration settings module in the selva package.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads from 'selva.configuration.settings' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks of untrusted data, no execution of untrusted input or data flows observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink; import is static and direct.",
  "anomalies": "The imported name 'IhwYaxuBHDUVcHTAffkscppvwSVFHVfS' appears as a nonsensical, obfuscated identifier, which could be an attempt to hide malicious intent or obscure code functionality.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple import statement. The imported identifier is a long, seemingly random string, which might be an obfuscated or generated name. This pattern is often used to hide malicious variables or backdoors. There is no other code, no function calls, no data processing. The presence of a highly obfuscated variable name warrants suspicion but is not conclusive alone. No other malicious indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a single import statement with an obfuscated variable or class name. While this alone is not proof of malicious behavior, it raises suspicion about obfuscation or concealment of malicious code in the broader context. No explicit malicious activity or security risk is detected here, but the obfuscation warrants caution.",
