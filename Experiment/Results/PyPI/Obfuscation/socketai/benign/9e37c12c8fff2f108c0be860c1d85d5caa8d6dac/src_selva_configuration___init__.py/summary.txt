  "conclusion": "The import statement is syntactically correct but involves a highly obfuscated attribute name, which warrants further review. No evidence of malicious activity or data exfiltration is present. The suspicion is limited to obfuscation, and the current scores appropriately reflect a moderate concern without confirmed malicious intent."
