  "purpose": "Import a specific attribute from a module within the selva.configuration.settings package.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads data from the module 'selva.configuration.settings'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network, file system, or environment variables are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The code imports a potentially obfuscated or randomly named attribute, but no data flow is visible beyond this import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The attribute name 'IhwYaxuBHDUVcHTAffkscppvwSVFHVfS' appears to be a random or obfuscated string, which could suggest malicious intent or obfuscation. No other code provided for further context.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement for a specific attribute from a module. The attribute name appears suspiciously random, which may indicate obfuscation or malicious intent, such as hiding malicious code or secrets. Without additional context or code, it is not possible to determine if malicious behavior is present, but the suspicious attribute name warrants caution. The code itself does not execute anything or access sensitive data directly.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement contains a highly suspicious attribute name that could be used to conceal malicious code or secrets. However, with only this snippet, there is no definitive malicious activity, but the obfuscated attribute name suggests further review is necessary.",
