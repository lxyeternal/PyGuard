  "purpose": "Import a specific class or object from the 'selva.configuration.settings' module.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from an external module 'selva.configuration.settings'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present in this line; no data is being output or sent to external systems.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the module 'selva.configuration.settings' into the local namespace via import.",
  "anomalies": "The imported name 'IhwYaxuBHDUVcHTAffkscppvwSVFHVfS' appears as a random or obfuscated identifier, possibly indicating obfuscation or malicious intent. No other code present to analyze further.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement that pulls a potentially obfuscated object or class from an external module. The name looks suspiciously random, which could suggest obfuscation or an attempt to hide malicious intent. Without additional context or code, it's impossible to determine the behavior or malicious nature definitively. The line alone does not perform any malicious activity but raises suspicion due to the naming convention.",
  "conclusion": "The code only performs an import of a suspiciously named object from an external module. While the import itself is harmless, the obfuscated name warrants caution. More context is needed to confirm whether this is malicious, but based on this snippet alone, it appears as potentially obfuscated or intentionally hidden.",
