  "purpose": "Import a specific attribute 'IhwYaxuBHDUVcHTAffkscppvwSVFHVfS' from the module 'selva.configuration.settings'.",
  "sources": "Import statement accessing a potentially obscure attribute in an external module.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; no malicious data flow observed.",
  "flows": "Import statement reads attribute from module, but no data flow beyond that.",
  "anomalies": "The attribute name 'IhwYaxuBHDUVcHTAffkscppvwSVFHVfS' appears to be a nonsensical or obfuscated string, possibly indicating an attempt to hide malicious intent or simply an obscure naming scheme. No other code present to analyze.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single import statement, importing an attribute with an unusually long and complex name. No additional code, functions, or data flows are provided. The attribute name could be a randomly generated string or obfuscated, which might be suspicious, but without context or further code, this is inconclusive. The module 'selva.configuration.settings' itself is standard, but the specific attribute is suspiciously complex.",
  "conclusion": "This isolated import statement alone does not confirm malicious behavior but raises suspicion due to the obscure attribute name. Without more context, it's not possible to definitively determine malicious intent, but there is a potential for obfuscation or hidden data. Further investigation of the module's contents is recommended.",
