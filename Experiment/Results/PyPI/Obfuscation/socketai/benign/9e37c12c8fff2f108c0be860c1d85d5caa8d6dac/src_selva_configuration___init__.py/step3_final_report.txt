  "purpose": "Assessment of a single import statement with an obfuscated attribute from 'selva.configuration.settings' for potential malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no additional data or code flows are provided.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data flows or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; only a static import statement present.",
  "anomalies": "The attribute name 'IhwYaxuBHDUVcHTAffkscppvwSVFHVfS' is highly obfuscated or nonsensical, raising suspicion of obfuscation or concealment.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement importing a single attribute with an obfuscated name. No other code, data flows, or malicious activities are evident. The suspicion stems solely from the obfuscated naming pattern, which could indicate intentional concealment but does not confirm malicious intent. The scores across reports reflect high obfuscation suspicion (0.7-0.8), low malware likelihood (0.0-0.2), and moderate security risk (0.2-0.4). Without inspecting the actual module content, the risk remains speculative. The scores are consistent with cautious assessment based on naming alone. Further investigation into the module's contents and purpose of the attribute is recommended to clarify whether this is benign obfuscation or malicious concealment.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is syntactically correct but involves a highly obfuscated attribute name, which warrants further review. No evidence of malicious activity or data exfiltration is present. The suspicion is limited to obfuscation, and the current scores appropriately reflect a moderate concern without confirmed malicious intent.",
