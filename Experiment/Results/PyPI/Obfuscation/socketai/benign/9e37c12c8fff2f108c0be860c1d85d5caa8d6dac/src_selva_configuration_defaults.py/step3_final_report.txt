  "purpose": "Static configuration object defining application components such as logging, templates, data sources, static files, and uploads.",
  "sources": "No input sources; static data within the dictionary.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or external data output.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static assignment without dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable name 'jXdMxwGJmnXupwUeVQYWYFkbeYWpohAa' is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static configuration dictionary with nested keys for application setup. The variable name appears obfuscated but is likely just a placeholder or naming convention. There are no input handlers, data flows, or executable code. The references to modules like 'selva.logging:setup' are typical in web app configurations. No signs of malicious code, data leaks, or external network activity are present. The obfuscation does not imply malicious intent, and the static nature indicates benign configuration data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static configuration object with an obfuscated variable name. There are no signs of malware, supply chain compromise, or security risks. The current scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
