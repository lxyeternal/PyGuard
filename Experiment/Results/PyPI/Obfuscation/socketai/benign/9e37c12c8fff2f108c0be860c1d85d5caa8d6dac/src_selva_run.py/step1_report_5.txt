  "purpose": "Initialize environment variables and set up the application's configuration, dependency container, and web application instance.",
  "sources": "dotenv.init() reads environment variables; import statements load modules and potentially execute code; wJkfVBUMpXSGQtgAwvxqKEpjwiPhohuz() and Container() instantiate objects; Selva() initializes the web application.",
  "sinks": "Instantiation of Selva with configuration and container objects, potentially involving network setup or server initialization.",
  "flows": "dotenv.init() -> configuration object wJkfVBUMpXSGQtgAwvxqKEpjwiPhohuz() -> container instantiation -> web application initialization.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names (e.g., xzWAhJREUupkLGLcBYTsPaXblIprhRMn) and function names; no explicit malicious code or data flows evident; reliance on external modules with possible hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes environment variables via dotenv, then creates configuration and container objects with obfuscated variable names. The final step constructs a web application instance with these objects. There are no explicit data leaks, hardcoded credentials, or network communications visible. The obfuscation and reliance on external modules could conceal malicious activities, but based solely on this snippet, no malicious behavior or malicious code patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to perform standard application setup tasks, with no clear signs of malicious activity. The obfuscated variable names and imported modules should be reviewed in their entirety for complete assurance, but this snippet alone does not indicate malicious behavior.",
