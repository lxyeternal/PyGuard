  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks identified in this fragment.",
  "flows": "dotenv.init() -> configuration loader (wJkfVBUMpXSGQtgAwvxqKEpjwiPhohuz()) -> container creation -> web app instantiation",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated variable names; reliance on external modules with obfuscated or unclear internal behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup routines: initializing environment variables, loading configuration via an obfuscated function, creating dependency container, and instantiating a web application. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code execution is evident. The obfuscation of variable names raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. The external modules' internal behaviors are unknown, which could conceal malicious code, but based solely on this fragment, no malicious activity is detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated ~0.6, risk=0.2) are consistent with this assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign initialization routine with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities in this fragment. The obfuscation warrants further review of external modules, but based on the provided code, the security risk is low and no malware is present.",
