  "purpose": "Initialize environment variables and configure a web application using imported modules and settings.",
  "sources": "dotenv.init() reads environment variables; wJkfVBUMpXSGQtgAwvxqKEpjwiPhohuz() and Container() likely read configuration data; Selva constructor may read configuration and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No obvious sinks are present that handle untrusted data or lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "Environment initialization (dotenv.init()) and configuration data flow into the application setup (Selva).",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated variable names that do not clearly describe their purpose, but no malicious or suspicious activity is evident. No hardcoded secrets or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily initializes environment variables and configuration objects, then constructs a web application instance. Variable names are obfuscated but do not inherently indicate malicious intent. No data is sent over the network, no system files are modified, and no suspicious logic is present. Usage of imported modules appears standard for configuration and setup. The only notable aspect is the obfuscated variable names, which may hinder code comprehension but do not suggest malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to perform standard environment and application setup without any malicious activity or security risks. The obfuscation of variable names is suspicious but not indicative of malicious intent based on this snippet alone.",
