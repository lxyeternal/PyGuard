  "purpose": "Analysis of Python code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks, focusing on potential supply chain threats.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, file reads, network interactions, eval/exec usage, obfuscated code segments.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, environment variables, file system, dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or files feed into eval/exec or network functions, potentially leading to malicious actions or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec, high obfuscation scores, complex data handling, dynamic features, potential concealment of malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits typical signals of obfuscation and dynamic execution, especially in reports 3 and 4. eval/exec usage and network interactions raise moderate suspicion. Obfuscation scores are high where indicated, aligning with potential concealment. Malware suspicion is moderate, justified by risky functions and obfuscation, but no definitive malicious payload is confirmed. The overall security risk is moderate, reflecting potential exploitation avenues without confirmed malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows signs of obfuscation and potential misuse of dynamic execution functions, warranting cautious review. Scores are generally consistent with the observed features, with slight adjustments to reflect the moderate threat level. Overall, the package poses a moderate security concern primarily due to obfuscation and dynamic code features, but no confirmed malicious activity is detected.",
