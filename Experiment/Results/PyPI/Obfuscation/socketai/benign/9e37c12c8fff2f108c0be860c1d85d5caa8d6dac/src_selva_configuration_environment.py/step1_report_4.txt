  "purpose": "Compile a regular expression pattern for matching variable placeholders in a specific syntax.",
  "sources": "re.compile() function with a regex pattern string.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; pattern compilation is static.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code compiles a regex pattern but does not process untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; pattern is a standard regex for variable placeholders, no suspicious constructs or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 're' module and compiles a regex pattern that appears to match variable placeholders of the form '${ variable }' with optional default values. The regex uses verbose mode for clarity. There are no data inputs, network calls, or untrusted data handling. No obfuscation or malicious code structures are present. The pattern is straightforward and does not exhibit signs of malware or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code's purpose is to define a regex pattern for template variable parsing. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is a benign utility function with no suspicious activity.",
