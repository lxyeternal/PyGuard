  "purpose": "Define a regular expression pattern to match template-like strings with optional default values, likely for configuration or templating purposes.",
  "sources": "re.compile function, reading the raw regex pattern string",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or output observed; the code only compiles a regex pattern",
  "flows": "Input string (to be matched) would flow into the compiled regex for matching operations elsewhere",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious constructs detected. The regex pattern is straightforward and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and compiles a regex pattern that matches expressions of the form '${name}' or '${name:default}', allowing optional spaces. No dynamic execution, data leaks, or malicious behavior is evident. The pattern appears intended for string templating or variable substitution. The code snippet is partial but shows no suspicious activity or security risks in its current form.",
  "conclusion": "The code defines a regex pattern for template matching, which is benign and used for parsing templates or configuration strings. No malicious behavior, malware, or security issues are detected based on the provided snippet.",
