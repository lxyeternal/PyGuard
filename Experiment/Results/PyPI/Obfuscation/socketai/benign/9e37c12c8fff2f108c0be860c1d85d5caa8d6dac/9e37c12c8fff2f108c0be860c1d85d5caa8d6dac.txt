      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign initialization routine with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities in this fragment. The obfuscation warrants further review of external modules, but based on the provided code, the security risk is low and no malware is present."

Scores are generally consistent with the observed features, with slight adjustments to reflect the moderate threat level. Overall, the package poses a moderate security concern primarily due to obfuscation and dynamic code features, but no confirmed malicious activity is detected."

Its obfuscation appears stylistic or for concealment but does not imply malicious intent. The overall security risk is low, and the code can be considered benign."

No evidence of malicious activity or data exfiltration is present. The suspicion is limited to obfuscation, and the current scores appropriately reflect a moderate concern without confirmed malicious intent."

The overall security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscation scores are zero. The risk score is slightly above zero (around 0.2) due to potential risks inherent in loading external configuration data, but no active threats are evident."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code shows potential malicious behavior primarily due to dynamic execution and network activity, with obfuscation patterns. While no definitive malicious payloads are confirmed, the suspicious patterns justify a malware score of 0.4, obfuscation score of 0.6, and security risk of 0.6. Overall, the code warrants cautious handling, but no immediate malicious activity is confirmed."

      "conclusion": "The primary concern is in the report highlighting obfuscation and dynamic execution, which warrants a higher malware score (~0.5) and risk score (~0.5). The other reports are benign, with scores accurately reflecting their content. Adjustments are recommended for the most suspicious report to better represent the potential hidden risks."
