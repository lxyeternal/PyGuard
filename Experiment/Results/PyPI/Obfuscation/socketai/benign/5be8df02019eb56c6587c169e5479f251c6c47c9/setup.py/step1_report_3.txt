  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'q37nze98j5s3l1hq' that provides weighted quantile functions based on numpy.",
  "sources": "Data sources include hardcoded string lists for package dependencies and package metadata variables.",
  "sinks": "The code executes the setup() function to install the package with specified requirements and metadata.",
  "flows": "Input data (dependency lists and metadata) flow into the setup() function call, which then processes this data for package installation.",
  "anomalies": "The variable names appear obfuscated or randomly generated, but no malicious or suspicious code, such as network calls, system modifications, or hidden behavior, is evident. No use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded credentials or data leaks detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools, defines obfuscated variable names for dependencies and metadata, and then calls setup() with those variables. All data are static strings or lists, with no user input or untrusted data sources. The purpose is straightforward package setup without any signs of malicious activity. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious behavior are apparent in the code structure or content.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup.py file for packaging a Python module, with obfuscated variable names but no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears to be a benign package installation script.",
