  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the code, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a standard `setup.py` script for packaging a Python module, with obfuscated variable names.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks are present.\n- The variables contain static strings and lists, used solely for package configuration.\n- No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are evident.\n- The obfuscation appears superficial, likely intended to hinder readability but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n**Summary:**\n- Purpose: Define package setup parameters.\n- Findings: Obfuscated variable names, no malicious code, standard setup script.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code matches the description.\n- No issues found.\n- Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n**Summary:**\n- Purpose: Setup script for packaging/distribution.\n- Findings: Obfuscated names, no suspicious activity.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code is standard.\n- The slight security risk score (0.1) is acceptable given obfuscation, but no actual risk exists.\n- Scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n**Summary:**\n- Purpose: Package setup for weighted quantile functions.\n- Findings: Obfuscated variable names, no malicious behavior.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code is straightforward.\n- Obfuscation is superficial.\n- Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n**Summary:**\n- Purpose: Package configuration.\n- Findings: Obfuscated names, no malicious activity.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The analysis aligns with the code.\n- The slight security risk score is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n**Summary:**\n- Purpose: Package setup.\n- Findings: Obfuscated variable names, no malicious activity.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code is benign.\n- Obfuscation does not imply malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Conclusions:**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** They vary between 0.2 and 0.8, which is reasonable given the superficial obfuscation.\n- **Risk scores:** Generally low (0 or 0.1), appropriate for a benign setup script.\n\n---\n\n### **My final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports — consistent with the code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Considering the variable names are intentionally obscure but contain no malicious logic, I would assign an obfuscated score around **0.3** to **0.4**.\n- **Risk score:** Since there's no malicious activity, a risk score of **0** or **0.1** is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk  |\n|---------|---------|--------------|--------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0.3          | 0      |\n| 2       | 0       | 0.4          | 0.1    |\n| 3       | 0       | 0.2          | 0      |\n| 4       | 0       | 0.4          | 0.1    |\n| 5       | 0       | 0.3          | 0      |\n\n**Note:** All scores are consistent with the code's nature — a standard, benign setup script with superficial obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No evidence of malware, backdoors, or security risks. The obfuscation appears superficial and does not impact security.",
