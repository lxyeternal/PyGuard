{
  "purpose": "This code defines the package metadata and dependencies for a Python module using setuptools, serving as a setup script for distribution.",
  "sources": "Static data within the script, including variable assignments and the setup() call, with no external or untrusted input sources.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function consumes the configuration data; no untrusted data flows or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the obfuscated variables into the setup() function parameters, with no dynamic or external data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names that do not impact functionality but hinder readability; no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard 'setup.py' script for packaging a Python module, with superficial obfuscation via variable names. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input is present. The obfuscation appears intended solely for concealment, not malicious purposes. All security and malware scores are consistent with a benign package configuration. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard package setup with superficial obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks. The obfuscation does not impact security and appears to be for minimal concealment only.",
