  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'q37nze98j5s3l1hq' Python module, including dependency management.",
  "sources": "Reading the module list, dependency list, and metadata from the variables and the setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is used; the script primarily defines package configuration.",
  "flows": "Variables holding package info are passed directly to setup(), with no external data input or processing.",
  "anomalies": "Use of seemingly obfuscated variable names; no user input handling or dynamic code execution; the code appears intentionally minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script utilizing setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and configuration. Variables with obfuscated names hold package info and dependencies. The setup() function is called with these variables, typical for packaging. No code injection, malicious behavior, or suspicious activity is present. The obfuscation appears intentional for obscurity rather than malicious intent. No external input handling, code execution, or network activity detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign setup configuration file with obfuscated variable names. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The use of variable obfuscation is notable but not suspicious in this context.",
