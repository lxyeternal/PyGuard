{
  "purpose": "Define and configure a Python package setup for a package named 'q37nze98j5s3l1hq' that provides weighted quantile functions based on numpy.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata and dependencies from hardcoded strings and variables, specifically the package name, version, description, author info, URL, and required dependencies.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function writes package configuration files and installs dependencies, but no direct sinks like network connections or data exfiltration are present.",
  "flows": "Metadata and dependency variables are passed into setup(), which then processes and installs the package based on this configuration. No untrusted data flow or external communication occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The variable names are nonsensical and obfuscated, which may suggest an attempt to conceal purpose. The code itself is straightforward and typical for a setup script, with no evident malicious logic, backdoors, or hidden behavior. The code is minimal and appears benign.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package, using obfuscated variable names. It imports 'setuptools', defines package metadata and dependencies, then calls setup() with this info. There are no dynamic code executions, external network calls, or suspicious operations. The obfuscated variable names are unusual but not malicious. No secrets, credentials, or backdoors are present. The code's simplicity and directness suggest no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with obfuscated variable names but no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It appears to be a benign configuration for publishing a Python package.",
