{
  "purpose": "This code appears to implement a statistical or data processing function involving sorting, cumulative sums, and interpolation, likely for data analysis or machine learning purposes.",
  "sources": "Data inputs are read from function arguments GbewywVgKROfBHQHugkGElKgQVvMXBOv and lteqphYgpjvioAObLHoCczPwAAqJNRDV, which can be arrays or matrices.",
  "sinks": "The code does not explicitly write to files, send data over the network, or access sensitive system resources. No clear data leak or malicious sink is present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arguments through sorting, cumulative sum calculations, and interpolation functions, with no external untrusted data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secret keys are present. The variable names are nonsensical, but that alone is not malicious. The code uses mathematical operations without external calls that could be malicious. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides a statistical function that sorts input data, computes cumulative sums, normalizes data, and interpolates values based on a quantile parameter. The functions handle multidimensional inputs by reshaping and applying the same processing across axes, indicating standard data processing logic. No network, file I/O, or system modification commands are present. All operations are mathematical and in-memory.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate data processing utility, with no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The nonsensical variable names do not indicate obfuscation or malicious intent but suggest possible auto-generation or obfuscation avoidance. No security risks or malicious activity are detected based on this code fragment.",
