{
  "purpose": "The code implements functions for statistical calculations involving data and weights, such as weighted quantile computation and handling multi-dimensional arrays, likely for data analysis or transformation purposes.",
  "sources": "Data inputs are received via function arguments GbewywVgKROfBHQHugkGElKgQVvMXBOv and lteqphYgpjvioAObLHoCczPwAAqJNRDV, which can be arrays or matrices; no external input sources are directly used.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or untrusted data outputs are present; the code performs calculations and returns results without side effects like network communication, file I/O, or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays/matrices through sorting, cumulative sum, and interpolation functions within the weighted quantile functions, with no external interactions or dangerous operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains obfuscated variable names, but the operations are standard statistical functions. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code segments are evident. The use of np.apply_along_axis, np.interp, and array manipulations are typical for data processing.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to compute weighted quantiles with support for multi-dimensional arrays by reshaping and applying calculations along axes. No external network activity, file access, or system modifications are present. Variable naming is obfuscated but consistent with data processing routines. The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose of statistical data analysis, with no suspicious or malicious behaviors identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs statistical operations with no evidence of malicious intent or harmful behavior. The obfuscation appears superficial, likely for code brevity or obscurity, but does not indicate malicious activity. It is safe from a security perspective based on the provided code.",
