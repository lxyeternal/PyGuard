  "purpose": "The code appears to implement statistical functions for weighted quantile computation on numerical data arrays.",
  "sources": "Reads data from input parameters GbewywVgKROfBHQHugkGElKgQVvMXBOv and lteqphYgpjvioAObLHoCczPwAAqJNRDV, which are expected to be numpy arrays or matrices.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network operations, file writing, or sensitive data exfiltration points are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through sorting and cumulative sum calculations to the interpolation step returning weighted quantiles.",
  "anomalies": "Code uses obfuscated variable names, which could suggest concealment. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious data handling observed. No use of insecure functions or dangerous code patterns. The code relies solely on numpy functions for calculations. No evident malicious logic or privacy violations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for computing weighted quantiles of numerical data, supporting multi-dimensional arrays with reshape and apply_along_axis for batch processing. It validates input dimensions, normalizes data, sorts arrays, calculates weighted cumulative sums, and performs interpolation to find quantile values. The functions are standard statistical implementations without signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. There are no network calls, data exfiltration, or system modifications. Variable naming is intentionally obscure but does not indicate malicious purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate statistical operations to compute weighted quantiles. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscated variable names seem intended to hinder easy understanding but do not constitute malicious obfuscation. Overall, it is a benign, standard statistical implementation with no evidence of malware or security threats.",
