{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform statistical operations on numerical data, specifically calculating a weighted percentile, likely for data analysis or processing tasks.",
  "sources": "Data is read from function parameters GbewywVgKROfBHQHugkGElKgQVvMXBOv and lteqphYgpjvioAObLHoCczPwAAqJNRDV, which are expected to be numpy arrays or matrices.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks of untrusted data or malicious actions are present; the functions process data and return results without external communications or side effects.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through sorting and cumulative sum calculations in TEWfCkQaJIFmKVfLBeOCMEryeYAZrybX, then interpolation occurs based on a specified quantile, returning a processed value.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses obfuscated variable names, which can be a sign of concealment. It employs reshape and apply_along_axis for multi-dimensional input handling, but no obvious malicious behavior is evident. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious external calls are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple functions that handle numpy arrays/matrices, performing sorting, cumulative sums, and interpolation to compute weighted percentiles. The functions handle multi-dimensional inputs by reshaping, and process data in a way consistent with statistical analysis routines. No evidence of data exfiltration, external network access, or malicious commands is found. The variable names are deliberately obfuscated, but this alone does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code appears to be a utility for statistical data processing.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a data processing utility for weighted percentiles, with obfuscated variable names. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious side effects. The code's obfuscation raises some suspicion, but functionality alone is benign.",
