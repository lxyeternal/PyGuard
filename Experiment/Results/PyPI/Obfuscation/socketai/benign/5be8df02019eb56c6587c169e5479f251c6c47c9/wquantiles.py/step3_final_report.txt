{
  "purpose": "The code implements weighted quantile calculations on numpy arrays or matrices, supporting multi-dimensional data processing.",
  "sources": "Reads input data arrays (GbewywVgKROfBHQHugkGElKgQVvMXBOv) and weight arrays (lteqphYgpjvioAObLHoCczPwAAqJNRDV).",
  "sinks": "No external data or network activity; data remains within memory during sorting, cumulative sum, and interpolation.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays through sorting, cumulative sum, normalization, and interpolation to produce weighted quantile outputs.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are obfuscated, but the code uses standard numpy routines without suspicious patterns or external dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard weighted quantile calculations, including input validation, sorting, cumulative sum, normalization, and interpolation. Obfuscated variable names suggest superficial obfuscation but do not indicate malicious intent. No external I/O, network activity, or data leaks are present. The functions support multi-dimensional data by reshaping as needed. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are detected. The obfuscation is superficial, and the logic aligns with legitimate statistical processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of weighted quantile functions with superficial obfuscation. No malicious activity or security threats are evident. The obfuscation does not serve malicious purposes but may hinder readability. Overall, the code is safe for use in data processing contexts.",
