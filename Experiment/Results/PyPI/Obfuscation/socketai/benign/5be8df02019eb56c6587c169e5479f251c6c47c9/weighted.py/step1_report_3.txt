{
  "purpose": "This code issues a deprecation warning about a module and then imports all functions from the 'wquantiles' library.",
  "sources": "The warning function 'warn' and the import statement 'from wquantiles import *'.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of imported functions from 'wquantiles' could be a sink if they process untrusted data, but no specific sink is directly evident in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The warning function 'warn' is called with a message, then 'del warn' deletes the warning function. The import statement imports everything from 'wquantiles'.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' can be considered unusual as it may hide imported function sources, but it is not inherently malicious. The code does not contain obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code issues a deprecation warning to inform users about the module's status, then deletes the 'warn' function, likely to prevent further warnings. It then imports all contents from the 'wquantiles' library, which is common in scientific or statistical code. No suspicious activity such as data exfiltration, system modification, or malicious payloads is evident. The code appears to be a simple deprecation notice and module import, with standard Python practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign deprecation warning and imports a third-party library. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The use of 'import *' is not recommended but not malicious here.",
