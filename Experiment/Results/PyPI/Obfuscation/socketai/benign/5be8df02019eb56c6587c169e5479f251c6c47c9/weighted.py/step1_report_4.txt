{
  "purpose": "Issue a deprecation warning for the module and import all functions from the 'wquantiles' library.",
  "sources": "The 'warn' function from the 'warnings' module, and the import statement from 'wquantiles'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or user input are present.",
  "flows": "The warning is issued and then the 'wquantiles' library functions are imported into the namespace.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'del warn' to delete the 'warn' function after use is unusual but not malicious; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'warn' function, issues a deprecation warning about the module, then deletes the 'warn' function from the namespace. Subsequently, it imports all contents from the 'wquantiles' library. There is no evidence of malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation. The deletion of 'warn' may be seen as an attempt to clean up the namespace but does not pose security issues. The code's purpose appears to be to notify users of deprecation and then provide access to 'wquantiles' functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves to warn users about deprecation and imports 'wquantiles' functions. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
