{
  "purpose": "The code issues a deprecation warning about a module and then imports all contents from the 'wquantiles' library.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'warn' function from the 'warnings' module, and imports everything from 'wquantiles'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain explicit untrusted data sinks or outputs that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The warning message is generated from a hardcoded string, and the import statement loads external library contents into the namespace.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'del warn' to remove the warning function after issuing the warning is somewhat unusual but not malicious. The import * statement can lead to namespace pollution but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code issues a DeprecationWarning about the module being deprecated, then deletes the warn function from the namespace. It then imports all functions and variables from the 'wquantiles' library. No user input or untrusted data sources are involved. There are no indicators of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, network activity, or code injection. The use of 'import *' can be risky in terms of namespace pollution but is common in some scripts and not necessarily malicious. The code appears to be a standard deprecation notice with a library import, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a deprecation notice and importing a numerical library. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks present.",
