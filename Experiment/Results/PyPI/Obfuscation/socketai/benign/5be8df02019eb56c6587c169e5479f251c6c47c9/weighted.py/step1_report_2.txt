{
  "purpose": "The code issues a deprecation warning for a module and imports all functions from the 'wquantiles' library.",
  "sources": "The 'warn' function from the 'warnings' module, and the 'wquantiles' package",
  "sinks": "Potential use of imported functions from 'wquantiles' which could process untrusted data",
  "flows": "The warning is triggered upon execution; subsequent imported functions from 'wquantiles' can be used for data processing",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'del warn' to remove the warning function after issuing the warning is unusual but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code observed",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing 'warn' from 'warnings' and immediately issues a deprecation warning indicating the module is outdated and replaced by 'wquantiles'. The 'warn' function is then deleted to prevent further warnings from this source. Subsequently, all functions and classes from 'wquantiles' are imported via 'from wquantiles import *', which is generally discouraged due to namespace pollution but is not inherently malicious. The code's main function is to notify users of deprecation and then provide access to 'wquantiles' functionalities. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The removal of the warning function after use is unusual but does not introduce security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard deprecation notice with subsequent import of a library. It does not contain malicious behavior or supply chain risks. It simply informs users of deprecation and imports the replacement library. No suspicious activity or malware signals are present.",
