{
  "purpose": "Issue a deprecation warning about the module and import all functions from the wquantiles package.",
  "sources": "The 'warn' function from the 'warnings' module, and the entire 'wquantiles' package.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of imported functions from 'wquantiles' which may process data, but no specific sink is present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Warning issued via 'warn' source, then 'del warn' removes the 'warn' function; subsequent use of 'wquantiles' functions could process data.",
  "anomalies": "The explicit deletion of the 'warn' function after issuing a warning is unusual; however, this is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code issues a DeprecationWarning about the current module and suggests using 'wquantiles' instead. It then deletes the 'warn' function from memory, possibly to prevent further warnings or reduce namespace clutter. The import of all functions from 'wquantiles' could enable data processing but, in isolation, does not indicate malicious intent. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. The deletion of 'warn' is unconventional but not malicious; it might be for code cleanup or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code primarily serves to warn users about deprecation and imports a statistical library. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet. The deletion of 'warn' is unusual but not malicious. Overall, the code appears benign.",
