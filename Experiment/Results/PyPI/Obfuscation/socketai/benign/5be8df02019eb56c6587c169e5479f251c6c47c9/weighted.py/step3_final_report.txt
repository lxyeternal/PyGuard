{
  "purpose": "This code issues a deprecation warning about the module being outdated, then removes the warning function from the namespace, and imports all functions from the 'wquantiles' library.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the 'warnings' module to call 'warn', and imports from 'wquantiles'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, functions from 'wquantiles' could process untrusted data, but in isolation, no sink leads to data leakage or malicious activity.",
  "flows": "The warning is issued via 'warn', then 'warn' is deleted, and functions from 'wquantiles' are made available for use; no external data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The deletion of 'warn' after issuing the warning is unusual but not malicious; use of 'import *' can cause namespace pollution but is not inherently suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard deprecation warning, then removes the 'warn' function from the namespace, and imports all functions from 'wquantiles'. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The deletion of 'warn' is unconventional but benign. The use of 'import *' is discouraged but not malicious. No data leaks or network activity are involved. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a deprecation notice and library import with no malicious intent. The scores are appropriate; no modifications are necessary.",
