{
  "purpose": "A standard Python setup script defining package metadata and dependencies, with obfuscated variable names.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of package name, version, license, dependencies, and a file reading function; no external data or input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data leaks, network activity, or code execution beyond static configuration.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from sources to sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names ('QHXaayZAcfnBfrlkSMsSUlJqPvIUWCNy', 'HMzjTrVtMqUInBUxBuvfCQiSEaiwzNFz'), unused 'read' function, suspicious package name 'g9mpgcyzrwil5nkm'.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with obfuscated variable names and a nonsensical package name, which could be an attempt at concealment. No network activity, code injection, or malicious data handling is present. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not constitute malicious behavior. The variables are assigned but unused, indicating possible concealment or obfuscation. The dependency list and structure are standard. Overall, the code is benign but warrants caution due to obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with obfuscated variable names and a suspicious package name. No active malicious activity or malware is detected. The obfuscation alone is suspicious but not definitive of malicious intent. Scores are set accordingly: malware score 0, obfuscated score ~0.7, security risk ~0.2.",
