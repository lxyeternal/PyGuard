{
  "purpose": "The function processes a dictionary with various options for returning keys, values, or combined strings based on the provided type parameter, with optional string concatenation.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the 'mapping_' dictionary parameter and optional environment variables or external input indirectly through function parameters.",
  "sinks": "The function constructs and returns lists of strings, potentially combining data with user-defined prefixes or suffixes, but does not write to files, execute commands, or send data externally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the input dictionary through key-value processing, with optional string manipulations and concatenations based on the 'typ' parameter, with no external system interaction.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses obfuscated function and variable names, minimal comments, and includes string concatenations with fixed parameters; no clear malicious activity or backdoors are evident. The string splitting and joining seem unnecessary but benign.",
  "analysis": "The function appears to be a utility for extracting and formatting dictionary data based on input parameters. It performs string manipulations and conditional returns, with no indications of malicious code such as network communication, data exfiltration, or system modification. The obfuscation seems to be an attempt to hide intent but does not inherently indicate malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic are evident. The structure suggests code that could be used in various contexts but by itself does not contain malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily a data processing utility with obfuscated identifiers. No malicious or maliciously intended actions are evident, and it appears to be safe. The obfuscation and minimal context do not suggest malicious intent, but the code could be part of a larger, potentially suspicious system depending on how it is used.",
