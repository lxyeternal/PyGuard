{
  "purpose": "The code imports two modules with obfuscated class/variable names, likely part of a larger codebase or obfuscation pattern.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .onehotdummy_class and .mapping_to_colname",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, network activity, or external data sinks are present",
  "flows": "N/A; only import statements, no data flow or execution logic",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated module and class names, which could suggest obfuscation or auto-generation but not necessarily malicious",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two import statements from local modules with obfuscated names. No executable code, data flow, or network activity is present. The obfuscation could be auto-generated or intended to conceal purpose but does not inherently indicate malicious intent. Malware and security risk scores are appropriately low, with high obfuscation scores justified by the nonsensical identifiers. No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities are evident from this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting only of obfuscated import statements. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. The high obfuscation score is justified but does not imply malicious intent. No further action is necessary based solely on this snippet.",
