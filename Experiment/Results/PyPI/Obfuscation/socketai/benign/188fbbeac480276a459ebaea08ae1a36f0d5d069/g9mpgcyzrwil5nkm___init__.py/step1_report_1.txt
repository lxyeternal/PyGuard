  "purpose": "Import classes or functions from local modules, likely for further processing or functionality within a package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from relative modules: .onehotdummy_class and .mapping_to_colname",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data output or untrusted data handling in the provided snippet",
  "flows": "No data flow beyond import statements; no processing or data handling observed",
  "anomalies": "Imports are from local modules with obfuscated or non-descriptive names; no other anomalies detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two import statements importing classes or variables with obfuscated names from local modules. There is no executable code, no data input, and no suspicious behavior visible. The obfuscated naming may suggest an attempt to hide the purpose, but without additional context or code, this is not inherently malicious. No malware-like behavior, hardcoded credentials, or malicious actions are evident in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is limited to import statements with obfuscated identifiers. There is no malicious behavior or security risk apparent from these lines alone. The code appears to be part of a larger package, but on its own, it does not pose any security threat.",
