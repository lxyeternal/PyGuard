  "purpose": "Import classes from relative modules, likely for use in a larger package or application.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing classes from local modules.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; simply imports classes.",
  "anomalies": "Class names appear obfuscated or auto-generated, which could be suspicious, but this alone isn't conclusive. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from relative modules with obfuscated class names. No function calls, data processing, or dynamic execution present. The class names suggest obfuscation but are not inherently malicious. No evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activities. The code does not perform any operations that could indicate malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code only performs straightforward imports from local modules, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The obfuscated class names are a common pattern in auto-generated code but do not imply malicious behavior in this context.",
