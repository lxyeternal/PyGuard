{
  "purpose": "The code imports classes or functions from two local modules, likely for internal use within a larger Python project.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .onehotdummy_class and .mapping_to_colname",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, no sinks that process untrusted data or perform sensitive actions are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; only import statements without further data processing or flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "Imports use highly obfuscated-looking module and class/function names, which could be an attempt to hide malicious intent or obscure functionality. No other suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two import statements from local modules with obfuscated names. There are no visible operations, data handling, or network activity. Obfuscated names may suggest an attempt to hide malicious code, but based solely on these import statements, no malicious activity or security risk is directly observable.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet alone does not contain malicious behavior; it is a straightforward import of potentially internal components with obfuscated names. Further context would be needed to assess overall risk, but no immediate signs of malware or security issues are evident.",
