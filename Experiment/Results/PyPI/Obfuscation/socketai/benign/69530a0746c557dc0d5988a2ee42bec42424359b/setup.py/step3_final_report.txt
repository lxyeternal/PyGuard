  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, handling file reading and version extraction.",
  "sources": "File reading via open() in read(), regex search for version string in file content.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, network activity, or system modifications detected.",
  "flows": "read() function reads file content; regex extracts version; setup() uses metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated variable and function names; regex pattern for version extraction; no clear comments.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated identifiers. It reads files, extracts version info via regex, and configures package metadata. No network, system modifications, or malicious payloads are present. Obfuscation may be to hinder reverse engineering but does not indicate malicious intent. The regex pattern searches for a specific assignment line, typical in version management. The dependencies are standard, and no suspicious data handling or code injection is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, obfuscated setup script with no signs of malware or malicious activity. The obfuscation raises suspicion but is not evidence of malicious intent. The overall security risk is low.",
