  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated and dynamically manipulates request attributes, which could be exploited maliciously. However, there is no direct evidence of malware or malicious intent. The current security assessment should assign a low malware score (~0.2), a high obfuscation score (~0.7), and a moderate risk (~0.4). Further investigation into the imported utility function is recommended to confirm its behavior."
