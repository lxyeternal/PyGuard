  "sinks": "The return statement joining the string representations of the tuple elements",
  "flows": "Reading from the tuple and converting each element to string, then joining into a single string",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names, no user input or external data, simple string joining logic",
  "analysis": "The code defines a tuple with three integers. It then defines a function that converts each integer to a string and joins them with periods. There is no input handling, external data reading, or suspicious logic. Variable names appear obfuscated but are not inherently malicious. The code simply creates and returns a string of numbers separated by dots.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a straightforward operation of joining predefined integers into a string. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security issues. The obfuscated variable names are a potential sign of obfuscation but do not indicate malicious intent.",
