{
  "purpose": "The code handles report export functionality within a Django application, generating files in formats like CSV and XLS/XLSX based on request parameters and serving them as HTTP responses.",
  "sources": "Request GET parameters for filename and format, class attributes, external functions for report processing.",
  "sinks": "HttpResponse object with content and headers, including dynamic filenames and content types.",
  "flows": "Input parameters from request.GET flow into filename construction, content type selection, and external function calls, ultimately leading to the HTTP response serving the report file.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of variable and function names, dynamic attribute access, reliance on external functions (e.g., 'PWBVHkDItbroNwttJjNRnoPBBQBWPRxK') whose behavior is unknown, potential for input manipulation via request parameters.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a report export utility with obfuscated code to hinder static analysis. No explicit malicious code, network activity, or data exfiltration is evident. External dependencies and dynamic attribute/method calls pose potential risks if malicious, but no direct evidence is present. The obfuscation is significant but does not inherently indicate malicious intent. The request parameters used for filenames and formats could be exploited if not sanitized, warranting caution. Overall, the logic aligns with standard report serving functions, with obfuscation and external calls being the main points of concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a report generation and export utility with obfuscation techniques. No malicious activity is evident from the provided snippets. External dependencies and dynamic method calls could be exploited if malicious, but no direct evidence is present. The risk and malware scores are appropriately low, with obfuscation justified by the code structure. Further review of external functions and input sanitization is recommended before deployment.",
