  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a report generation and export utility with obfuscation techniques. No malicious activity is evident from the provided snippets. External dependencies and dynamic method calls could be exploited if malicious, but no direct evidence is present. The risk and malware scores are appropriately low, with obfuscation justified by the code structure. Further review of external functions and input sanitization is recommended before deployment."
