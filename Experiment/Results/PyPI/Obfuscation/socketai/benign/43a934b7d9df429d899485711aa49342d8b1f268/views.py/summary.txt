  "conclusion": "The code is an obfuscated Django view that relies on external modules/functions with unclear behavior. While no direct malicious activity is evident, the obfuscation and external calls warrant further investigation. The malware score is estimated at 0.2, reflecting low suspicion but acknowledging potential risk. The obfuscation score is high (~0.75), and the overall security risk is moderate (~0.4). It is recommended to review the external modules' implementations to confirm their behavior before deployment."
