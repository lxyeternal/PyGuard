  "purpose": "Analyze the provided obfuscated Django class-based view code for potential malicious behavior, focusing on external dependencies, obfuscation, and data handling patterns.",
  "sources": "get_table_class(), get_table_data(), external functions paCEYOmxLuggwahxXYBVJMqTdRysMBop and egqJrlfcJqkEDuLQVfabzQqkdAepIZrV, self.request, self.get_table_pagination()",
  "sinks": "External functions invoked with data and request, potential data exfiltration or covert processing, dynamic attribute assignment",
  "flows": "Data retrieved via get_table_data() flows into external functions and table construction; external functions may process or transmit data; pagination info flows into external functions",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of class, method, and variable names; external functions with non-descriptive names; version check for Python >= 1.8.0; indirect external calls; no explicit malicious actions but high obfuscation red flags",
  "analysis": "The code is a Django class-based view that constructs a table with optional pagination, invoking external functions with obfuscated names. No direct malicious activity such as network connections, file operations, or credential handling is visible. The external functions' implementations are unknown, raising suspicion that they could perform covert operations or data exfiltration. The obfuscation level is high, with nonsensical names, which is often used to hide malicious intent but can also be for proprietary reasons. Version checks are standard, and the overall logic appears consistent with legitimate data presentation. Given the lack of concrete malicious actions, the code's suspicious nature is primarily due to obfuscation and external dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is an obfuscated Django view that relies on external modules/functions with unclear behavior. While no direct malicious activity is evident, the obfuscation and external calls warrant further investigation. The malware score is estimated at 0.2, reflecting low suspicion but acknowledging potential risk. The obfuscation score is high (~0.75), and the overall security risk is moderate (~0.4). It is recommended to review the external modules' implementations to confirm their behavior before deployment.",
