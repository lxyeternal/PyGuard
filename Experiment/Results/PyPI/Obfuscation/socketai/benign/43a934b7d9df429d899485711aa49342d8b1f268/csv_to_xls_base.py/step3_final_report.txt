  "purpose": "Utility function to extract an attribute (default 'content') from an object, decode it if bytes (Python 3), remove null bytes, and wrap in StringIO for in-memory string handling.",
  "sources": "Attribute of an input object (e.g., 'content'), potentially untrusted data",
  "sinks": "Creating a StringIO object from the processed data",
  "flows": "Read attribute -> decode if bytes -> replace null bytes -> wrap in StringIO",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated variable and function names; no comments or documentation; no external system interactions",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward data extraction and sanitization, with version-aware imports and handling. No malicious code, network activity, or system modifications are present. Obfuscation suggests an attempt to hide purpose but does not imply malicious intent. The null byte removal is a benign sanitization step. Scores assigned in reports (malware=0, risk=0.1-0.2, obfuscated=0.7-0.8) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility with obfuscated naming, no malicious behavior, and minimal security risk. Obfuscation warrants caution but does not indicate malicious intent. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
