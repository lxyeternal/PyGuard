  "purpose": "Utility module for exporting data to Excel files, selecting the appropriate library dynamically based on environment and user preference.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as sheet name, data content, and optional library choice; environment detection via import attempts.",
  "sinks": "Delegates data to external library functions for Excel file creation; no network or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into validation, library selection, and then into the delegated conversion functions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names; superficial obfuscation without malicious intent; no suspicious code or hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code validates sheet name length, dynamically imports one of several Excel libraries based on availability or user input, and delegates data processing to the selected converter. No network activity, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code is present. Obfuscation appears superficial, likely for concealment, but does not indicate malicious intent. The dynamic import pattern is standard for optional dependencies. No suspicious data flows or system calls are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for Excel file generation supporting multiple libraries. No signs of malware or malicious behavior are evident. Obfuscation is superficial and does not contribute to security risks. The overall security risk is minimal.",
