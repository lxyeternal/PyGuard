  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for testing data export functionalities in Django applications. Despite superficial obfuscation, there is no evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or supply chain sabotage. The malware score is correctly assigned as 0, and the obfuscation and risk scores are justified by the code's structure and purpose."
