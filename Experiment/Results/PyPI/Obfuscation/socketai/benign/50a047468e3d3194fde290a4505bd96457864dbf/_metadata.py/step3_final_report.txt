  "purpose": "Setup for Objective-C messaging/chat plugin, registering method signatures and defining related data structures.",
  "sources": "Constants, system info (sys.maxsize, objc.arch), and static string constants.",
  "sinks": "Method registration functions that could potentially be invoked with malicious input if not validated externally.",
  "flows": "Constants and system info flow into method signature registration via objc.registerMetaDataForSelector.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function names, extensive dynamic registration, and use of string constants that seem to serve concealment.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs environment detection, defines data types, and registers Objective-C method signatures dynamically. Obfuscated function names and string constants suggest an attempt to conceal intent but do not indicate malicious activity. No network, file, or data exfiltration is evident. The setup appears typical for a plugin or extension, with obfuscation possibly for reverse engineering resistance. No active malicious payloads or suspicious data flows are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a configuration/setup routine for an Objective-C messaging plugin. Obfuscation is notable but not malicious. The low malware score aligns with the absence of malicious activity, while the high obfuscation score reflects the concealment efforts. Overall, the security risk remains low, primarily due to obfuscation and extensive method registration, which could be misused if invoked maliciously, but no such activity is observed.",
