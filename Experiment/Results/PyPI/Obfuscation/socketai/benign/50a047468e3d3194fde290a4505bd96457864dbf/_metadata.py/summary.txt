  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a configuration/setup routine for an Objective-C messaging plugin. Obfuscation is notable but not malicious. The low malware score aligns with the absence of malicious activity, while the high obfuscation score reflects the concealment efforts. Overall, the security risk remains low, primarily due to obfuscation and extensive method registration, which could be misused if invoked maliciously, but no such activity is observed."
