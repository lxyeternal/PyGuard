  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate macOS plugin/framework loader with obfuscation tactics. There is no evidence of malware or malicious activity. The current security scores are appropriate; the malware score should remain at 0, with moderate obfuscation and low security risk. Monitoring in broader context is advised but no immediate concern exists."
