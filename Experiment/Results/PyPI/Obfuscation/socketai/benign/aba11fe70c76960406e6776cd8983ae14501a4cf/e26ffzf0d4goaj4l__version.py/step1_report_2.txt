{
  "purpose": "Define version information and a type alias for version tuples based on a conditional flag.",
  "sources": "The code reads the value of the variable 'teNTtHFVRQzjlIbwjGGEXcHmqxLIZilM' to determine the type alias and sets version variables directly.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or untrusted data flows; no external data processing or output occurs.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: based on the boolean flag, either assign a tuple type or a generic object, then assign version strings and tuples.",
  "anomalies": "The boolean variable 'teNTtHFVRQzjlIbwjGGEXcHmqxLIZilM' appears to control type aliasing but is hardcoded to False, making the conditional redundant. No secrets, credentials, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally defines a type alias depending on a hardcoded boolean value. It then assigns version information both as strings and tuples. No input sources, no untrusted data handling, and no dangerous operations are present. The conditional is redundant but not malicious. There are no suspicious behaviors or obfuscated code elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign; it simply manages version information with a conditional type alias that is hardcoded to avoid complexity. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation detected.",
