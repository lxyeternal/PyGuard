  "purpose": "Define version information and conditional type annotations based on a flag.",
  "sources": "The variable teNTtHFVRQzjlIbwjGGEXcHmqxLIZilM as a boolean flag; assignment of version string and tuple.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no data leaks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "The flag controls whether type annotations are imported and assigned, but no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a non-descriptive boolean flag to conditionally import typing and assign type annotations; the flag name appears arbitrary and possibly obfuscated.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a boolean variable with a seemingly random name set to False. If True, it imports Tuple and Union from typing and defines a type alias; if False, assigns a generic object. It then assigns version and version_tuple variables to static version data. No user input, network access, or dynamic code execution is present. No hardcoded credentials or malicious logic are detected. The code's obfuscation is minimal; the variable names are obscure but not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple configuration snippet with obfuscated variable names, no malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks. It does not perform any harmful actions or contain malicious payloads.",
