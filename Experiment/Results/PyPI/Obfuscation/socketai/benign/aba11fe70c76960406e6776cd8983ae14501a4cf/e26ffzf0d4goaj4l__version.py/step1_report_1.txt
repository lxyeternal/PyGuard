{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define version information for a package or module, using conditional logic to assign types and values based on a boolean flag.",
  "sources": "The source of data is the hardcoded string '0.1.3' assigned to 'version', which is then used to create a version tuple.",
  "sinks": "The code assigns the version string and tuple to variables but does not include any data leaks or external data flows.",
  "flows": "The version string is converted into a tuple and assigned to variables, with no external input or output flows.",
  "anomalies": "The boolean flag 'teNTtHFVRQzjlIbwjGGEXcHmqxLIZilM' is set to False, making the conditional branch inactive; variable names are obfuscated and verbose, which is unusual but not malicious. No dynamic code execution, network access, or sensitive data handling is present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a boolean flag which is set to False, leading to the assignment of 'object' type to 'ACjuQAewzaIYQnZmQAtEUhCMiGgCokEa'. When the flag is False, it skips importing modules and assigns the version string '0.1.3' to 'version' and 'version_tuple', converting the string into a tuple. There are no input sources from external data or untrusted sources. No sinks, such as network, file, or environment variable access, are present. The code's purpose appears to be version management, and it contains no obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, primarily defining version info with obfuscated variable names but no malicious activity or security risks detected. It does not perform any external data handling or malicious actions.",
