{
  "purpose": "Define version information with optional type annotation based on a flag",
  "sources": "The code reads the value of teNTtHFVRQzjlIbwjGGEXcHmqxLIZilM to determine type annotations; assigns version and version_tuple variables",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or potential data leaks",
  "flows": "The flag determines whether type annotations are set as Tuple or object, but no data flow to external systems",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names and a conditional import pattern; no clear malicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports typing constructs and assigns version info to variables. No external inputs or untrusted data sources are involved. The obfuscated variable names do not indicate malicious intent but suggest code concealment. No data is sent, stored insecurely, or used in a harmful manner.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to serve as a version annotation setup with obfuscated naming but contains no malicious or security-risk behavior. It does not perform any malicious actions or data leaks.",
