  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the claims, and determine appropriate scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports focus on a single import statement:\n  ```python\n  from .qt_console import aRehiXxieauwsHNAdkTioLCxeikJWjDe\n  ```\n- The imported symbol's name is highly obfuscated, which is suspicious but not inherently malicious.\n- No additional code or context is provided; therefore, assessments are limited to this snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Import a specific function/class with an obfuscated name.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior detected; only a minimal import statement.\n- **Confidence:** 0.3\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.7\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\n**Comments:** The low malware score aligns with the absence of evidence of malicious activity. The obfuscation level is high, justifying the concern but not confirming malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** Similar conclusion; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Confidence:** 0.6\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.7\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\n**Comments:** Slightly higher confidence, but still no evidence of malicious behavior. The high obfuscation warrants caution but isn't conclusive.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** Same reasoning; the obfuscated name could be benign or malicious.\n- **Confidence:** 0.7\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.8\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\n**Comments:** The confidence is higher, but the malware score remains zero, which is appropriate given the information.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** The report notes suspicion due to obfuscation but finds no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** 0.5\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.7\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\n**Comments:** The reasoning is consistent; the obfuscation is suspicious but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** The high obfuscation and suspicion of concealment are noted; however, no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** 0.4\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.8\n- **Malware:** 0.2\n- **Risk:** 0.3\n\n**Comments:** The malware score is slightly elevated (0.2) due to the obfuscation, which is reasonable but still not conclusive. The confidence level is moderate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Recommendations:\n\n- **Code verification:** The import statement itself is syntactically correct and only involves importing a symbol from a local module. No malicious code or network activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscation:** The highly obfuscated name is suspicious but not definitive proof of malicious intent.\n- **Malware score:** Remains at 0 in most reports, which is appropriate given the limited context.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly elevated due to obfuscation but not high.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — No evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.8 — The symbol name is highly obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — Slight concern due to obfuscation but no confirmed threat.\n\n**Note:** If further context reveals how this symbol is used, the scores might need adjustment. For now, the current scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion:**\n- The code snippet is minimal and syntactically correct.\n- The obfuscated name warrants caution but does not confirm malicious intent.\n- Scores are consistent with the evidence provided.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.8\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nFurther review of the actual `qt_console` module and usage of `aRehiXxieauwsHNAdkTioLCxeikJWjDe` is necessary to refine these assessments.",
