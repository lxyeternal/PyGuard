  "conclusion": "The code snippet is a minimal, syntactically correct import with a highly obfuscated symbol name. There is no evidence of malicious activity based solely on this snippet. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware and risk scores should remain low unless additional context reveals malicious behavior."
