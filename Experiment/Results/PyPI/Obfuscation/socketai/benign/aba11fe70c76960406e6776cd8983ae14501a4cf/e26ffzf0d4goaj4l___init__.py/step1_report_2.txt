{
  "purpose": "Import a specific object (aRehiXxieauwsHNAdkTioLCxeikJWjDe) from a local module named qt_console.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data flows or could cause harm.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink is present.",
  "anomalies": "The imported symbol has a highly obfuscated or random-looking name, which may be suspicious, but this alone is not conclusive. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple relative import statement, importing a single object from a module within the package. The imported object's name appears obfuscated or randomly generated, which could suggest malicious intent or an attempt to evade detection. However, the code does not include any malicious actions, network activity, or data manipulation. It is a minimal, syntactically correct import statement with no evident malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with an obfuscated object name. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this fragment. The obfuscated name alone is not sufficient to conclude malicious intent but warrants caution if found in suspicious packages.",
