{
  "purpose": "Import a symbol with an obfuscated name from a local module, likely for internal use or concealment.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no external data sources or inputs are involved.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external effects are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only performs a static import.",
  "anomalies": "The symbol name 'aRehiXxieauwsHNAdkTioLCxeikJWjDe' is highly obfuscated, which could indicate concealment or malicious intent, but no malicious activity is evident in this minimal code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement importing an obfuscated symbol from a local module. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not demonstrate malicious behavior such as network activity, code execution, or data exfiltration. The scores across reports appropriately reflect high obfuscation (0.7-0.8), low malware likelihood (0-0.2), and low security risk (0.2-0.3). Given the limited context, the overall assessment is that this code is benign but warrants further review of the module contents to confirm the purpose of the imported symbol.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is a minimal, syntactically correct import with a highly obfuscated symbol name. There is no evidence of malicious activity based solely on this snippet. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware and risk scores should remain low unless additional context reveals malicious behavior.",
