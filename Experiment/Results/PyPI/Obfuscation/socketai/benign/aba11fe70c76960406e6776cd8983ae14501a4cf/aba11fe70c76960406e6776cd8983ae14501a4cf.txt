      "conclusion": "The import statement alone is not malicious but uses an obfuscated symbol name, which warrants caution. The low malware score aligns with the absence of direct malicious activity, while the high obfuscation score indicates suspicion. Overall, the code appears benign but should be reviewed in the context of the full project to rule out hidden malicious intent."

      "conclusion": "The code snippet is a minimal, syntactically correct import with a highly obfuscated symbol name. There is no evidence of malicious activity based solely on this snippet. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware and risk scores should remain low unless additional context reveals malicious behavior."

      "conclusion": "The code in reports 3 and 5 demonstrates high malicious potential due to obfuscation, dynamic execution, and network activity, warranting high malware and risk scores. Reports 1, 2, and 4 are benign or non-functional, justifying low scores. Overall, the assessments are consistent and justified, with no need for score adjustments."
