  "conclusion": "The import statement alone is not malicious but uses an obfuscated symbol name, which warrants caution. The low malware score aligns with the absence of direct malicious activity, while the high obfuscation score indicates suspicion. Overall, the code appears benign but should be reviewed in the context of the full project to rule out hidden malicious intent."
