  "purpose": "Import a specific object 'aRehiXxieauwsHNAdkTioLCxeikJWjDe' from the module '.qt_console'.",
  "sources": "Import statement reading from a local module '.qt_console'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "The import loads a potentially obfuscated or intentionally named attribute from a module.",
  "anomalies": "The imported attribute name 'aRehiXxieauwsHNAdkTioLCxeikJWjDe' appears to be a nonsensical or obfuscated string, which could be suspicious. The module name '.qt_console' may relate to a console or debugging tool, but alone it is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple import from a relative module. The imported attribute's name is complex and possibly obfuscated, which could indicate malicious intent or an attempt to hide malicious behavior. There are no other suspicious constructs, such as hardcoded credentials, network calls, or dynamic execution. Since this is only an import statement, the risk is limited, but the obfuscated attribute name warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement, but the unusual attribute name raises some suspicion about obfuscation or hidden functionality. No direct malicious activity is evident, but the context of the attribute's use could be a concern.",
