  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code snippet:\n\nOriginal Code:\n```python\nfrom .qt_console import aRehiXxieauwsHNAdkTioLCxeikJWjDe\n```\n\n**Summary of the reports:**\n- All reports agree that the import statement is from a local module `.qt_console`.\n- The imported symbol `aRehiXxieauwsHNAdkTioLCxeikJWjDe` appears obfuscated or randomly generated.\n- No additional code, data flows, or suspicious behaviors are present in the snippet.\n- The main concern is the obfuscated name, which could suggest malicious intent or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Is the reported issue present?**  \n  Yes. The import statement is present and matches all reports.\n\n- **Are there errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No. The code is syntactically correct. The only \"issue\" is the obfuscated symbol name, which is not an error but a pattern worth scrutinizing.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation of the scores:\n\n#### Obfuscated:\n- All reports assign high obfuscation scores (around 0.7-0.8).  \n- This seems reasonable given the nonsensical, long string name.\n\n#### Malware:\n- Report scores range from 0.1 to 0.3, with some indicating very low suspicion.  \n- Since this is only an import statement with an obfuscated name, **malware suspicion should be low but not zero**—perhaps around **0.2** seems appropriate, considering obfuscation alone can be used maliciously.\n\n#### Security Risk:\n- The reports' scores are mostly low (0.2-0.4).  \n- Given the minimal context, this is reasonable. The risk is limited unless further code reveals malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n- **Is there any evidence of malicious activity?**  \n  No. The snippet alone does not show malicious actions, data exfiltration, network calls, or code execution.\n\n- **Are the claims about obfuscation justified?**  \n  Yes. The name is clearly obfuscated or generated, which warrants caution but is not definitive evidence of malicious intent.\n\n- **Are the risk scores reasonable?**  \n  They are consistent with the suspicion level. The highest malware score (0.3) is acceptable, but perhaps slightly high given no other malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Overall malware score:** 0.2 (slightly increased from some reports, but still low).\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.8 (consistent with the reports).\n- **Risk score:** 0.3 (moderate, reflecting suspicion but no direct evidence).\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n- The code is a simple import statement with an obfuscated symbol name.\n- No direct malicious activity is evident.\n- The obfuscation pattern warrants caution, but without further context, the risk remains low.\n- The scores should be:\n  - **Malware:** **0.2**\n  - **Obfuscated:** **0.8**\n  - **Risk:** **0.3**\n\n**Further investigation should include examining the contents of `qt_console` and how `aRehiXxieauwsHNAdkTioLCxeikJWjDe` is used elsewhere in the codebase.**",
