  "purpose": "Import a specific function or class named 'aRehiXxieauwsHNAdkTioLCxeikJWjDe' from the module 'qt_console' within the same package.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing from a local module within the package",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or external communication",
  "flows": "Import statement retrieves a function/class from a local module; no data flow analysis needed beyond import",
  "anomalies": "The imported name 'aRehiXxieauwsHNAdkTioLCxeikJWjDe' appears obfuscated or randomly generated, which is suspicious. No other code or context provided.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a single import statement from a local module. The imported symbol has a nonsensical, obfuscated name, suggesting it may be intentionally hidden or malicious. Without additional context or usage, it's unclear if this is malicious. The pattern of the name could indicate obfuscation or an attempt to conceal functionality, possibly malicious. There are no other indicators of malicious behavior or external communication in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal but the obfuscated import name raises suspicion of potential obfuscation or malicious intent. With only this line, it is not definitive but warrants caution due to the unusual naming pattern.",
