{
  "purpose": "Import a specific object with an obfuscated or randomly generated name from a local module 'qt_console'.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no data input or external sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows are present in this code snippet; no untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "N/A — only an import statement with no further code to analyze for source-to-sink flows.",
  "anomalies": "The object name 'aRehiXxieauwsHNAdkTioLCxeikJWjDe' appears obfuscated or randomly generated, which is suspicious but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement importing an obfuscated symbol from a local module. The obfuscated name raises suspicion of concealment but does not demonstrate malicious behavior on its own. Malware scores are low (~0.2), reflecting the lack of evidence for malicious activity. Obfuscation scores are high (~0.8), appropriately indicating suspicion. Risk scores are low (~0.3), consistent with the minimal context and absence of malicious actions. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions suggest no immediate threat, but the obfuscation warrants further review if part of a larger suspicious codebase.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement alone is not malicious but uses an obfuscated symbol name, which warrants caution. The low malware score aligns with the absence of direct malicious activity, while the high obfuscation score indicates suspicion. Overall, the code appears benign but should be reviewed in the context of the full project to rule out hidden malicious intent.",
