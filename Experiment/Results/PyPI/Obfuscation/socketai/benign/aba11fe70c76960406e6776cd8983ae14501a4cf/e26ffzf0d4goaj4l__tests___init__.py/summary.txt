  "obfuscated": 0.8,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code in reports 3 and 5 demonstrates high malicious potential due to obfuscation, dynamic execution, and network activity, warranting high malware and risk scores. Reports 1, 2, and 4 are benign or non-functional, justifying low scores. Overall, the assessments are consistent and justified, with no need for score adjustments."
