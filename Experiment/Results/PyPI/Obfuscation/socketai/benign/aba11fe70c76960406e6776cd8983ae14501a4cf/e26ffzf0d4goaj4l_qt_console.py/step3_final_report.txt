{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom widget for napari/IPython to manage themes and kernel interactions, primarily for UI styling and environment handling.",
  "sources": "Reads theme data, environment globals, IPython shell types, caller frame info, and color strings.",
  "sinks": "Updates theme styling, manages kernel channels, shuts down kernels, and modifies UI focus.",
  "flows": "Theme data and environment globals flow into styling and kernel management functions; no network or payload activity observed.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, complex import structure, dynamic kernel handling, caller frame inspection, no hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a sophisticated UI widget that manages themes and kernel sessions, with complex import and variable naming patterns. No network activity, payloads, or data exfiltration are present. Obfuscation appears to serve complexity concealment rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, complex UI component for napari/IPython integration, with no evidence of malicious behavior or payloads. The obfuscation is notable but not malicious. The overall security risk is low.",
