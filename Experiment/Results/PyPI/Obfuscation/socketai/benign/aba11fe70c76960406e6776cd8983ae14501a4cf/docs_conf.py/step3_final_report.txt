  "purpose": "Static configuration data for documentation or plugin setup, primarily for Sphinx.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded strings, lists, and dictionaries within the code; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; no data flows to external systems or files.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow; static assignment of configuration variables.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names that do not follow standard naming conventions; no malicious code or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static data declarations with obfuscated variable names, likely auto-generated or intentionally obscured. There are no functions, input handling, network activity, or code execution. The obfuscation appears to be stylistic or for code generation purposes, not malicious. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or system modification are evident. The malware score is appropriately zero, and the security risk is minimal due to the static, benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign configuration data with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security threats. The high obfuscation score reflects variable naming but does not imply malicious activity. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use.",
