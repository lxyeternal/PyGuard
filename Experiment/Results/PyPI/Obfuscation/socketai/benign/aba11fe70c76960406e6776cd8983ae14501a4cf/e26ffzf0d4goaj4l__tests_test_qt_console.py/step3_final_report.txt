{
  "purpose": "The code comprises pytest unit tests for napari_console, involving widget interactions, environment setup, and mock patching of get_ipython.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from environment variables, widget states, and internal variables within the test functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks or effects could occur at widget state manipulations, environment variable modifications, or network communications, but none are evident here.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables and internal test setup into widget states and internal variables, with no external data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, dynamic patching of functions, manipulation of internal widget and global variables, and environment modifications are present but typical in testing contexts.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of testing routines using mocking, environment patching, and widget interactions. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are detected. Obfuscation is high but consistent with testing practices. The code does not perform any harmful actions or system modifications outside the test scope.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign testing code with obfuscation, no malicious behavior, and minimal security risk. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is moderate to high (~0.6), and overall security risk is low (~0.2). The assessments in the reports are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.6,
