  "purpose": "Define parameters for a MicroPython or CircuitPython firmware configuration, including device info and available emitters.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: gRghMmoOiIkGMZPafPfRGyjxxXqxMBRh, version, platform, emitters.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; the code primarily declares parameters without executing or handling untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are assigned but not processed in a way that leads untrusted data to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated or intentionally scrambled variable names; no clear purpose or standard structure. The description uses unusual wording and formatting. No actual executable logic present; the code appears to be a docstring or a commented section, not functional code.",
  "analysis": "The provided snippet is a parameter documentation block, likely extracted from a function or class. It contains variable descriptions with obfuscated names and stylized text. There are no control flows, data processing, or operations that could indicate malicious activity. The obfuscation appears intentional but does not result in malicious behavior. No external data handling, input/output, or suspicious code is observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a descriptive parameter block, not executable logic. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The obfuscation seems stylistic rather than malicious. Overall, the code appears safe.",
