{
  "purpose": "The code defines several type alias declarations with heavily obfuscated variable names, serving primarily as type hints or internal code organization without runtime logic.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input, environment variables, or data sources; it only declares type aliases.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects, as the code contains only type alias declarations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code does not process or transfer data at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "The variable names are intentionally obfuscated, which could hinder readability but does not indicate malicious intent. No other anomalies are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and type alias definitions with obscure variable names. There are no functions, data processing, or external interactions. The obfuscation is stylistic or for internal concealment, not malicious. No signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection, are evident. The high obfuscation score (around 0.8) is justified by the variable naming but does not imply malicious intent. The malware score remains at 0, and the security risk score is 0, indicating no security threat. Confidence in this assessment is high (around 0.9), given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as type alias declarations with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation is stylistic and does not compromise security.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.8,
