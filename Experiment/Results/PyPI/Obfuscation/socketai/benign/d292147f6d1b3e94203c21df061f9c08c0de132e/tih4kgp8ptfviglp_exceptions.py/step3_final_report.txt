{
  "purpose": "The code defines multiple obfuscated exception classes with static string attributes, with no functional logic or external interactions.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and static string assignments within each class.",
  "sinks": "No data flows, external calls, or data handling present.",
  "flows": "None; the code contains only class declarations with static variables.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names, but no active malicious behavior or code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of obfuscated exception class definitions with static strings, lacking any logic, data flow, or external interactions. The obfuscation suggests concealment but does not indicate malicious intent in isolation. No signs of data exfiltration, malicious payloads, or system manipulation are evident. The high obfuscation score is justified, but the absence of active behavior warrants a low malware and security risk score.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as obfuscated class definitions without malicious activity. The high obfuscation is noted but does not imply malicious intent. The low malware and risk scores are appropriate, and the overall assessment indicates minimal security concern.",
