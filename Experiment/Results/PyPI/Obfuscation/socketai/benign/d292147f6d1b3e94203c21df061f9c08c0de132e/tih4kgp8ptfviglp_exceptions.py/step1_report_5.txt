{
  "purpose": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes, each inheriting from a base exception class, with hardcoded string attributes.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and class attribute assignments containing hardcoded string values.",
  "sinks": "No apparent data sinks; no input/output functions or network operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code solely defines classes and static attributes.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of multiple classes with seemingly random class names and string values; no functional logic or data handling. No code executes outside class definitions. No dynamic code execution, input reading, or data transmission detected.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains class definitions with hardcoded string attributes. There are no functions, data processing, or operations that process external input. The class names and attribute values appear obfuscated or randomly generated, which can be a sign of attempts to hide malicious intent. However, without actual data handling, network calls, or other suspicious operations, this appears to be either placeholder code, obfuscation, or benign code designed to mislead. No malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, system modification, or malicious payloads, is evident in this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists solely of class definitions with static attributes; no malicious behavior or security threats are apparent. The obfuscated naming could be suspicious, but there is no evidence of malicious activity within this snippet.",
