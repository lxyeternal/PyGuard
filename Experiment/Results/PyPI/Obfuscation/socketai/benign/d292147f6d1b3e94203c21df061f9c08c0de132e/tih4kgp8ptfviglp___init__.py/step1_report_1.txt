{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script, potentially for data processing or utility functions. No explicit purpose can be determined due to lack of context or comments.",
  "sources": "Reads data from environment variables, possibly from user input or system environment. Uses imported modules, which may load external data or dependencies.",
  "sinks": "Uses print statements and possibly writes to files or network if such code exists beyond the visible snippet. No direct suspicious sinks are identified in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Data is fetched from environment variables or user input and processed through functions, but no clear flow from untrusted source to sensitive sink is observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No obfuscation or unusual language features present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with standard library usage. No signs of malicious activity such as network connections, data exfiltration, or code injection. The absence of comments or context limits full analysis, but nothing suspicious is evident in the visible parts.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign with standard practices. Confidence in this assessment is high, given the limited code and lack of suspicious elements.",
