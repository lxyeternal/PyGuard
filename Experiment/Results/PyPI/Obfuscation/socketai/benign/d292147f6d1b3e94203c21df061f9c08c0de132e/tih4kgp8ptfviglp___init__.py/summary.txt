  "conclusion": "The dependency appears benign in most cases, with Report 3 indicating moderate malicious potential due to dynamic code execution and obfuscation tactics. Slightly increasing the malware score for Report 3 to 0.5 and the overall security risk to 0.65 would better reflect the observed suspicious behaviors. No other adjustments are necessary."
