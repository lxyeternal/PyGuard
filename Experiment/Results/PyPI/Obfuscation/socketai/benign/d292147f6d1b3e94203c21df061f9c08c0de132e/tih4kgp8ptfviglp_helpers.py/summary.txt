  "conclusion": "The analyzed code snippets are predominantly benign with some obfuscation and dynamic features that could conceal malicious intent. No concrete malicious payloads are present, and the security risk remains low. The scores are consistent with the observed patterns, suggesting a cautious but generally safe profile. Continued vigilance is recommended, especially for code with high obfuscation or dynamic execution."
