  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a standard Python script performing some data processing or utility functions. No explicit malicious intent is evident from the structure and comments.",
  "sources": "Input is read from function parameters, environment variables, or standard input; no external or untrusted sources are directly accessed or loaded.",
  "sinks": "Data is written to variables, files, or output functions; no suspicious network connections, system modifications, or data exfiltration points are observed.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through processing functions and is outputted or stored locally; no paths lead to network or system-level effects involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual dynamic code execution present. The code is straightforward without obfuscated parts. No hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code was examined for common security issues such as injection points, data leaks, environment variable misuse, and suspicious network activity. No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or sabotage were identified. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard and justified. The overall structure indicates a benign utility script with no anomalous or malicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. The code appears safe with no significant security risks. Confidence is high that this code is benign.",
