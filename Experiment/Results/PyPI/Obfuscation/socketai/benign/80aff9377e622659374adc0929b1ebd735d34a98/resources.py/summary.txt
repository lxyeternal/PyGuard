  "conclusion": "The code is a standard SSH utility with configurable security options. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The main concern is the potential for insecure configurations (e.g., disabling host key verification), which should be used cautiously. Overall, it is a legitimate component with known security caveats, not malicious."
