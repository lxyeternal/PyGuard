{
  "purpose": "Assigns a version string \"0.26.12\" to an obfuscated variable, likely for version tracking or configuration.",
  "sources": "No external inputs, environment variables, or data sources; static assignment.",
  "sinks": "None; no data leaks, network activity, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Single source (hardcoded string) to variable; no data flow beyond assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable name; no dynamic code, no suspicious patterns, no malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward static assignment of a version string to an obfuscated variable name. No external inputs, outputs, or network activity are present. The variable name appears obfuscated but this alone does not imply malicious intent. The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation score is moderate, reflecting the variable name, but does not indicate malicious activity. Malware score is zero, and security risk is minimal. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features justify a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static assignment of a version string to an obfuscated variable name. There is no malicious behavior or security threat present. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
