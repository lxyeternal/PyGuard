  "purpose": "Assigns a version string to a variable, likely indicating package or software version.",
  "sources": "The right-hand side string '0.26.12' assigned to the variable.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or sensitive operations detected.",
  "flows": "The string value flows into the variable 'xqZdIVRTDphXkzAOgUGZEkbAPVNEetra'.",
  "anomalies": "The variable name appears to be a random, obfuscated string, but no malicious code or behavior is evident. The assignment is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to an obfuscated variable name. There are no inputs, outputs, or suspicious behaviors. The variable name does not match common patterns, suggesting obfuscation, but it does not imply malicious intent. No harmful code, network activity, or credential access is present. No code injection, data leakage, or security flaws are observable.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply stores a version string into a seemingly obfuscated variable. No malicious or security-risk behavior is evident.",
