  "purpose": "Assign a version string to a variable, likely for package versioning or configuration.",
  "sources": "Assignment statement reading a hardcoded string.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data input or output.",
  "flows": "None, as it's a simple static assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single variable assignment where a string '0.26.12' is stored in a variable named 'xqZdIVRTDphXkzAOgUGZEkbAPVNEetra'. The variable name appears randomly generated, but that alone does not indicate malicious intent. There are no dynamic code executions, input/output operations, or obfuscated code segments. The assignment is static and straightforward, typical for version identifiers.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple variable assignment of a version string with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
