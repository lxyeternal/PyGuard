  "flows": "No data flow beyond variable assignment; no source-to-sink flow present",
  "anomalies": "Variable name appears obfuscated or randomly generated; no clear purpose or context; minimal code, no processing or control flow",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to a variable with an unusual name. There are no external inputs, no data processing, no network or file operations. The variable name appears obfuscated, but this alone does not indicate malicious intent. The code fragment is minimal and contains no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code simply assigns a version string to a variable with an obfuscated name. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign.",
