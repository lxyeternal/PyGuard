  "purpose": "Registering a version of 'dagster-ssh' with the DagsterLibraryRegistry using obfuscated variable names.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'dagster_shared.libraries', 'dagster_ssh.resources', and 'dagster_ssh.version'; registration call with obfuscated version variable.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows; no network or file operations present.",
  "flows": "Import statements → registration call with obfuscated version variable.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated variable names for imported resources and version, which is unusual and suspicious but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward imports and registers a library version with the registry. The variable names are obfuscated, which could be an attempt to conceal details, but no malicious activity such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code injection is evident. The registration pattern is standard. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. The malware score is set to 0, the obfuscated score is high (~0.7), reflecting suspicion, and the security risk score is low (~0.2). The overall assessment is that the code appears benign but warrants cautious review due to obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical plugin registration with obfuscated identifiers. No evidence of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities is present. The high obfuscation score warrants attention, but the low malware and risk scores suggest the code is likely legitimate. Further context on the origin of the obfuscated variables would be beneficial for a definitive assessment.",
