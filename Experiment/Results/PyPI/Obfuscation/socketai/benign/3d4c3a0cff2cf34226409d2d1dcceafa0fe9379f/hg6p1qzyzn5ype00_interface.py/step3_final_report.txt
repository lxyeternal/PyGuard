{
  "purpose": "The code defines two classes with methods that raise NotImplementedError, serving as placeholders or abstract classes with obfuscated names. There is no active logic, data handling, or malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and method declarations; no data input/output or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows present; no external communication or data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; methods are unimplemented and do not execute logic.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names; no active code or logic; methods raise NotImplementedError.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of placeholder class definitions with obfuscated names and methods that raise NotImplementedError. No active behavior, data flow, or external interactions are present. The obfuscation may be suspicious but is not inherently malicious. The absence of malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious activity aligns with a malware score of 0. The obfuscated naming warrants a moderate obfuscation score (~0.7), but overall security risk remains very low (~0.0). The reasoning in the reports correctly interprets the code as benign placeholders, and the scores are consistent with this assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as placeholder or abstract classes with obfuscated names. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscation score around 0.7, and security risk score near 0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
