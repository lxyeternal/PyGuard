{
  "purpose": "This code defines two classes with methods that are placeholders raising NotImplementedError, likely intended as abstract base classes or interface definitions.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and method declarations with no input or data reading occurring within the code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, no data leaks, or external communication present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink, as the code does not process data or perform any operations.",
  "anomalies": "Class and method names appear obfuscated, but there are no signs of malicious actions such as hidden network calls, credential handling, or malicious code logic. The code is minimal and structurally simple.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two classes with method stubs that raise NotImplementedError. There are no data inputs, no data processing, and no external interactions. The obfuscated names could be an attempt to hide purpose, but structurally, it resembles placeholder or abstract class definitions. No suspicious behaviors or malware patterns are evident. The code appears benign and possibly incomplete or intentionally abstract.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated malicious intent. The code is minimal and seems to serve as a structural placeholder without active logic.",
