{
  "purpose": "The code defines two classes with method stubs that raise NotImplementedError, indicating they are placeholders or abstract methods.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and method declarations with no data input or external data sources",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs; no data processing, network communication, or file operations",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink as the code contains only method stubs with no implementations",
  "anomalies": "Class names and method names are obfuscated and do not follow meaningful naming conventions; no actual logic or data handling present",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two classes each with a single method that raises NotImplementedError. There is no data processing, no external data input, no logic, and no network or file operations. The naming appears intentionally obfuscated, which could be suspicious; however, the absence of executable logic suggests this is either a placeholder, abstract base classes, or incomplete code. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be placeholder or abstract class definitions with obfuscated names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks in this snippet. The obfuscation alone does not imply malicious intent but warrants caution if part of a larger, obscured codebase.",
