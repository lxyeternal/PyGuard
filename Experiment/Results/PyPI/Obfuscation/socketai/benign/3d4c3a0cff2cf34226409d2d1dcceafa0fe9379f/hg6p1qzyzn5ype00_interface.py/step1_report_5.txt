{
  "purpose": "The code defines two classes with method stubs that raise NotImplementedError, serving as placeholders or abstract methods.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data output, file writing, network connections, or other sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths exist, as the code contains only class definitions with unimplemented methods.",
  "anomalies": "Class names and method names are obfuscated and do not convey meaningful functionality. No actual logic or data handling is present. No secrets, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two classes with uniquely named methods that raise NotImplementedError. These are typical for abstract base classes or interface definitions. There are no input sources, no data processing, and no output or network activities. The obfuscated naming might suggest an attempt to hide intent, but without actual implementation or behavior, there is no evidence of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be placeholder or abstract class definitions with obfuscated names, lacking any operational or malicious code. No security risks or malware are evident from this fragment.",
