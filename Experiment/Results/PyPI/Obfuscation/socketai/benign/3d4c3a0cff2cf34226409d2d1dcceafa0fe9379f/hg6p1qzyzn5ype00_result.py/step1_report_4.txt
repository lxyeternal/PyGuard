  "purpose": "The code defines classes for manipulating and visualizing causal graphs, with functionalities for permutation, data handling, and visualization using Graphviz.",
  "sources": "Input data for matrices and labels via property setters; random color generation in ExiEihWUZsRJRSiYkPOCJMiuzhhKAPjJ function.",
  "sinks": "Graph visualization rendering; use of random color code; no direct data leak or untrusted input affecting system directly.",
  "flows": "Data is set via properties, permuted, then visualized in Graphviz rendering; random color generator used during visualization.",
  "anomalies": "Use of random color generation for node styling; code does not include obvious hardcoded secrets or backdoors. No external network communication or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to implement classes for graph manipulation and visualization with permutation logic and data handling. The use of random color generation for visualization is benign. No input is read from external sources during runtime; data is assigned via properties. The code relies on external libraries (numpy, graphviz), which are standard and not suspicious. No obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or hidden backdoors detected. Visualization functions generate graph images and do not perform network operations. The permutation logic involves matrix manipulations, but nothing indicates malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be intended for causal graph visualization and data permutation. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. The use of random color generation is for aesthetic purposes only. Overall, this code is benign with respect to supply chain or malicious activity.",
