      "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration with obfuscated variable names and a bug in subprocess invocation. It does not contain malicious behavior but should be corrected for proper operation. The security risk is minimal, but obfuscation and incorrect subprocess usage warrant caution."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only to define custom exception classes with obfuscated names. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The high obfuscation score is justified by the class names, but malware and security risk scores should remain low. Overall, the code is harmless in isolation."

      "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign, consisting only of obfuscated import statements with no evidence of malicious activity. The high obfuscation warrants cautious monitoring, but based solely on this fragment, the security risk is minimal. The scores assigned are consistent with the analysis, and no immediate threat is identified."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate visualization and data permutation utility with obfuscation. There is no evidence of malware, malicious sabotage, or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation is likely for proprietary concealment rather than malicious intent. Overall security risk is low."

      "conclusion": "The code is a complex, obfuscated statistical modeling toolkit with no evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. The heavy obfuscation may serve to protect proprietary algorithms or reduce readability but does not indicate malicious intent. The low malware and risk scores are justified, and the overall assessment is that the code is legitimate for data analysis purposes."

The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscation score around 0.7, and security risk score near 0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
