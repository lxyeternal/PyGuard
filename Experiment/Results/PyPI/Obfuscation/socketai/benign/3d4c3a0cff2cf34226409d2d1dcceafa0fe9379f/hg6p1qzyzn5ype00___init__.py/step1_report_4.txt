  "sources": "Import statements from 'causalmodels.lingam' and 'causalmodels.result' modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; purely static imports.",
  "anomalies": "Import identifiers are obfuscated or nonsensical, which could suggest intentional concealment or obfuscation; no meaningful variable names or documentation provided.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static imports from a library named 'causalmodels' with non-descriptive, seemingly random class or function names. There are no data input, processing, or output operations. The obscurity of identifiers may indicate attempts to hide the purpose of imported components but does not directly imply malicious intent. Since the code contains only import statements without any further logic, the actual behavior depends on how these imported components are used elsewhere. No malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code execution, or network communication is evident within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet consists solely of import statements with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security risks within this code segment. The obscure naming could be suspicious, but without further context, it does not constitute malicious behavior.",
