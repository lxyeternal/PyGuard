{
  "purpose": "Import specific classes or functions from modules within the 'causalmodels' package, likely for causal inference tasks.",
  "sources": "Import statements reading modules 'causalmodels.lingam' and 'causalmodels.result'.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data inputs or sinks detected; imports are static and do not process external data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks observed; code only imports modules and symbols.",
  "anomalies": "The imported class and function names appear to be obfuscated or nonsensical, which could indicate an attempt to hide malicious intent or obfuscation. No other unusual code present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two import statements with obfuscated or nonsensical symbol names. These import statements do not perform any data processing, network activity, or system modifications. The unusual naming could be benign obfuscation or malicious concealment. No malicious behavior or security risks are directly observable from these lines alone. The lack of further code limits assessment of behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code only imports two sets of classes/functions with obfuscated names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks based on these lines alone. The obfuscated names warrant caution but do not confirm malicious intent.",
