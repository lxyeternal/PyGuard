  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling, likely for use in a larger application.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources; no data reading operations present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as data output, network connections, or file writes present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths within the code.",
  "anomalies": "The class names are obfuscated with seemingly random strings, which is unusual and can be a sign of malicious intent or an attempt to hide purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code declares two exception classes, one inheriting from the built-in Exception and the other inheriting from the first class. Both class names are highly obfuscated, which could be suspicious. However, the code itself only defines class structures without any functional logic, input/output operations, or side effects. The obfuscated class names might be used for concealment but do not in themselves indicate malicious behavior. No evidence of malicious activity, such as network access, data exfiltration, or backdoors, is present within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists solely of class definitions with obfuscated names, which could be a sign of code hiding or obfuscation. There is no direct evidence of malicious intent or security risks within this small snippet. The obfuscation warrants cautious review in a broader context but is not, by itself, malicious.",
