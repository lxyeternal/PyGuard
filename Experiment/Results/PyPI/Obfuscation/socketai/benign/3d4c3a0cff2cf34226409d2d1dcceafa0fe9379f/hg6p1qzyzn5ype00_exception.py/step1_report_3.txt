{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling or specific exception identification",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading present in this code",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points; no untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flow, input, or output in the code",
  "anomalies": "Use of non-descriptive, obfuscated class names; no other suspicious activity",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two class definitions inheriting from Python's Exception class. The class names appear obfuscated or auto-generated. There is no logic, data handling, or external interaction present. No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious behaviors, and no malicious code structures are evident. The purpose seems to be defining custom exception types, possibly for use elsewhere.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal, benign snippet defining custom exception classes with obfuscated names. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or malware. It appears to be a harmless part of larger codebase, possibly auto-generated or obfuscated intentionally.",
