  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only to define custom exception classes with obfuscated names. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The high obfuscation score is justified by the class names, but malware and security risk scores should remain low. Overall, the code is harmless in isolation."
