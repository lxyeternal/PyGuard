{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes, likely for specialized error handling within a larger application or library.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and inheritance from Exception, which is standard in Python.",
  "sinks": "No external data or untrusted input handling, no data leaks, no system modifications.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input or external systems; only class inheritance structures.",
  "anomalies": "Use of non-meaningful, obfuscated class names; no apparent functionality or code logic beyond class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code contains two class definitions, both inheriting from Exception or its subclass. The class names are intentionally obfuscated and do not suggest any malicious activity or data handling. There are no functions, data processing, input/output operations, or external interactions. The purpose seems solely to create custom exception types with opaque names, which could be used in larger code but are not inherently malicious or suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code only defines two custom exception classes with obfuscated names, without any malicious behavior or security risks apparent. The code appears to be benign, possibly part of a larger obfuscated or intentionally obscure codebase, but in isolation, it presents no malicious or security concerns.",
