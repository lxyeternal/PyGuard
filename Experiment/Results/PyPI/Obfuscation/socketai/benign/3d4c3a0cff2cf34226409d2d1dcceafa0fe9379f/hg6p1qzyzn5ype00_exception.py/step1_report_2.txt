{
  "purpose": "The code defines two custom exception classes, likely intended for use as specific error types within a larger application.",
  "sources": "Class definitions; no input reading or data processing present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows, as the code only defines exception classes with inheritance.",
  "anomalies": "The class names appear to be random or obfuscated, with no descriptive naming. No functional or security-related anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two custom exception classes with non-descriptive, seemingly random names. The second class inherits from the first, which in turn inherits from the built-in Exception class. There are no data inputs, no processing, no potential data leaks, and no suspicious behaviors such as network calls, file operations, or credential handling. The unusual class names suggest obfuscation but do not indicate malicious intent in isolation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and serves the purpose of custom exception definition. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The obfuscated class names are suspicious but do not inherently imply malicious intent; they could be for obfuscation or branding.",
