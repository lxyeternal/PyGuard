{
  "purpose": "Define two custom exception classes with obfuscated names, likely for use elsewhere in the codebase.",
  "sources": "Class definitions with obfuscated class names; no external data input/output or side effects.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only class inheritance hierarchy established.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class names, which could suggest concealment but do not in themselves indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two class definitions inheriting from Exception, with non-descriptive, obfuscated names. There are no data flows, external interactions, or logic that could be malicious. The high obfuscation score reflects the non-descriptive naming, but the malware score remains zero due to lack of malicious behavior. Security risk is minimal, consistent with benign exception class definitions. The code's purpose appears to be to define custom exceptions, possibly as part of a larger obfuscated codebase, but in isolation, it poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only to define custom exception classes with obfuscated names. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The high obfuscation score is justified by the class names, but malware and security risk scores should remain low. Overall, the code is harmless in isolation.",
