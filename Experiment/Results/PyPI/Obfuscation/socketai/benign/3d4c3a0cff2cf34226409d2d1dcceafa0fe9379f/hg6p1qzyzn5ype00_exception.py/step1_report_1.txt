  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling.",
  "sources": "No data input, environment variables, or external data sources are read.",
  "sinks": "No outputs, external connections, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or processing occurs; the code only defines classes.",
  "anomalies": "Classes are named with seemingly random strings; no meaningful identifiers or documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code creates two custom exception classes, one inheriting from the other. The class names appear obfuscated or randomly generated, with no apparent logic or functionality beyond class declaration. There are no operations, data handling, or external interactions. No suspicious behavior or malicious code, such as data exfiltration, network connections, or obfuscation techniques, is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal, defining two exception classes with non-descriptive names. It shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The unusual class names suggest obfuscation, but without additional context or code, this is not inherently malicious.",
