{
  "purpose": "Import marshmallow serialization library and custom models, and update boolean value mappings.",
  "sources": "Import statements from marshmallow and marshmallow_objects.models; reading the 'truthy' and 'falsy' class attributes.",
  "sinks": "Updating class attributes 'truthy' and 'falsy' with lists of strings; no external data sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Import modules -> access and modify 'truthy' and 'falsy' class attributes.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic update of boolean mappings could potentially be misused if input data is manipulated, but this is standard configuration. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and models, then updates the 'truthy' and 'falsy' mappings for Boolean fields within marshmallow's schema. This customization adjusts how string inputs are interpreted as boolean values, accommodating various representations. There are no signs of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The code's structure and purpose appear benign and related to configuration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard configuration snippet customizing boolean input parsing. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code's intent is to extend marshmallow's boolean interpretation, which is typical and safe.",
