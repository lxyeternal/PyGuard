  "conclusion": "While no explicit malware is embedded, the code's complex, obfuscated, and reflection-heavy design, combined with untrusted data processing, creates a substantial security risk. It could be exploited for code injection or remote code execution if misused. The overall malware likelihood is moderate to high, warranting caution."
