{
  "purpose": "The code dynamically imports all symbols from the 'rsmime' module and sets the module's documentation string and __all__ attribute accordingly.",
  "sources": "Import statement 'from .rsmime import *', accessing 'rsmime.__doc__', and 'rsmime.__all__' if it exists.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no untrusted data is used in a vulnerable manner or passed to sensitive functions.",
  "flows": "Import of all symbols from 'rsmime' (source) and setting module attributes based on 'rsmime' properties (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import 'import *' which can obscure the origin of imported symbols, but this alone is not malicious; no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard re-export pattern, importing everything from a local module 'rsmime' and assigning its docstring and '__all__' attribute to the current module. No input handling, network operations, or credential management is present. The use of 'import *' is generally discouraged for clarity, but it is not inherently malicious. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward re-export mechanism from the 'rsmime' module. It does not contain malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks. The overall security risk is minimal.",
