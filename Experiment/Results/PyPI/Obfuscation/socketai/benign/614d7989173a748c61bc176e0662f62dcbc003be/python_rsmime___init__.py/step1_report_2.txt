{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from the local module 'rsmime' and sets the module's docstring and export list based on 'rsmime'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .rsmime, access to rsmime.__doc__, hasattr(rsmime, \"__all__\"), and rsmime.__all__",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data is processed or output directly",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports and assigns attributes",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import (*) which can obscure imported symbols and potentially hide malicious code, but this alone is not malicious; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious constructs observed",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward import from a local module, assigns the module docstring to its own, and conditionally sets the __all__ attribute. There are no external data inputs, no network communication, and no manipulation of untrusted data. The use of wildcard import can be considered a bad practice but does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code is minimal, typical for package __init__.py files, and contains no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard module initializer that imports a submodule and re-exports its documentation and symbols. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected based on this fragment.",
