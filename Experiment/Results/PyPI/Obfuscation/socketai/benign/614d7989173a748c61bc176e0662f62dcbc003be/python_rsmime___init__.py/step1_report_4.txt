{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from the 'rsmime' module and sets the module documentation and '__all__' attribute if available.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing from the local 'rsmime' module; access to 'rsmime.__doc__' and 'rsmime.__all__'.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or output to external systems.",
  "flows": "Import from 'rsmime' -> assign '__doc__' and possibly '__all__' from 'rsmime'.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' which can obscure actual imported names, but this is common in __init__.py files; no suspicious code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical __init__.py pattern that re-exports contents from a submodule 'rsmime'. It assigns the module's documentation string and '__all__' list if available. No external data handling, network access, or code execution is present. No hardcoded credentials, malicious imports, or suspicious behavior are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module initializer that re-exports contents from a submodule. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified.",
