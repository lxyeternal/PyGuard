{
  "purpose": "Re-exporting symbols and documentation from the rsmime module for package initialization.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .rsmime, accessing rsmime.__doc__, checking for rsmime.__all__.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data flows.",
  "flows": "Import from .rsmime → assign __doc__ and possibly __all__.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from .rsmime import *', which can obscure symbols but is common in __init__.py files.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard re-export pattern, importing all symbols from a local module, then assigning its documentation and symbol list to the current module. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are evident. The use of 'import *' is discouraged but typical in package __init__.py files and does not imply malicious intent. The code is straightforward and safe, with minimal security risk primarily due to the import style.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard for module re-exporting, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The use of 'import *' introduces a minor risk but is acceptable in this context. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are appropriate.",
