{
  "purpose": "This code imports all public objects from the rsmime module and sets the module's docstring and __all__ attribute accordingly.",
  "sources": "Import statement 'from .rsmime import *', and access to 'rsmime.__doc__' and 'rsmime.__all__' attributes.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks of untrusted data or potential security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing the rsmime module to assigning its docstring and __all__ attribute to the current module.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' can be considered risky as it imports all symbols from rsmime, which could potentially include malicious or unintended code. However, in this context, it appears to be a standard import pattern for module re-exporting. No other anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple import of all objects from the 'rsmime' module, then assigns the module's documentation string to the current module's __doc__ attribute, and if available, copies the __all__ list from rsmime. There are no data flows involving untrusted input, no code injection, and no suspicious operations. The use of 'import *' could be considered a potential risk if rsmime contains malicious code, but in normal package design, this is a common pattern for re-exporting symbols.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, performing a re-export of the rsmime module's public API and documentation. There are no signs of malicious intent or security issues based solely on this fragment.",
