{
  "purpose": "Import all components from the rsmime module and set module documentation and export variables accordingly.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .rsmime",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; the code only performs imports and attribute checks",
  "flows": "Import from rsmime -> setting __doc__ and __all__ attributes",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code imports everything from a relative module named rsmime, then assigns its __doc__ attribute to the current module's __doc__. It also conditionally sets the __all__ attribute if present in rsmime. The structure is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, data leaks, or suspicious behavior. The use of __all__ and __doc__ is typical for package interface setup. There are no signs of malicious intent, malicious data handling, or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module wrapper that re-exports contents from rsmime and sets documentation attributes. There are no security risks, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation detected.",
