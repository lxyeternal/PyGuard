  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the logic, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Findings:** The code simply imports everything from `.rsmime`, assigns `__doc__`, and conditionally sets `__all__`. No anomalies, no malicious behavior, no obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (due to minimal risk from import practices).  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code is benign. The low security risk score is appropriate. No change needed.\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Findings:** Uses `from .rsmime import *`, which can be risky due to obscured symbols, but is common in `__init__.py` files. No malicious behavior observed.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (slightly higher due to `import *`, but still standard).  \n- **Assessment:** The analysis correctly notes the potential risk but concludes it's benign. The security risk score could be slightly increased to 0.2, but 0.1 remains reasonable.\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Findings:** Similar to previous, with `import *`, no suspicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.  \n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher risk score is justified given the use of `import *`, which can hide malicious symbols if present. The report's reasoning aligns with standard package patterns; no issues.\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Findings:** Same pattern, standard re-export code, no malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.0.  \n- **Assessment:** Correctly identified as low risk. No change needed.\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Findings:** Uses `from .rsmime import *`, no anomalies, no suspicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.  \n- **Assessment:** Appropriate. The use of `import *` is noted but not considered malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward module re-export pattern.\n- No malicious activity, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets.\n- The main concern is the use of `import *`, which is common in `__init__.py` files but can be risky if the imported module contains malicious code.\n\n### Final malware, obfuscated, and risk scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk:** Given the use of `import *`, a conservative estimate would be around 0.2, but since all reports treat it as standard practice and no malicious intent is detected, **0.2** is reasonable.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The code is benign, standard package re-export code.\n- The risk score could be slightly increased from 0.1 to 0.2 due to `import *`, but staying at 0.2 maintains a cautious stance.\n- Malware and obfuscation scores remain at 0.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis assessment aligns with the evidence and reasoning from all reports.",
