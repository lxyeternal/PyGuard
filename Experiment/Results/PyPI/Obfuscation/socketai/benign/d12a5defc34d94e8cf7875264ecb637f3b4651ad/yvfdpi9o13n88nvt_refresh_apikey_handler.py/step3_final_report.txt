  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Code snippets, code descriptions, absence of code, and analysis summaries.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, suspicious network connections, malicious code execution points, or obfuscated segments.",
  "flows": "Not explicitly detailed; inferred from code descriptions and analysis conclusions.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code or suspicious patterns; no obfuscation or malicious indicators detected.",
  "analysis": "All reports consistently indicate benign code with no malicious activity or obfuscation. Scores of malware and obfuscated are 0 across reports, with low risk scores (~0.1-0.2) justified by the benign assessments. Confidence levels vary but are generally appropriate given the limited or absent code content. No suspicious behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are identified. The evaluations are coherent and align with the provided summaries.",
  "conclusion": "The code is assessed as safe, with no evidence of malware or obfuscation. The low risk scores are justified, and the confidence levels are appropriate. Overall, the dependency appears benign, and no adjustments to the scores are necessary.",
