  "flows": "Input datetime objects → custom serialization method → string output",
  "anomalies": "Unusual class and method naming with obfuscated-looking identifiers; no standard class names; the use of try-except block around a simple isinstance check is redundant but not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of a JSONEncoder, with an unconventional name. The method sEztyuBSuJBRmMJixaQSFqjfPIcIpQrw attempts to serialize datetime objects by converting them to strings. The use of a try-except block around isinstance check is unnecessary, but it does not introduce malicious behavior. No input sources, external data handling, or suspicious code flow detected. The code appears to be a benign utility for custom JSON serialization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, albeit obfuscated, custom JSON encoder for serializing datetime objects. No malicious intent or security risks are evident. The obfuscation may hinder readability but does not indicate malicious behavior.",
