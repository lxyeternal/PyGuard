  "purpose": "Custom JSON encoder for serializing datetime objects to string representation.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; uses only imported modules and class methods.",
  "sinks": "Potential serialization method; no evident data leaks or untrusted data sinks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; primarily extends JSONEncoder with date handling.",
  "anomalies": "Class name appears obfuscated, but no malicious or suspicious behavior detected; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of JSONEncoder that serializes datetime objects to strings. The class name is intentionally obfuscated, but the functionality is benign. The method attempts to convert datetime objects to string format, with a fallback to the parent class method. No external data input, network activity, or malicious behavior is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign custom JSON encoder for datetime serialization with obfuscated class name but no malicious intent. No security risks or malware indicators are present.",
