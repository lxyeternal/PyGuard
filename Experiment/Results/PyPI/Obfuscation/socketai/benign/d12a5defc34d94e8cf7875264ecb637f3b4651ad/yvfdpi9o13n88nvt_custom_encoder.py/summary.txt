  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, purpose-specific JSON encoder extension for datetime serialization. Despite obfuscation, there is no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware remains at zero. The overall security risk is low, around 0.1-0.2, primarily due to obfuscation. No changes are necessary; the code should be monitored for obfuscation if part of a larger supply chain, but it does not currently pose a threat."
