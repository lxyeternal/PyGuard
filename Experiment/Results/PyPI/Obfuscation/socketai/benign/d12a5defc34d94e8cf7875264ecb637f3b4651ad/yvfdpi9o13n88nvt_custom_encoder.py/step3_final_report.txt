  "sources": "No external data sources; class handles objects passed to JSON serialization.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks; no external network or file operations.",
  "flows": "Input objects are checked for datetime type, converted to string, then passed to parent encoder.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names; redundant try-except block; missing import or definition of base class.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of JSONEncoder that serializes datetime objects as strings. The class name and method names are obfuscated, which could be suspicious but do not indicate malicious intent. The code is straightforward, with no external data handling, network activity, or malicious payloads. The missing import of the base class suggests incomplete code but not malicious behavior. The obfuscation is consistent across reports, and the core functionality is benign. The redundant try-except is stylistic and harmless. Overall, the code appears to be a benign utility with obfuscated naming, possibly for concealment but without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, purpose-specific JSON encoder extension for datetime serialization. Despite obfuscation, there is no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware remains at zero. The overall security risk is low, around 0.1-0.2, primarily due to obfuscation. No changes are necessary; the code should be monitored for obfuscation if part of a larger supply chain, but it does not currently pose a threat.",
