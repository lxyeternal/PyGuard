{
  "purpose": "The code imports the 'setuptools' library and executes its 'setup' function, typically used for packaging and distributing Python modules.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'setuptools' module from the environment during import.",
  "sinks": "The 'setup()' function may write to files or directories related to package distribution, but not directly to external data sources.",
  "flows": "Import of 'setuptools' → execution of 'setup()' method; no data flow from untrusted sources detected.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a single import and a function call with no arguments; no suspicious or unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard setup invocation for a Python package, which is a common and legitimate use case. There are no input sources, no suspicious code patterns, no dynamic execution, or data leaks present. It is a minimal and typical setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup invocation with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any suspicious actions and appears to be legitimate package setup code.",
