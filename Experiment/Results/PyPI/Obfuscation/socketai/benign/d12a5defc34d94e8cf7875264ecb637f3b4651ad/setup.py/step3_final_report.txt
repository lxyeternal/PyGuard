  "purpose": "Minimal invocation of setuptools.setup() for Python package configuration.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup()' with no arguments.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code performs a standard setup invocation.",
  "flows": "Import of 'setuptools' leads directly to calling 'setup()' without data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward, minimal setup script with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup()' with no arguments, a common pattern in Python packaging scripts. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The code is benign, standard, and does not perform any dynamic or network operations. All reports correctly identify this as a benign setup invocation, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0, with full confidence. No anomalies or suspicious signals are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Python packaging script with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. The assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
