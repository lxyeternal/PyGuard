  "purpose": "Define data models and response structures for an application, possibly related to notebook and job management.",
  "sources": "No apparent data input sources; primarily static data structures and data serialization definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs that handle untrusted input or external data streams.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; mainly data structure definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of highly obfuscated-looking class and variable names; extensive use of 'field' with 'xFLgLwWEOkwakCUMiSGVWoQoHDQvDwtP' pattern suggests potential obfuscation. No actual code execution, system calls, network activities, or credential handling detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of data class definitions for serializable models, many with unusual or non-descriptive naming conventions. These classes do not contain executable logic, input handling, or network operations. The use of dynamic date defaults and large class hierarchies appear to be for data representation purposes. The obfuscation of class names and fields could be an attempt to hide intent, but there is no active malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoor mechanisms present. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious external interactions are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a set of data structure definitions with obfuscated naming, lacking any executable or malicious code. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks based on the current analysis.",
