  "conclusion": "The analyzed code snippets and reports are generally consistent in their assessments. The scores reflect suspicion levels appropriately, with high suspicion justified in report 4 due to obfuscation and malicious patterns. No adjustments are necessary; the overall security posture is moderate, warranting cautious monitoring but no immediate rejection."
