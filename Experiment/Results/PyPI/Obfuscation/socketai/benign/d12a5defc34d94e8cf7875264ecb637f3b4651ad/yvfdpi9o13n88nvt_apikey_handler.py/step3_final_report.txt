{
  "purpose": "The code manages API key creation, retrieval, modification, and token handling through external API requests, with heavily obfuscated function and variable names, and logs sensitive data.",
  "sources": "JSON request bodies, request attributes, environment variables, imported variables, and external API responses.",
  "sinks": "External API calls via 'requests', logging of sensitive data, setting response data, and potential data leaks through logs.",
  "flows": "Input data (request bodies, attributes) flows into API request payloads, which are sent to external services; responses are logged and returned.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with nonsensical function and variable names, inconsistent and suspicious logging of secrets, undefined variables, duplicated or incomplete code segments, use of dynamic or obscure request functions.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation, insecure handling of secrets (logging API keys and responses), and suspicious function naming patterns. The use of dynamically generated function names and inconsistent variable references suggest attempts to conceal intent. No explicit malicious payloads such as data exfiltration or reverse shells are directly observed, but the pattern of secret handling, obfuscation, and poor security practices are red flags. The high obfuscation score (0.8) and malware likelihood (0.7) are justified based on these signs. The overall security risk score (0.75) reflects significant concern due to potential concealment of malicious activity and insecure data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows strong signs of obfuscation and insecure practices, with high suspicion of malicious intent or concealment. While no explicit malicious payloads are confirmed, the pattern warrants further detailed analysis and de-obfuscation before trusting or deploying this code in sensitive environments.",
