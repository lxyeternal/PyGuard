  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code snippet is purely a documentation comment or parameter annotation.\n   - No executable code, data processing, or data flows are present.\n   - No input/output operations, network interactions, or malicious payloads are evident.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the snippet is just documentation with no security implications.\n   - No logical errors or misconceptions are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - malware: 0\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n     - confidence: 1\n   - These scores are reasonable given the nature of the code snippet.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:\n   - Since all reports correctly identify no executable code or malicious behavior, a risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified.\n   - The scores are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score**:\n   - Correctly set to 0 in all reports.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities are made; all assessments are cautious and based solely on the provided snippet.\n   - This is appropriate.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis: all zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n\n**Final Evaluation**:\n- The code snippet is purely documentation with no executable logic.\n- There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Security risk score**: 0\n\n**Summary**:\nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. The snippet is benign, and the scoring reflects that. No changes are necessary.",
