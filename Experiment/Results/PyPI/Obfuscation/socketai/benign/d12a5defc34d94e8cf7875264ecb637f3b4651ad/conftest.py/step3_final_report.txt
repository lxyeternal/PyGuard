  "purpose": "Configure a Jupyter server extension for testing purposes within a pytest framework.",
  "sources": "The variable assignment to a string representing a module path; the fixture parameter (both obfuscated).",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or perform any data leaks or external actions.",
  "flows": "The fixture returns a static configuration dictionary; no data flows from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and parameter names that are unused and do not influence execution; superficial obfuscation without malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pytest, defines an obfuscated variable assigned a string indicating a module path, and creates a fixture returning a configuration dictionary to enable a Jupyter extension. The variable names are obfuscated but unused, and the code performs no network, file, or malicious operations. The obfuscation appears superficial, possibly stylistic, with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is zero, and the security risk is very low (~0.1-0.2). The obfuscation suspicion is moderate but not indicative of malicious intent, and the overall code is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration snippet with superficial obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security risk. The obfuscation alone does not justify high suspicion, and the code can be considered safe.",
