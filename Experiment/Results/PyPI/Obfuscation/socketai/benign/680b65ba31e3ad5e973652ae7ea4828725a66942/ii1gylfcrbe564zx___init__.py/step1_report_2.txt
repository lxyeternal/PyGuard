  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple Python script that imports standard modules and performs basic operations, with no obvious malicious intent.",
  "sources": "No external inputs or data sources are explicitly read; the code does not contain input() calls or external data fetches.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks such as network connections, file writes, or environment variable usages that could lead to data leaks or system modifications.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present; the code executes straightforward logic without data manipulation or transfer from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward with standard imports, variable assignments, and function calls. It does not include any dynamic code execution, network operations, or credential handling. The lack of external data sources or outputs suggests no malicious activity. Given the simplicity and transparency, it appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems benign and does not perform any harmful actions.",
