{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for general utility or data processing, but the exact purpose cannot be definitively determined without further context.",
  "sources": "Input functions or data reads (e.g., reading files, environment variables, network requests).",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive operations such as network communication, file writing, or executing system commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks, possibly through processing functions or data manipulation routines.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies detected; however, lack of comments or obfuscated code segments could mask malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed thoroughly, examining both the structure and content. No suspicious code, such as malicious network requests, system manipulation, or obfuscated segments, was found. Usage of third-party libraries seems typical, and there are no indications of backdoors or data exfiltration attempts. The absence of hardcoded credentials and the lack of dangerous system calls reduce concern. Due to limited context and the code’s benign appearance, the confidence level is moderate.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit signs of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage based on the provided snippet. It appears to be a standard utility module with no immediate security risks identified.",
  "confidence": 0.75,
  "obfuscated": 0,
