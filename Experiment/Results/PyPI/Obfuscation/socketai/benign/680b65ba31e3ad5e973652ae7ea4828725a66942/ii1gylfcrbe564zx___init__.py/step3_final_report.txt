  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code input/output points, external data reads, network connections, environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network transmissions, file modifications, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Sources to sinks, e.g., data read from input leading to network transmission or file write.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated code, suspicious variable names, incomplete segments, hardcoded secrets, unusual imports.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets are predominantly benign, straightforward, and transparent. Report 4 shows signs of obfuscation or incomplete code, raising suspicion but lacking concrete malicious activity. The other reports correctly identify minimal or no risks. The malware scores are mostly zero, with a slight increase in report 4 due to obfuscation suspicion. Security risks are low across all reports, aligning with their descriptions. The confidence levels are appropriate given the available information. Overall, the assessments are consistent and justified.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears safe with low malicious potential. Report 4 warrants cautious monitoring due to obfuscation suspicion but does not demonstrate definitive malicious behavior. The scores are generally appropriate; minor adjustments could be made to reflect the suspicion level in report 4, but current values are reasonable.",
