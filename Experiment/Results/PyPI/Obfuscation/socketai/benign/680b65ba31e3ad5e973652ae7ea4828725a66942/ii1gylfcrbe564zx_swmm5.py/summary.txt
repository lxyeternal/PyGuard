  "conclusion": "The code functions as an obfuscated interface layer to _swmm5 with no direct malicious activity. The high obfuscation score reflects suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. The malware score remains at 0, and the overall security risk is low. Further inspection of the _swmm5 extension itself is recommended if source trustworthiness is uncertain."
