  "purpose": "Wrapper/interface for _swmm5",
  "sources": "Delegates calls to _swmm5 functions and properties",
  "sinks": "Delegated function calls, attribute access to _swmm5",
  "flows": "Function calls and attribute manipulations flow directly to _swmm5",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation, dynamic class and property manipulation, complex naming",
  "analysis": "The code is a heavily obfuscated wrapper around the _swmm5 native extension. It delegates most functionality directly to _swmm5, with no evident data leaks, network activity, or malicious payloads. Obfuscation and dynamic attribute handling are present but do not inherently indicate malicious intent. No suspicious data flows, input handling, or security vulnerabilities are detected within this code fragment. The obfuscation could be for proprietary protection or auto-generation, not necessarily malicious. The native extension _swmm5 is assumed to be open-source and trustworthy unless proven otherwise.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as an obfuscated interface layer to _swmm5 with no direct malicious activity. The high obfuscation score reflects suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. The malware score remains at 0, and the overall security risk is low. Further inspection of the _swmm5 extension itself is recommended if source trustworthiness is uncertain.",
