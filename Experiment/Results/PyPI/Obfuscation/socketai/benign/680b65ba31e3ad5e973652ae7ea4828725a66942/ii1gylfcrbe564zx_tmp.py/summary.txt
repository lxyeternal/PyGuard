  "malware_score": 0.2,
  "security_risk": 0.4,
  "obfuscated": 0.8,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation, which warrants caution, but no direct malicious activity is evident. The low malware score is justified, and the moderate security risk reflects suspicion due to obfuscation. Overall, the risk is moderate, and further analysis of the imported function is advised before deployment."
