  "purpose": "Import specific functions or classes from a local module or package, with a fallback to an alternative module if the first import fails.",
  "sources": "The import statements, which read from local modules (. _fastdtw and .fastdtw).",
  "sinks": "Potentially, the imported entities could be used elsewhere; the import itself is not a sink but can be part of a flow if used improperly later.",
  "flows": "Imported functions/classes may be used elsewhere; no flow is shown in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The imported entities have non-descriptive, obfuscated-looking names, which is unusual and may indicate malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import specific components from a module named '_fastdtw'. If that fails, it falls back to importing from 'fastdtw'. The imported entities have non-meaningful, obfuscated names, which is atypical for normal code and could be used to hide malicious purposes. The pattern of importing from a relative path is standard, but the naming convention is suspicious. There are no other operations or context provided, limiting the ability to fully assess the intent. The code does not exhibit malicious actions on its own but the obfuscated names raise suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple conditional import with obfuscated names, which can be suspicious. However, it does not directly perform malicious actions. The primary concern is the naming pattern, which warrants further review of the actual imported modules. Overall, no explicit malicious behavior is evident in this snippet, but the obfuscation is suspicious.",
