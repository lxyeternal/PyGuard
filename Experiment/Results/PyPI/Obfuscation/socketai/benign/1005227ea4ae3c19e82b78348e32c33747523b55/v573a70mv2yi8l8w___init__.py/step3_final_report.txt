  "sinks": "None present; code only performs imports.",
  "flows": "Import source to identifiers; no data flow beyond module loading.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated, nonsensical identifiers; fallback import pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import two obfuscated functions or classes from a local module, with a fallback to an external module if the first import fails. The obfuscated names suggest an attempt to conceal the actual functions or classes, which could be suspicious. However, no malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code execution is evident. The import pattern itself is common and benign. The high obfuscation scores reflect suspicion but do not confirm malicious intent. Malware scores are low, consistent with the lack of evidence, while risk scores are moderate due to obfuscation potential.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is a fallback import with obfuscated identifiers, raising suspicion primarily due to obfuscation. There is no direct evidence of malicious activity. Further review of the actual modules being imported is recommended to determine if the obfuscation is benign or malicious.",
