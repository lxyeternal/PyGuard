  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging a Python project with a specified name, version, and requirements.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from the 'setup()' function parameters and the import statements.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks where untrusted data leads to leaks or execution; the code only sets package metadata.",
  "flows": "The code reads static strings and variables for setup configuration, with no dynamic or external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of an unrecognized parameter 'XhEcIVGurdpdjJEDutWlYSESBeGynCgi' which appears to be a random or obfuscated string, not a standard setuptools argument.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup()' with standard parameters like name, version, and python_requires. The parameter 'XhEcIVGurdpdjJEDutWlYSESBeGynCgi' is non-standard and looks like an obfuscated or malicious attempt to include hidden or unexpected data. Since 'setup()' does not process unrecognized arguments, this parameter is unlikely to execute any malicious code, but its presence is suspicious and possibly intended to obfuscate or mislead.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard setup configuration with an unusual, non-standard parameter that could be an attempt to hide malicious intent or obfuscate. However, since it doesn't directly cause harm or execute malicious code, the overall risk is low but warrants caution due to the suspicious parameter.",
