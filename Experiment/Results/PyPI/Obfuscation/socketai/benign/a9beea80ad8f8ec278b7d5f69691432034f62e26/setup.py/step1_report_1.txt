  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Importing 'setuptools' and calling setup() with package info.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no execution of untrusted data or network operations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the script primarily defines package metadata without data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of an unconventional attribute 'XhEcIVGurdpdjJEDutWlYSESBeGynCgi' with value 'text/markdown' instead of standard setup parameters. No clear purpose for this attribute, which is unusual and suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'setuptools' library and invokes the 'setup()' function to define package parameters such as name, version, and Python requirements. The only anomaly is the inclusion of a non-standard attribute 'XhEcIVGurdpdjJEDutWlYSESBeGynCgi' with an unrelated value 'text/markdown'. This could be an obfuscation attempt, a placeholder, or malicious tampering. The attribute does not influence standard setup behavior and could be used to hide malicious intent or malicious payloads. There are no other suspicious behaviors, network calls, or data processing observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign setup script with an unusual custom attribute that serves no clear purpose. Its presence may indicate obfuscation or an attempt to hide malicious intent, but based solely on the provided code, no direct malicious activity or security risks are evident. Caution should be maintained if this package is used in broader contexts.",
