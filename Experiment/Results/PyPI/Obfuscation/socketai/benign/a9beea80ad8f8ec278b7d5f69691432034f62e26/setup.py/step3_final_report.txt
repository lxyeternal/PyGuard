  "purpose": "Minimal setup script for a Python package, primarily defining package metadata.",
  "sources": "The 'setup()' function parameters, including 'name', 'version', and the suspicious non-standard attribute 'XhEcIVGurdpdjJEDutWlYSESBeGynCgi'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, no code execution, network activity, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "The non-standard attribute 'XhEcIVGurdpdjJEDutWlYSESBeGynCgi' is set during setup but does not influence package installation or behavior.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of an unrecognized, obfuscated-looking parameter 'XhEcIVGurdpdjJEDutWlYSESBeGynCgi' with value 'text/markdown'. The package name appears nonsensical or obfuscated.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with a suspicious, non-standard parameter that does not affect functionality but indicates obfuscation or potential malicious intent. No malicious code, network activity, or data handling is present. The anomaly is likely an attempt at obfuscation or hiding malicious payloads. The scores assigned in the reports vary but generally reflect low to moderate suspicion, with malware scores around 0.2-0.3, obfuscation scores high (0.6-0.8), and security risk around 0.3-0.4. Given the benign nature of the code but considering the suspicious parameter, a conservative assessment assigns a malware score of approximately 0.2-0.3, obfuscation around 0.7, and risk around 0.4.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign in execution but contains obfuscation through a non-standard parameter, which warrants caution. No active malicious activity is evident. The scores should reflect low malware risk with moderate suspicion due to obfuscation. Further scrutiny or sandbox testing is recommended before trusting or deploying this package.",
