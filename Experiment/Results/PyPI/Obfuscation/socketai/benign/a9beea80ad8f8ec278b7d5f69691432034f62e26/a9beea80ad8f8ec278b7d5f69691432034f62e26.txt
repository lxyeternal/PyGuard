      "conclusion": "The code is benign in execution but contains obfuscation through a non-standard parameter, which warrants caution. No active malicious activity is evident. The scores should reflect low malware risk with moderate suspicion due to obfuscation. Further scrutiny or sandbox testing is recommended before trusting or deploying this package."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate data retrieval utility with obfuscation and a bug. No evidence of malicious activity or security threats is present. The scores are appropriate: malware=0, obfuscated=0.6, risk=0.2. The primary concern is fixing the bug and possibly addressing obfuscation for clarity. Overall, the code is benign with minor issues."
