  "purpose": "Import the Connect class from the sheetconnect module, likely for establishing a connection to a sheet or spreadsheet.",
  "sources": "The import statement imports code from a local module named sheetconnect.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are evident in this single line; however, if the imported Connect class is used later, it could serve as a sink for untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The code indicates a source (import) leading to potential use of Connect class as a sink in later code, but no flow is observable here.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a class from a local module. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or suspicious patterns. Without additional context, the import alone is benign. No suspicious data flows or anomalies are detected at this stage.",
  "conclusion": "This line of code appears to be a standard import statement with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It is likely part of a larger, benign program.",
