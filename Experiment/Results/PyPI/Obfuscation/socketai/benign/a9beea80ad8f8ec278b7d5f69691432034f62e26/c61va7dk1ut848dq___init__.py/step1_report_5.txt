  "purpose": "The code imports the Connect class from a local module named sheetconnect, likely used for establishing a connection to a sheet or spreadsheet.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the sheetconnect module from the same package or directory.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; the code only imports a class without executing any further actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data processing observed in this snippet; the import is static.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, and no anomalies are visible. The module name 'sheetconnect' could suggest external data interactions, but no such actions are shown here.",
  "analysis": "This code only imports a class, with no active data input, processing, or output. Without additional context, there are no security risks, malicious behavior, or obfuscation apparent. The import could be part of a larger, legitimate codebase.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, performing a simple import. Additional context is needed for a comprehensive assessment.",
