  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple import statement: `from .sheetconnect import Connect`.\n   - There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or anomalies in the code snippets themselves.\n   - The code is benign and typical for Python projects.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly note the minimal nature of the code and lack of suspicious activity.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, aligning with the benign nature of the snippet.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0, which is reasonable since a simple import generally poses minimal risk.\n   - **Confidence Scores:** Ranging from 0.8 to 0.9, reflecting high confidence in benignity.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - The highest security risk score is 0.1, which is appropriate for a benign import statement.\n   - No justification exists for higher scores, as there's no evidence of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0.\n   - The code does not exhibit malicious behavior; importing a class alone is not harmful.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they acknowledge that this is just an import statement and that further context is needed for definitive conclusions.\n   - They do not infer malicious intent where none is evident.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code snippets and their analysis.\n   - No discrepancies or unreasonable scoring are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** — minimal risk, given the benign import statement.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- If future code using this import introduces vulnerabilities or malicious behavior, reevaluation would be necessary.\n- The current analysis aligns with the evidence: simple, standard import statements with no signs of security issues.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, and the scores reflect that accurately. No changes are needed based on the provided snippets.",
