  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code snippet:\n\nOriginal Code:\n```python\nfrom .sheetconnect import Connect\n```\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code**\n\n- The code is a straightforward import statement, importing `Connect` from a local module `sheetconnect`.  \n- There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or anomalies in this line.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the logic, reasoning, and summaries**\n\n- All reports agree that this is a benign import statement with no immediate security concerns.\n- They correctly identify the lack of anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.8 or 0.9), which seems appropriate given the simplicity of the code.\n\n**Step 3: Review scores assigned to each issue**\n\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is reasonable since the code is clear.\n- **Malware:** All assign 0, consistent with the absence of malicious indicators.\n- **Security Risk:** Mostly 0.1, except one report assigns 0, which is more appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Confidence:** Ranges from 0.8 to 0.9, fitting for such a simple import statement.\n\n**Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5**\n\n- No reason exists to assign a high risk score; the code is benign.\n- The low risk scores (0 or 0.1) are justified.\n\n**Step 5: Malware score considerations**\n\n- Since the code only imports a class and there's no malicious activity, malware score should remain 0.\n\n**Step 6: Challenge assumptions about vulnerabilities**\n\n- The reports do not assume vulnerabilities; they correctly state that this line alone is benign.\n- No unwarranted assumptions are made.\n\n**Step 7: Consistency of scores**\n\n- The scores are consistent with the code snippet and the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 or 0 (more accurate to set at 0, since no risk is evident)\n\n### Additional notes:\n\n- Given only this import statement, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security risk.\n- The confidence levels are appropriate, though slightly higher confidence (0.9) might be justified for the clear benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0 (since no actual risk is present)\n\nThis aligns with the assessments and the code's simplicity.",
