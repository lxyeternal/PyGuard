  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, configuration-driven Flask extension for Google reCAPTCHA with superficial obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or supply chain compromise. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is zero. The obfuscation score could be moderated from 0.7 to around 0.4 to better reflect superficial obfuscation without implying malicious intent."
