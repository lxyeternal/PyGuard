  "purpose": "A Flask extension for integrating Google reCAPTCHA, rendering the widget HTML with configuration-driven parameters.",
  "sources": "Configuration values from Flask app config (e.g., RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY, RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY, theme, type, size, tabindex).",
  "sinks": "HTML output embedding the reCAPTCHA widget; no outbound network requests or data leaks within the provided code.",
  "flows": "Configuration values are loaded from app config, used to generate HTML markup for the reCAPTCHA widget.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class and variable names; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns; no malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Flask extension for embedding Google reCAPTCHA, with superficial obfuscation through naming. It reads configuration from the Flask app, generates HTML markup for the widget, and does not perform any network requests or data exfiltration. No hardcoded secrets or malicious behaviors are present. The obfuscation appears to be an attempt to conceal variable names but does not indicate malicious intent. The code is benign and aligns with typical reCAPTCHA integration patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, configuration-driven Flask extension for Google reCAPTCHA with superficial obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or supply chain compromise. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is zero. The obfuscation score could be moderated from 0.7 to around 0.4 to better reflect superficial obfuscation without implying malicious intent.",
