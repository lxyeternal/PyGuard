  "purpose": "The code defines a Flask extension for integrating Google reCAPTCHA verification into web applications.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration variables such as 'RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY', 'RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY', 'RECAPTCHA_ENABLED', 'RECAPTCHA_THEME', 'RECAPTCHA_TYPE', 'RECAPTCHA_SIZE', 'RECAPTCHA_TABINDEX' from app.config; accesses request context indirectly via Flask's request.",
  "sinks": "Generates HTML/JavaScript code for embedding reCAPTCHA widget using provided site key and parameters.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from app.config into class initialization; then into HTML rendering via template context processor.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded string constants that appear to be package metadata; no suspicious code injection, obfuscated code, or backdoors detected; code is straightforward, standard for reCAPTCHA integration.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical implementation of a Flask extension for reCAPTCHA. It reads configuration variables for site key and secret key, and optionally other display parameters. It provides a context processor to inject HTML markup for the reCAPTCHA widget into templates. No dynamic code execution, network communications outside Google reCAPTCHA API, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are embedded within the code; configuration is expected to be supplied externally via app.config. The code structure is standard and clear, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. It appears to serve its intended purpose securely.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, non-malicious Flask extension for integrating Google reCAPTCHA. No malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious activities are detected. It relies on external configuration for sensitive keys and does not perform any insecure operations.",
