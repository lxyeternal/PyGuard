  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package, defining metadata, dependencies, and classifiers.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools and the flask_recaptcha module; attribute access from the module for setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static metadata assignment only.",
  "flows": "Module import -> variable assignment -> attribute access -> setup() parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, indirect attribute access, inclusion of a URL in metadata, no validation or sanitization.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names, likely to conceal details. It does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or execute malicious code directly. The URL and dynamic attribute access could be exploited in a malicious context, but in this fragment, they serve as package metadata. No signs of malware, backdoors, or data exfiltration are present. The obfuscation is superficial, primarily hiding variable identities, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign package setup script with superficial obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or active security threats. The obfuscation may be for concealment or packaging purposes but does not indicate malicious intent in this context.",
