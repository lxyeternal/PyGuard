  "purpose": "Parse a version string '7.0.1' into a tuple of integers",
  "sources": "The string '7.0.1' assigned to variable 'WhYjyNVbQjkITvUfqAKXHshHNZPrUDNJ'",
  "sinks": "Conversion of split string segments into integers; no untrusted data used for system or network operations",
  "flows": "Reading the version string -> splitting into components -> converting components to integers",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names, but no code obfuscation or malicious behavior detected; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to a variable with an obfuscated name. It then splits this string by '.' and converts each part into an integer, storing the result in a tuple with an equally obfuscated name. The operations are straightforward string parsing without any external inputs, system modifications, or data exfiltration. No suspicious behavior or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code simply parses a version string into a tuple of integers, with no malicious intent or security risks present.",
