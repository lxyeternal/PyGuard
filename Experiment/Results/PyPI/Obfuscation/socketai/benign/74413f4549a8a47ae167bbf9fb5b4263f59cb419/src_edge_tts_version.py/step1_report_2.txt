  "flows": "Input string -> split by '.' -> convert each segment to int -> create tuple",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names; no apparent malicious code behavior",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version string and splits it into parts, converting each to an integer, then packs into a tuple. The variable names are obfuscated, but the logic is straightforward and common for version handling. No input from external sources, no suspicious functions or data leaks, no dynamic execution or external network calls. The code appears to serve a simple version parsing purpose without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign version parsing snippet with obfuscated variable names. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks.",
