  "flows": "Read string from variable -> split by '.' -> convert each part to int -> create tuple",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names, no user input, no dynamic code, no hardcoded credentials or secrets, no external data sources",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a string representing a version number to a variable with an obfuscated name. It then splits the string by '.' and converts each part to an integer, storing the result in a tuple with an equally obfuscated name. There are no external data inputs, no dangerous operations, and no suspicious behavior. The code appears to be a straightforward version parsing operation with deliberately obfuscated variable names, likely to evade casual inspection, but it does not perform any malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version parsing routine with obfuscated variable names. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation appears intentional but does not indicate malicious intent.",
