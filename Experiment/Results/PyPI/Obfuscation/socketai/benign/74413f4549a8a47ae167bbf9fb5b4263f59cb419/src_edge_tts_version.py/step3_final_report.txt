  "purpose": "Parse a version string '7.0.1' into a tuple of integers.",
  "sources": "The string '7.0.1' assigned to an obfuscated variable.",
  "sinks": "Conversion of each version segment to integers; no external data or untrusted sources involved.",
  "flows": "Splitting the version string by '.', converting each segment to int, storing in a tuple.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; no malicious or suspicious code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static version string to a variable, splits it by '.', converts each segment into an integer, and stores it in a tuple. The logic is straightforward, with no external inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution. Variable obfuscation is superficial and does not imply malicious intent. No vulnerabilities or malicious actions are present. The code is benign and serves a simple purpose of version parsing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward version parser with superficial obfuscation. No malicious behavior, security vulnerabilities, or malicious intent are detected. The obfuscation does not elevate concern, and the code is safe for use.",
