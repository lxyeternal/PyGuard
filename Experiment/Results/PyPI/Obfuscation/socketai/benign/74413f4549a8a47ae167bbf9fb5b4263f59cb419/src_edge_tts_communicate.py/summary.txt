  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate speech synthesis client with significant obfuscation and complex network handling. While no direct malicious activity is evident, the heavy obfuscation and external dependencies raise suspicion. The malware score is set at 0.5, reflecting moderate suspicion, and the overall security risk is moderate at 0.4. Further manual analysis and runtime testing are recommended before deployment."
