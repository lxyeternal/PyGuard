  "conclusion": "The code is benign and intended for API request setup to a speech service. No malware or malicious behavior is detected. The main concern is the presence of hardcoded tokens and environment-dependent headers, which should be managed securely. Variable obfuscation is minimal. Overall, the code warrants caution regarding token exposure but does not constitute malicious or obfuscated code."
