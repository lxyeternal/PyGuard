  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard TTS CLI utility with obfuscated module names. There is no direct evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. The obfuscation warrants caution and further review of the imported modules, but based on the provided code snippet, the package is likely benign. The malware score should remain at 0, with a moderate obfuscation score and low security risk."
