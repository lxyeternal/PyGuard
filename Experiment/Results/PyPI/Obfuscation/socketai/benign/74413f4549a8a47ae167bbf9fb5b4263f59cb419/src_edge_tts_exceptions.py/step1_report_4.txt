{
  "purpose": "Defines several custom exception classes with class variables containing seemingly random strings.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and class variable assignments.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; class variables are static strings.",
  "anomalies": "All class variables contain random-looking strings; no functions or methods performing actions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from a custom exception, each with a class variable assigned to a seemingly arbitrary string. There are no input handling, no output, no network operations, no cryptographic or data processing functions, and no evident malicious behavior or malicious code flow. The random strings appear to be placeholders or obfuscated data but do not constitute malicious actions. The code structure is minimal and doesn't perform any operations beyond class variable assignments.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be simple class definitions with no active functionality or external interactions. No suspicious or malicious activity detected.",
