  "purpose": "Define several custom exception classes with obfuscated attribute names and string values.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and attribute assignments.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data flows or output destinations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; classes and attributes are static and not used for data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of multiple classes with obfuscated attribute names containing static strings, no functional code, no input handling, and no output or network activity. No evident malicious intent or obfuscation beyond naming.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class declarations inheriting from a base exception class. Each class has a class attribute with a seemingly random string. No methods, input processing, or external interactions are present. The code appears to be designed either as placeholders or obfuscated code without functional logic. The static string attributes are not used, and there's no suspicious activity such as data exfiltration, network access, or system modification. The obfuscated attribute names and strings do not indicate malicious behavior; they may be intentionally obscured or generated names.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of obfuscated class definitions with no operational behavior or data flows that could indicate malicious intent. It does not perform any harmful actions, nor does it contain malicious payloads or backdoors. The static strings are harmless but obfuscated, possibly for placeholder or code-generation purposes.",
