{
  "purpose": "The code defines multiple classes inheriting from a custom exception base class, each with a static string attribute assigned a seemingly random value. There are no functions, data flows, external interactions, or active logic.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and static string attributes within each class.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static attributes do not process or transmit data.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names, static strings with no meaningful context, no methods or dynamic behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of obfuscated class definitions with static string attributes. There is no active logic, data processing, or external interaction. The obfuscation may be intended to conceal purpose but does not demonstrate malicious intent or active security risks. The absence of data flow, network activity, or code execution points to a benign static structure. The high obfuscation score is justified by the nonsensical naming and static strings, while malware and security risk scores are justified as zero or very low due to lack of active behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is obfuscated but does not exhibit malicious behavior or active security threats. The static nature and lack of data flow or external interactions suggest a low security risk. The obfuscation is high, which warrants caution if part of a larger codebase, but on its own, it appears benign.",
