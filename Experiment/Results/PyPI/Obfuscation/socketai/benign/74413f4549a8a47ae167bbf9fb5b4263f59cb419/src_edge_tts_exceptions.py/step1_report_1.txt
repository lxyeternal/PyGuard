{
  "purpose": "Defines several custom exception classes with seemingly random class and variable names, possibly obfuscating intent.",
  "sources": "No input or external data read; all data are hardcoded string variables within class attributes.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks or data flows involving untrusted input or external systems.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows present; classes contain only static string attributes with no methods or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated class and variable names; no functional logic or meaningful operations; only static string attributes, which appear meaningless and possibly designed to evade detection.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple classes inheriting from a custom exception base, each with a single class attribute assigned a random-looking string. There are no functions, no data processing, no input/output operations, and no interactions with external systems. The structure resembles obfuscation, possibly to hide malicious intent, but there is no active or malicious behavior visible within this fragment. The code does not perform any operations, network activity, or data manipulation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be obfuscated class definitions with no executable logic, input, or output. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior directly. However, the obfuscation may be used to hide malicious intent in larger contexts or other parts of the codebase. Based solely on this fragment, the risk is low, but caution is advised if part of a larger obfuscated package.",
