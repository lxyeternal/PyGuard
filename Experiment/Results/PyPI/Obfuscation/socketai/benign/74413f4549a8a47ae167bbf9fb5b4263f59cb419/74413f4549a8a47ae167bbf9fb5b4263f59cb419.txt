      "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated elements that warrant caution but shows no direct evidence of malicious activity. The suspicious parameter and string could be benign or malicious depending on their usage elsewhere. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and further investigation into the parameter's purpose is recommended."

While no direct malicious activity is evident, the heavy obfuscation and external dependencies raise suspicion. The malware score is set at 0.5, reflecting moderate suspicion, and the overall security risk is moderate at 0.4. Further manual analysis and runtime testing are recommended before deployment."

      "conclusion": "The code is obfuscated but does not exhibit malicious behavior or active security threats. The static nature and lack of data flow or external interactions suggest a low security risk. The obfuscation is high, which warrants caution if part of a larger codebase, but on its own, it appears benign."

The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; the high obfuscation score in Report 3 is justified by naming style but does not imply malicious intent. Overall, the code is safe and should not be flagged for security concerns."

The obfuscation warrants caution and further review of the imported modules, but based on the provided code snippet, the package is likely benign. The malware score should remain at 0, with a moderate obfuscation score and low security risk."

The main concern is the presence of hardcoded tokens and environment-dependent headers, which should be managed securely. Variable obfuscation is minimal. Overall, the code warrants caution regarding token exposure but does not constitute malicious or obfuscated code."
