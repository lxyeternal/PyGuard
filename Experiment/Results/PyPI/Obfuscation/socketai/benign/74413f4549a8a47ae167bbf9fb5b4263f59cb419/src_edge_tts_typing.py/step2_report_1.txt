  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the accuracy of their assessments, the consistency of the scores, and whether any issues are overlooked.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Purpose:** Defines TypedDict classes for audio and voice configuration.  \n- **Findings:** No data processing, no external interactions, no anomalies.  \n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies that the code is purely data schema definitions with no malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.  \n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Purpose:** Defines structured data types for voice/audio parameters.  \n- **Findings:** Static class definitions, no data handling or external calls, no anomalies.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct; the code is just data schemas.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.  \n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Purpose:** Data structures for audio/voice, with notably long and obfuscated class/variable names.  \n- **Findings:** No executable code, no external data handling, but obfuscated naming conventions.  \n- **Analysis:** The obfuscation could suggest auto-generation or code obfuscation, but not necessarily malicious intent.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0.8, obfuscated=0.8, confidence=0.9.  \n**Potential Issue:** The high obfuscation score warrants caution. However, the report correctly notes that no malicious behavior is detected.  \n**Verdict:** The high obfuscation score is justified given the naming style, but since there's no malicious activity, malware=0 is correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Purpose:** Data structures for voice/audio, likely for speech processing.  \n- **Findings:** No runtime logic, no external interactions, no anomalies.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct, the code is purely schema definitions.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.  \n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Purpose:** Typed data structures for voice/audio configuration.  \n- **Findings:** No external data sources, no data flow, no anomalies.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct, the code is only data schemas.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.  \n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is purely structural data definitions with no malicious or security-sensitive logic.\n- The only point of contention is the obfuscation in Report 3, which is justified by the unusual class and variable names. However, since no malicious activity is present, the malware score remains at 0, which is appropriate.\n- The confidence levels are consistent with the findings.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports — no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Slightly elevated (around 0.8) in Report 3 due to naming conventions, which is justified.\n- **Risk Score:** 0, as there are no security vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.7 (due to naming conventions, but not malicious)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, serving solely as data schemas for voice/audio configuration, with no security risks or malware present.",
