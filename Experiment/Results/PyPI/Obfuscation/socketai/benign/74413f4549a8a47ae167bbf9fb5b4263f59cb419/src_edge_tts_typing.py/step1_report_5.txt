{
  "purpose": "Define typed data structures for handling audio and voice configuration data",
  "sources": "No input reading or external data sources; the code only defines classes",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output or external communication; purely data structure definitions",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as there is no executable logic or data processing",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation observed",
  "analysis": "The code strictly consists of TypedDict class definitions for structured data representation related to audio and voice settings. There are no functions, data processing, input handling, or external communication. All types and literals appear to be standard data modeling constructs. No signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious logic, are present. The code appears to serve as schema definitions or data contracts within a larger application.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely structural and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as data schema definitions without executable logic or external interactions. Therefore, it poses no security threat.",
