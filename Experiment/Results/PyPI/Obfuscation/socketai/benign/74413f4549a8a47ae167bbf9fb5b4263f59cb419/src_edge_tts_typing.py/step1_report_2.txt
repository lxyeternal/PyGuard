  "purpose": "Define structured data types for audio and voice configuration parameters.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading functions; all are type definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output functions; only data structure definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flows; only type annotations and class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious or unusual code patterns, no external network calls, or system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions using Python's typing and TypedDict for data structure annotations. It specifies types for audio data, categories, voice personalities, and metadata for voice configurations. There are no functions, data processing, or external interactions. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. The code appears to be a typical schema definition for a speech or voice-related system.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for defining data schemas related to voice and audio configurations. It contains no malicious code, suspicious behavior, or security risks. It is a benign and straightforward set of type annotations for data validation or documentation purposes.",
