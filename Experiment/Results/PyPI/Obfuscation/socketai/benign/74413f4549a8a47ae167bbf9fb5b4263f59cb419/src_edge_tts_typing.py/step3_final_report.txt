  "purpose": "Defines TypedDict classes for audio and voice configuration, categories, and related metadata.",
  "sources": "Class definitions with type annotations; no input/output or external data handling.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing, external calls, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Purely static type definitions; no data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated or auto-generated-looking class and variable names, but no malicious code or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of data schema definitions using TypedDict, with no executable logic, data handling, or external interactions. The naming conventions appear obfuscated or auto-generated but do not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, network calls, or security vulnerabilities are present. The high obfuscation score in some reports is justified by naming style but does not imply malicious behavior. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, with malware scores of 0 and risk scores of 0. The obfuscation score could be slightly elevated (~0.2) due to naming but is not indicative of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely as data schemas for voice/audio configuration. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; the high obfuscation score in Report 3 is justified by naming style but does not imply malicious intent. Overall, the code is safe and should not be flagged for security concerns.",
