  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Summary:** The code is only type definitions with no data handling, no external interactions, and no anomalies.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is benign schema definitions.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is only data schemas with no malicious behavior.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues detected.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Summary:** Notes the obfuscated-looking class names and variable names, but clarifies that these are just structural definitions with no executable code or malicious intent.  \n- **Assessment:** The obfuscation is likely auto-generated or stylistic, not malicious. No actual malicious behavior is indicated.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0.8 (due to naming style), Risk: 0.8 — this seems high. The obfuscation alone doesn't imply security risk or malware. Obfuscation is common in auto-generated code, and without malicious behavior, a high malware score isn't justified. I suggest lowering the malware score to 0 and the risk score to 0.2 at most, reflecting the obfuscation but not a security threat.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Summary:** Again, only data schemas with no runtime logic or external interactions, no anomalies.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Summary:** Same conclusion: purely structural data definitions, no malicious behavior.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious code. The one report's high malware score due to obfuscated names is unwarranted. Obfuscation alone does not imply malware.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** Slightly high in Report 3, but the obfuscation appears to be stylistic or auto-generated, not malicious.\n\n- **Risk score:** Since there's no executable code, data handling, or external interactions, the overall security risk remains negligible.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports, as no malicious activity is present.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.2 in Report 3 (due to naming style), 0 elsewhere.\n\n- **Risk score:** 0 for all, given the absence of security vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n**In conclusion**, the code is a set of data schemas with no security concerns. The high malware score in Report 3 is unjustified and should be lowered. The obfuscation noted does not constitute a security threat but is worth noting as stylistic or auto-generated naming.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 3       | 0       | 0.2          | 0.2   |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the nature of the code.",
