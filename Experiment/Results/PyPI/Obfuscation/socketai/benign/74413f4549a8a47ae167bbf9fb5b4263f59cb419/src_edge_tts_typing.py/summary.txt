  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely as data schemas for voice/audio configuration. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; the high obfuscation score in Report 3 is justified by naming style but does not imply malicious intent. Overall, the code is safe and should not be flagged for security concerns."
