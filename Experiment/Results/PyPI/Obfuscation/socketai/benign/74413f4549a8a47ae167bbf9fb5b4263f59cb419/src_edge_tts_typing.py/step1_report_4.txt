{
  "purpose": "Define TypedDict classes for handling audio and voice-related data structures, likely for a speech or audio processing application.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are explicitly read in the code; it only defines data structures.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or output points for untrusted data are present; the code solely defines data schemas.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs within this code snippet; it only declares type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or malicious constructs are present. The code solely consists of type class definitions with no runtime logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several TypedDict classes to structure audio and voice data, including metadata such as categories, personalities, gender, locale, and other related fields. The use of literals and optional fields appears to be for data validation and organization. There are no functions, data processing, external inputs, or output operations. The code does not perform any dynamic execution, network operations, or security-sensitive actions. It appears to be standard, well-structured data schema definitions with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely structural, defining data types for audio and voice data without any runtime behavior or external interactions. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The code is safe and appears to serve as part of a larger application architecture.",
