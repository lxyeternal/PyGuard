  "purpose": "Define TypedDict classes for handling audio and voice configuration data",
  "sources": "No input sources or external data reads; class definitions are static",
  "sinks": "No data output or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow or processing logic; only type definitions",
  "anomalies": "Presence of long, obfuscated class names and variable names; no executable or data processing code; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of TypedDict class definitions with detailed type annotations for audio, voice, and language settings. There are no functions, input handling, network calls, or data processing logic. The naming conventions are unusual but appear to be auto-generated or obfuscated, which is common in some code obfuscation or auto-generated code but not inherently malicious. No external data sources, sinks, or execution paths are present. The code does not perform any operations that could be malicious or compromise security.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be purely structural, defining data types without any executable logic. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The obfuscated style is likely for code organization or auto-generation purposes rather than malicious intent.",
