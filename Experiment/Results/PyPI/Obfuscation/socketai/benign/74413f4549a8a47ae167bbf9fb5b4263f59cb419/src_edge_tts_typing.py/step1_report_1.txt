  "purpose": "Definition of TypedDict classes for data structures related to audio and voice configuration.",
  "sources": "None; the code consists solely of type definitions and class declarations.",
  "sinks": "None; no data handling or processing occurs within this code.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow or processing logic is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present in the code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several TypedDict classes with static string literals and basic data types. No dynamic code execution, input handling, or external interactions are present. The classes seem to model configuration data for audio and voice settings. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. All elements are typical for data structure definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is solely composed of data structure definitions with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not include any harmful logic, input/output operations, or external calls.",
