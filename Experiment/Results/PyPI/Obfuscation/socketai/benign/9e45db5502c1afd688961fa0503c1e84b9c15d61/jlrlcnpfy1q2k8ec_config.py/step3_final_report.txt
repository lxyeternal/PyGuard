  "purpose": "Configuration setup for a service using pydantic's BaseSettings with environment-based parameters.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, filesystem check for '/var/secrets'",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; configuration parameters are used internally",
  "flows": "Environment variables and filesystem check influence class attributes; no data flows to external systems",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; conditional path based on directory existence",
  "analysis": "The code defines a configuration class with default values and environment variable mappings. It uses a filesystem check to set a path parameter. No suspicious imports or code execution are present. The obfuscated variable names could be for security through obscurity but do not indicate malicious intent. The code appears benign, with no network activity or data exfiltration. The configuration is standard and does not perform any dangerous operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical configuration class with no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscated variable names are not sufficient to conclude malicious intent. The overall security risk is minimal, and no malware is detected.",
