  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully.\n\n1. **Code Content & Actual Presence of Issues**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code only contains import statements from the 'celery.canvas' module. There are no data flows, no execution, no handling of untrusted input, and no dynamic code. The code is benign and standard for setting up Celery task workflows.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly state that the code is only importing functions/classes for task orchestration and does not pose any security risks or malicious behavior. There are no logical flaws or misconceptions evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**  \n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct since the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.  \n- **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, aligning with the fact that no security risks are present in this code snippet.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nSince the code is only import statements with no malicious activity, there is no justification for higher risk scores. The reports correctly reflect this.\n\n5. **Potential Vulnerabilities Based on Assumptions**  \nThe reports do not assume vulnerabilities; they correctly state that this code alone does not introduce vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**  \nThe scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation & Personal Assessment\n\n**Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious activity detected.  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0 — Clear, straightforward import statements.  \n**Risk Score:** 0 — No security risks or vulnerabilities evident.\n\n**Additional notes:**  \nWhile the code itself is benign, it’s important to consider the larger context. If this code is part of a larger application, the actual security posture depends on how these imported functions are used. However, based solely on this snippet, there is no concern.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is a standard, safe import setup for Celery task orchestration with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk assessments.",
