  "purpose": "Import statements for Celery task orchestration components, setting up task workflows.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from the 'celery.canvas' module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data flow or execution logic present.",
  "flows": "None; only static imports without data or control flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code; straightforward import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from a well-known library, with no dynamic code, data handling, or network activity. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup for Celery task orchestration with no security concerns or malicious intent. The reports are accurate, and the current scoring accurately reflects the benign nature of this code snippet.",
