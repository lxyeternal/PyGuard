  "purpose": "Import statements for Celery task composition and orchestration functions",
  "sources": "Imports from the 'celery.canvas' module",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flow observed within this snippet; imports do not execute code or handle data directly",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for various task composition functions from the 'celery.canvas' module. These functions are used to define and orchestrate asynchronous tasks in Celery. There are no data inputs, outputs, or execution logic present. The imports appear standard for a Celery-based application. No suspicious or malicious activity, such as network access, data leakage, or backdoors, is evident in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a straightforward set of import statements for task orchestration tools in Celery, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is benign and appears to be part of a larger application that uses Celery for task management.",
