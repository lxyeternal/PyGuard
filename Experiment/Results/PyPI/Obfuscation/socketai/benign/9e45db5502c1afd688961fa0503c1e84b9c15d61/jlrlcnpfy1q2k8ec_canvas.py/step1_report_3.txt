  "purpose": "Import statements for Celery task composition and orchestration",
  "sources": "Import statements extracting classes and functions from 'celery.canvas'",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as this is only an import statement",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior observed in import statements",
  "analysis": "The code imports various classes and functions related to Celery's task composition features such as chain, chord, group, and signature types. These are standard components used to construct complex asynchronous task workflows. There is no code execution, data handling, or logic in this snippet. The imported functions are intended for task orchestration and do not inherently pose security risks or malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward import statement for Celery task orchestration utilities with no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be a standard setup for task workflow definitions.",
