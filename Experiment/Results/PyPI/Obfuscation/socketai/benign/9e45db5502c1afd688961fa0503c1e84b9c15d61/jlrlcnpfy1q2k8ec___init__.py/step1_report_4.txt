  "purpose": "Retrieve package version information and import modules for further processing.",
  "sources": "metadata.version(__name__), importlib.metadata, numpy, local modules (.algos, .canvas, .tasks)",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data output or external network interactions present",
  "flows": "metadata.version(__name__) to variable, module imports, optional attribute setting for numpy, local module imports",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic version retrieval via importlib.metadata, conditional modification of numpy's defchararray attribute, import of all contents from local modules",
  "analysis": "The code primarily retrieves the current package's version and sets up dependencies. The line with importlib.metadata retrieves version info, which is a standard, safe operation. The conditional modification of numpy's defchararray is a harmless compatibility fix. Importing modules with '*' can obscure what is imported but is not inherently malicious. No data leaks, network calls, or suspicious behaviors are present. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard package setup tasks without any signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe based on the provided snippet.",
