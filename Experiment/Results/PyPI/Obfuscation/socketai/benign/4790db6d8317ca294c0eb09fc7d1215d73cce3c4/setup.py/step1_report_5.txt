  "purpose": "Setup script for the '12306-booking' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks that could lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md -> setup configuration, no flow of untrusted data to critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of non-descriptive, obfuscated-like variable names (e.g., iVuaaQAutdKrWHBhULWWiTudLdUeHHKo, fjuPaDztooyYzCmpDnnBzMbqxdaDyVAf), which may indicate an attempt to hide intent. No actual malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py configuration for a Python package, with obfuscated variable names likely used to hide or obscure intent. It reads a README file for the description, defines package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. No external input processing, no code execution, no network activity, or suspicious logic detected. No hardcoded credentials or malicious behaviors are evident. The obfuscation appears superficial and for concealment rather than malicious purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical setup script with obfuscated variable names. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The obfuscation might be to avoid straightforward detection but does not indicate malicious intent.",
