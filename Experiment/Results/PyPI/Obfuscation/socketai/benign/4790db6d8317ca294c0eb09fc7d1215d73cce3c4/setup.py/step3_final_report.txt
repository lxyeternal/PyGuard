  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file, variables passed into setuptools.setup() such as name, version, author, description, package data, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external communication; variables are used internally for package configuration.",
  "flows": "Reading README content into a variable, then passing variables into setuptools.setup() without dynamic execution or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names (e.g., iVuaaQAutdKrWHBhULWWiTudLdUeHHKo) that do not serve a functional purpose but are superficial obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package, with obfuscated variable names that do not impact functionality. No malicious code, network activity, or data leaks are present. The obfuscation appears superficial, likely intended to hinder readability but not malicious. The malware score is correctly assigned as 0, and security risk is minimal (~0.1). The obfuscation score reflects superficial obfuscation but does not imply malicious intent. Overall, the code is benign and safe for use.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with superficial obfuscation. No malicious activity or security vulnerabilities are detected. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No further action is necessary.",
