{
  "purpose": "The code is setting up a Python package named '12306-booking', including reading a README file and configuring package metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for description content.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or external communication are present.",
  "flows": "The description data from 'README.md' flows into the package setup configuration. No other data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated-like variable names (e.g., iVuaaQAutdKrWHBhULWWiTudLdUeHHKo), but no malicious activity detected. The package metadata appears standard. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are present. The code performs straightforward setup operations without dynamic execution or external calls.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a standard package setup using setuptools, reading the README file for description. The variable names are unusually long and nonsensical but do not indicate malicious intent. No code injection, external network communication, or sensitive data handling is evident. The code adheres to typical packaging patterns and contains no suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python package setup script with obfuscated variable names but no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
