{
  "purpose": "The code defines multiple classes inheriting from a custom exception class, each containing static string attributes with seemingly random data. There is no active logic, data flow, or external interactions.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and static string attributes",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data flows are present",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; static data assigned at class level",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and attribute names, static strings that could potentially be secrets, but no active malicious code or behavior",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class declarations with static string attributes, likely obfuscated or placeholder code. No functions, input/output, network activity, or dynamic behavior are present. The obfuscation appears superficial, primarily through nonsensical class and attribute names. The static strings could be sensitive, but without evidence of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, code injection, or network communication, the code appears benign. The high obfuscation scores in the reports are justified, but malware scores should remain low given the lack of active malicious behavior. The overall security risk is minimal, primarily related to obfuscation rather than malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is static, obfuscated class declarations with static string attributes, with no evidence of malicious behavior or active security threats. The obfuscation is superficial, and the code appears benign. Scores in the reports are appropriate, with high obfuscation scores justified by naming patterns, and malware scores correctly low. No active malicious intent is detected, and the overall security risk is minimal.",
