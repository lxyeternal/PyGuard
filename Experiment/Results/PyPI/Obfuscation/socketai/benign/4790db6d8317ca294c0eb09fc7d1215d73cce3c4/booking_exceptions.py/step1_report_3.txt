  "purpose": "Define several custom exception classes, each with a class-level attribute containing a string value.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and class-level attribute assignments.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Class definitions and attribute assignments; no data flow from source to sink involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "All classes are empty except for static string attributes. No dynamic code execution, no use of input, environment variables, or network calls. No suspicious or malicious behavior evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from a base exception class. Each class contains a single class attribute assigned a seemingly random string. There are no functions, no data processing, and no input/output operations. The classes are simple containers for static data. No evidence of obfuscation techniques or malicious behavior, and no dynamic or external data interactions are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign, serving solely as custom exception classes with static attributes. No malicious activity, data leakage, or security risks are detected.",
