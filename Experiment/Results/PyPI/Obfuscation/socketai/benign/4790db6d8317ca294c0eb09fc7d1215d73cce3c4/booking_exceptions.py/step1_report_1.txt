{
  "purpose": "The code defines several custom exception classes with seemingly random class names and class attributes, without any functional code or operations.",
  "sources": "Class attribute assignments; no external input sources or data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data handling functions are present; no untrusted data or output points identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow, input, or output paths are evident; the classes are only definitions with static attributes.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual class and attribute names that appear randomly generated, with no clear functional purpose; no code execution, data processing, or network activity; lack of meaningful logic; presence of only class declarations with static string attributes.",
  "analysis": "The code contains multiple class definitions that inherit from a custom exception class. Each class has a single class attribute with a random string assigned. There are no methods, no data processing, no input/output operations, and no code that interacts with external systems or data. The naming appears obfuscated or randomly generated, which can sometimes be an indicator of attempts to hide malicious intent. However, in this case, there is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communication, or system manipulation. The code is structurally simple, static, and non-functional.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be obfuscated class declarations with no active logic, input, output, or malicious actions. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks based on the provided code. It may be part of a larger obfuscated codebase or placeholder code.",
