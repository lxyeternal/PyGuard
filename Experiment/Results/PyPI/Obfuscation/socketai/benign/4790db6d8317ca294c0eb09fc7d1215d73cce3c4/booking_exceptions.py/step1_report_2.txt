{
  "purpose": "Define multiple custom exception classes, some inheriting from a base exception class.",
  "sources": "No external input sources or data reading functions present.",
  "sinks": "No use of untrusted data, external resources, or data output functions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks, as the code only defines classes with class attributes.",
  "anomalies": "All classes contain only class-level string attributes with seemingly random strings; no methods or data processing. No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious operations detected. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of several class definitions inheriting from a custom exception base class. Each class contains a single class attribute with a string value. There are no functions, input/output operations, or data processing logic. The strings appear random and do not indicate any malicious intent. The structure is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious code. Overall, this appears to be benign class declaration code, possibly a placeholder or part of a larger system, but on its own, it shows no malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of class definitions with random string attributes, showing no malicious behavior or security risks. There are no data leaks, backdoors, or suspicious operations. It appears to be harmless, possibly obfuscated or placeholder code.",
