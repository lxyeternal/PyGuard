{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes with seemingly random, obfuscated attribute names and values.",
  "sources": "Class definitions with hardcoded string attributes, no external data input or dynamic data sources.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks or data flow paths; no use of untrusted data or external output.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow present; all data is statically assigned within class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and attribute names, with strings that appear random and meaningless. No apparent functional purpose. Lack of method implementations or data handling logic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions that inherit from a custom exception class. Each subclass contains class-level string attributes with nonsensical, randomly generated values. There are no functions, data processing, network operations, or external interactions. The pattern of class and attribute names appears intentionally obfuscated, possibly to conceal intent, but no malicious behavior or suspicious activities are evident in the static structure. The code does not read input, write output, or perform any actions that could lead to security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be obfuscated, possibly as part of an anti-analysis or concealment tactic, but it does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It solely defines classes with meaningless attributes, with no observable malicious or malicious intent or dangerous activities.",
