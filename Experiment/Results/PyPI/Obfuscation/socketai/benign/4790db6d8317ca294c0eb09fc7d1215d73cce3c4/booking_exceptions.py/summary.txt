  "conclusion": "The code is static, obfuscated class declarations with static string attributes, with no evidence of malicious behavior or active security threats. The obfuscation is superficial, and the code appears benign. Scores in the reports are appropriate, with high obfuscation scores justified by naming patterns, and malware scores correctly low. No active malicious intent is detected, and the overall security risk is minimal."
