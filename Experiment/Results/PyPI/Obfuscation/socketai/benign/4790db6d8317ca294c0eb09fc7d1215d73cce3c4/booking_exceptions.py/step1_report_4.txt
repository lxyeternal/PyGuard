  "purpose": "Define multiple custom exception classes with hardcoded string attributes.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and hardcoded string attributes within classes.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; classes only define constants.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of multiple classes inheriting from Exception with obfuscated class names; all attributes are hardcoded strings, potentially used as secret tokens or keys.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from Exception, each containing a single hardcoded string attribute with seemingly random content. No input handling, data transmission, or executable logic is present. The obfuscated class names and attributes could be an attempt to hide malicious intent, such as storing secrets, backdoors, or cryptographic keys. However, as no functional behavior, data flow, or external communication is implemented, the code itself does not perform any malicious actions. It appears to be intentionally obscured but lacks active malicious components.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily obfuscated class definitions with hardcoded strings; there is no evidence of malicious behavior or malicious intent from the provided fragment. The presence of obfuscated identifiers and static strings warrants cautious review if used in a broader context, but in isolation, it appears benign.",
