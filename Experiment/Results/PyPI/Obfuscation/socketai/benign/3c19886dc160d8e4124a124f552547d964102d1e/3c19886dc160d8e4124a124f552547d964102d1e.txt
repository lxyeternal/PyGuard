Further investigation into the contents of 'utils_www.WWW' and how the imported symbol is used is recommended to assess potential risks."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign web content utility with security concerns mainly about SSL verification bypass. No evidence of malware or malicious payloads is present. The obfuscation is moderate, and the overall security risk is low to moderate. The malware score should remain at 0, with a slightly elevated obfuscation score (~0.4) and a risk score around 0.35 to reflect the SSL bypass vulnerability."
