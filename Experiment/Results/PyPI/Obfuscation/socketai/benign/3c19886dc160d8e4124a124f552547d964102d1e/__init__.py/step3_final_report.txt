  "purpose": "Import an obfuscated symbol from a module, potentially for further use in the application.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no data input or external sources are directly involved.",
  "sinks": "Not applicable in this snippet; no untrusted data handling or output occurs here.",
  "flows": "No data flow is observable within this isolated import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The module path 'utils_www.WWW' and the symbol name 'LuqAHxScOBKzRXfjsQzFZhPpWWUHUQCd' are highly obfuscated, which is suspicious and warrants further investigation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement importing an obfuscated symbol from a module with an unusual name. The high obfuscation suggests potential concealment but does not confirm malicious intent. The lack of further code prevents assessment of actual behavior or malicious activity. The scores assigned across reports—high obfuscation (around 0.7-0.8), low malware likelihood (0.0-0.3), and moderate security risk (0.2-0.4)—are consistent with the evidence. The suspicion is primarily due to obfuscation, which should prompt further review of the imported module's contents and subsequent usage. Overall, the code is minimal and not inherently malicious, but the obfuscation warrants cautious follow-up.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is suspicious due to obfuscation but does not demonstrate malicious activity in isolation. The scores are appropriate given the evidence. Further investigation into the contents of 'utils_www.WWW' and how the imported symbol is used is recommended to assess potential risks.",
