  "conclusion": "The code is a utility for environment inspection and injection, with significant obfuscation and runtime modification capabilities. While no direct malware or malicious payloads are detected, the injection features and obfuscation present security risks if misused. The overall malware score is low (~0.2), but the obfuscation and injection capabilities justify a moderate to high security risk (~0.55). Caution is advised when deploying or sourcing this code in supply chain contexts."
