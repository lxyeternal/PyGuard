{
  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for package distribution with static metadata.",
  "sources": "Static strings defining package name, version, download URL, dependencies, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or input sources are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "Package name appears obfuscated or random; external URL points to GitHub archive, which could be used to obscure malicious content but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with static metadata, conditional import for setuptools or distutils, and no dynamic code execution. The package name's randomness and external URL are noted but do not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation techniques, or suspicious patterns are present. Static analysis confirms no malicious code, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. The package's obfuscated name and external URL warrant caution but are not definitive indicators of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malware or malicious behavior. The obfuscated package name and external URL pose minimal risk but should be monitored. Scores are set to reflect static benign nature: malware=0, obfuscated=0.2–0.3, securityRisk=0.1–0.2.",
