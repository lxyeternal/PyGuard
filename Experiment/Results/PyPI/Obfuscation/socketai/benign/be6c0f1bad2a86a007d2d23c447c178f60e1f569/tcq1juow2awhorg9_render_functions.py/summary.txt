  "conclusion": "The code is a set of rendering utility functions with heavily obfuscated internal identifiers. Despite the obfuscation, there is no evidence of malicious intent or activity. The high obfuscation scores reflect suspicion but do not confirm malicious behavior. The malware score remains at 0, and the security risk is low (~0.2), primarily due to obfuscation. Continued vigilance is recommended, but based on current analysis, the code appears benign."
