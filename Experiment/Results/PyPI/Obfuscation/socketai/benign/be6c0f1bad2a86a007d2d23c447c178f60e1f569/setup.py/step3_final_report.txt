  "purpose": "Enforce Python 3 compatibility before running package setup.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info.major (reads Python version info)",
  "sinks": "RuntimeError (raises error if Python version < 3)",
  "flows": "Version check source (sys.version_info.major) to error raise (RuntimeError), then to setup()",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward version check and setup call",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys and setuptools, checks if the Python major version is less than 3, raises a RuntimeError if so, and proceeds with setup(). No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity detected. The logic is standard for enforcing environment requirements in setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard environment check for Python 3 compatibility in a setup script. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
