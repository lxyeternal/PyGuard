  "purpose": "To ensure the Python environment is version 3 or higher before proceeding with package setup",
  "sources": "sys.version_info.major to check Python version",
  "sinks": "RuntimeError if Python version is less than 3",
  "flows": "sys.version_info.major -> RuntimeError (if version < 3) -> program termination",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version check and setup call",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys and setuptools, performs a Python version check, and raises an error if the version is less than 3, then calls setup(). There are no indications of malicious behavior or malicious code. The version check is a standard practice to prevent incompatibility. No external data or untrusted input is processed beyond the version check. The setup() call is typical for Python packages. The code is minimal and does not include obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a basic environment check and initiates package setup. There is no malicious intent or suspicious activity present. It is a standard, safe script for package configuration.",
