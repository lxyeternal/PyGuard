  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n**Code Review:**\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom setuptools import setup\nif sys.version_info.major < 3:\n    raise RuntimeError(\n        'pangocairocffi does not support Python 2.x. Please use Python 3.')\nsetup()\n```\n- The code imports `sys` and `setuptools.setup`.\n- It checks if the major Python version is less than 3.\n- If so, it raises a `RuntimeError` to prevent installation on Python 2.\n- Otherwise, it proceeds with `setup()`.\n\n**Security and Malicious Behavior Assessment:**\n- The code performs a straightforward version check.\n- No obfuscated or suspicious code is present.\n- The `setup()` invocation is standard for Python package configuration.\n- No external data, secrets, or network activity are involved.\n- The purpose is to enforce Python 3 compatibility, a common practice.\n\n**Review of the Reports:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as a standard version check with no anomalies, malicious activity, or security risks.\n- They correctly identify the purpose, flow, and lack of suspicious behavior.\n- The confidence level is 1 in all reports, which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 in all reports. The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 in all reports. The code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 in all reports. The code enforces a version check with no security implications.\n\n**Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n- Since all reports are consistent and accurate, no adjustments are necessary.\n- The code is typical for package setup scripts and does not warrant a higher risk or malware score.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, transparent version check used in many Python packages to prevent installation on unsupported Python versions. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the detailed review, I agree with the reports' assessments. The scores are appropriate, and no modifications are needed. The code is safe, straightforward, and performs a common compatibility check.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the consensus and the code's nature.",
