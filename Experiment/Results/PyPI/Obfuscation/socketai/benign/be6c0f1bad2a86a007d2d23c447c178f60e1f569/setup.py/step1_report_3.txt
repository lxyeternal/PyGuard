  "purpose": "To enforce Python version compatibility and set up a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Python version info from sys.version_info.",
  "sinks": "The RuntimeError is raised if Python version is less than 3; no other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "From sys.version_info check to potential RuntimeError if the condition is met.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version check and package setup. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys and setuptools, checks the major Python version, and raises an error if the version is below 3. It then calls setup() to configure the package. The logic is simple and intended for environment validation. No malicious or suspicious activities are present. The check is standard practice in package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a basic environment validation for Python version compatibility and initiates package setup. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
