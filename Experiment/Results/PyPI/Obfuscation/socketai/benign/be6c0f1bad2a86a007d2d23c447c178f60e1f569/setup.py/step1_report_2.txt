{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up a Python package, specifically 'pangocairocffi', and enforce Python 3.x compatibility.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Python interpreter version from sys.version_info",
  "sinks": "The code raises a RuntimeError if Python 2.x is detected",
  "flows": "Input source (Python version info) → check condition → raise RuntimeError if condition met",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code performs a straightforward version check and setup invocation",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys and setuptools. It checks if the Python major version is less than 3, and if so, raises a RuntimeError to prevent installation under Python 2. This is a common compatibility enforcement pattern. The setup() function is called unconditionally after the check, which is standard in package setup scripts. There are no hidden or suspicious behaviors, no code injection, and no malicious activity observed.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard package setup script with a Python version check to prevent installation on Python 2.x. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues.",
