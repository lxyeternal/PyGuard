  "conclusion": "The script is a typical FFI setup with obfuscated identifiers, posing minimal inherent risk. The primary concern is external file integrity; if these files are malicious, they could introduce harmful code during compilation. Without validation, there's a potential supply chain risk, but the code itself is not malicious."
