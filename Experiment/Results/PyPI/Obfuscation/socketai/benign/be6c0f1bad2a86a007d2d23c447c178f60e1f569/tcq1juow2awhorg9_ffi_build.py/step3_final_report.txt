  "purpose": "Set up Python bindings for C libraries using cffi by reading external C definitions and compiling an extension module.",
  "sources": "External files 'c_definitions_cairo.txt' and 'c_definitions_pangocairo.txt' read for C definitions.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; external files could contain malicious code if compromised, which would be executed during compilation.",
  "flows": "Read external files -> pass content to cdef() -> compile extension module.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; reliance on external files without validation; no error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard cffi setup: reads external C definitions, includes a precompiled ffi object, and compiles on execution. Obfuscated variable names suggest concealment but are not inherently malicious. The main security concern is the trustworthiness of external files, which could contain malicious C code if tampered with. No network activity or system modifications are present. The malware score is low (around 0.2), reflecting no direct malicious actions in the code. The obfuscation score is high (~0.7), justified by variable naming. The security risk is moderate (~0.4), considering external file trust issues. Proper validation of external files is recommended before use.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical FFI setup with obfuscated identifiers, posing minimal inherent risk. The primary concern is external file integrity; if these files are malicious, they could introduce harmful code during compilation. Without validation, there's a potential supply chain risk, but the code itself is not malicious.",
