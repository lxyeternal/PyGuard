  "conclusion": "The code is benign and performs expected dynamic library loading with fallback. The primary security concern is the use of environment variables, which could be exploited if manipulated, but no malicious intent or activity is evident. The scores assigned in the reports are generally appropriate; the obfuscation score in report 3 is overstated given the code's clarity and should be lowered."
