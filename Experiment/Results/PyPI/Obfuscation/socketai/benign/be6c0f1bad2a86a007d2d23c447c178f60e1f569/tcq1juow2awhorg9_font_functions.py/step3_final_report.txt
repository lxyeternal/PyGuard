  "purpose": "Utility functions for setting and getting resolution and font options on a pangocffi Context object.",
  "sources": "The functions read from the 'context' object and optional external data (e.g., font options).",
  "sinks": "The functions modify the 'context' object; no external data leaks or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "flows": "Functions receive a context, then call underlying library functions to set or get properties; no external data flows or injections identified.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation in variable and attribute names, and import modules with non-descriptive names, which could be an attempt to hide intent but no malicious activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward wrapper functions around pangocffi context methods for setting/getting resolution and font options. Despite obfuscation, there is no evidence of network activity, data exfiltration, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior. The obfuscation may be suspicious but does not necessarily indicate malicious intent. The functions operate solely on the provided context and optional parameters, with no external data leaks or injections. The low malware scores across reports align with this assessment. The high obfuscation score reflects the naming style, which warrants caution but is not conclusive of maliciousness.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign utility functions for graphics context management. The obfuscation is notable but not sufficient evidence of malicious activity. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data flow are present. The current scores—malware=0, obfuscated=0.7, risk=0.2—are appropriate given the evidence.",
