      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard environment check for Python 3 compatibility in a setup script. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior."

      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code is a set of rendering utility functions with heavily obfuscated internal identifiers. Despite the obfuscation, there is no evidence of malicious intent or activity. The high obfuscation scores reflect suspicion but do not confirm malicious behavior. The malware score remains at 0, and the security risk is low (~0.2), primarily due to obfuscation. Continued vigilance is recommended, but based on current analysis, the code appears benign."

      "obfuscated": 0.2,
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is benign and performs expected dynamic library loading with fallback. The primary security concern is the use of environment variables, which could be exploited if manipulated, but no malicious intent or activity is evident. The scores assigned in the reports are generally appropriate; the obfuscation score in report 3 is overstated given the code's clarity and should be lowered."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility module for text rendering with Cairo and Pango. Obfuscation is present but does not currently indicate malicious intent. The supply chain risk is low, though internal modules should be reviewed for further assurance."

      "conclusion": "The script is a typical FFI setup with obfuscated identifiers, posing minimal inherent risk. The primary concern is external file integrity; if these files are malicious, they could introduce harmful code during compilation. Without validation, there's a potential supply chain risk, but the code itself is not malicious."

No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data flow are present. The current scores—malware=0, obfuscated=0.7, risk=0.2—are appropriate given the evidence."
