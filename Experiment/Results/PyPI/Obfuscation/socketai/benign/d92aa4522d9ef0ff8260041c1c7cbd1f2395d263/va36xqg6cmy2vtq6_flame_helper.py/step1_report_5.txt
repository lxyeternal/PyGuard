{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform some data processing or utility functions, but without specific comments or context, the exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from environment variables, file I/O, or function parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes data to files, outputs to console, or sends data over the network.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (input) through processing functions, possibly reaching sinks (output or network).",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious function calls. However, lack of comments and unclear data handling could hide malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code structure shows standard Python practices without evident obfuscation or malicious patterns. No use of unsafe eval, exec, or dynamic code execution detected. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious network calls observed. The only concern is the lack of context and comments, which could hide malicious logic, but based on the visible code, no malicious activity is apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not show clear signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard utility script or module with no suspicious patterns. However, due to the lack of context and comments, a cautious low-confidence stance is advised if malicious intent is suspected.",
