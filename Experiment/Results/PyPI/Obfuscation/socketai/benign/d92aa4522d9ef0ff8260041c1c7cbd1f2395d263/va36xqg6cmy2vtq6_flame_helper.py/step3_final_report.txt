{
  "purpose": "To evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on static analysis reports.",
  "sources": "Input data from five detailed static analysis reports describing code characteristics, suspicious patterns, obfuscation levels, and risk assessments.",
  "sinks": "Potential malicious actions such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful system modifications are considered, but no explicit sinks are identified in the reports.",
  "flows": "The reports connect code complexity and suspicion (sources) with malware suspicion and obfuscation (sinks), with scores reflecting the likelihood of malicious behavior based on observed code features.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation in report 2 (score 0.8), suspicion without confirmed malicious activity, and cautious notes in report 5 due to lack of context. No actual malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "All reports consistently indicate low malware and security risks, with only report 2 showing significant obfuscation and suspicion. Scores align with descriptions: malware scores are mostly zero, obfuscation scores are low except in report 2, and risk scores are generally low. Confidence levels are high for benign assessments, with slight caution in reports noting lack of context. No discrepancies are observed between the reports' claims and their scoring rationale.",
  "conclusion": "The overall assessment indicates the code is benign with minimal obfuscation and low security risk. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the detailed analyses. No adjustments are necessary unless further dynamic or runtime evidence emerges.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.2,
  "malware": 0.0,
  "securityRisk": 0.2,
