  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; all data is static and predefined.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious patterns found. The content is standard metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code is a JSON object containing package metadata such as date, revision ID, version, and a 'dirty' flag. It contains no code execution, data input/output, or dynamic behavior. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or malicious code segments. The static nature and lack of code logic imply low risk.",
  "conclusion": "This is benign metadata with no malicious intent or security concerns detected. It appears to be a straightforward data record.",
