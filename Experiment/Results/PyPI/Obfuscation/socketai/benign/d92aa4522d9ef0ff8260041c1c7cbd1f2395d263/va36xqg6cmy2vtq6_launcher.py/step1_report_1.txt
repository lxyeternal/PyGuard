{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for basic data processing or utility functions, but without specific context, the exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from standard input or variables initialized within the code; no external input sources are explicitly shown.",
  "sinks": "Data is output to standard output, logs, or stored in variables; no external network calls or file writes are evident from the provided code.",
  "flows": "The code processes input data through internal variables and functions, with no evident untrusted data flow leading to sensitive sinks such as network or file systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual language features are detected. No malicious behaviors like code injection or backdoors are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, using standard Python constructs. No suspicious imports, code execution functions, or network operations are present. It does not appear to contain malicious or maliciously obfuscated logic. The structure suggests it performs simple data manipulation or calculations, with no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no indication of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code seems benign and straightforward. Confidence in this assessment is high, given the lack of suspicious elements.",
