  "purpose": "This code appears to be a simple utility to fetch and display the current weather information based on user input.",
  "sources": "User input for location via input() function, and possibly environment variables if used (not shown in provided code).",
  "sinks": "Print statements displaying weather data; potential logging if present (not shown).",
  "flows": "User input is processed and used to fetch data from an external weather API, then output to the console.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious network connections detected.",
  "analysis": "The code takes user input for location, constructs an API request URL, fetches weather data, and displays it. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. The code is straightforward and utilizes standard libraries. No unusual or obfuscated code structures are present. There are no hidden network communications or malicious logic observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, designed for weather data retrieval without malicious intent. It does not contain any suspicious or malicious behaviors.",
