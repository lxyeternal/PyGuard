{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform some data processing or utility functions, but the specific purpose is not explicitly clear due to lack of context or comments.",
  "sources": "Potential data input sources are not clearly defined; the code does not show explicit data reading or input handling, suggesting reliance on function parameters or environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, network communications, or data writes, but none are explicitly visible. The code does not show suspicious data leakage points or dangerous operations.",
  "flows": "There are no evident source-to-sink data flows indicating malicious activity. The flow of data within functions appears normal and limited to local variables.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, unusual variable names, or obfuscated code are present. The code lacks comments and documentation, which could be considered a minimal security concern but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard Python functions and logic without suspicious imports, unsafe code patterns, or malicious behavior indicators. No external data inputs or network activities are observable. The absence of sensitive operations or hardcoded secrets reduces concern. The structure is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious control flow. Overall, the code appears benign based on the provided snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard, non-malicious Python script with no evidence of sabotage or malware.",
