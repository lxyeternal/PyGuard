  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, network modules, cryptography modules, dynamic code execution points, variable names, data handling functions.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file operations, environment variable access, cryptographic functions, potential data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or code inputs to sinks like network modules or file outputs, possibly involving dynamic execution functions.",
  "anomalies": "Potential dynamic code execution (eval/exec), obfuscated variable names, complex logic without documentation, hardcoded secrets, suspicious import patterns.",
  "analysis": "The reports indicate that code snippets are either absent or contain suspicious features such as dynamic execution, obfuscation, or complex logic. Scores assigned (malware=0.2, obfuscated=0.4, risk=0.4) are consistent with suspicion but lack definitive malicious activity. The absence of explicit malicious functions or hardcoded secrets justifies low malware scores. Moderate suspicion of obfuscation and dynamic behavior supports the current scores. Overall, the assessments are aligned with the evidence, and no significant adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits some suspicious features like potential obfuscation and dynamic execution, but no concrete malicious activity is confirmed. The current security scores are appropriate and reflect a moderate threat level. Continuous monitoring is advised if more code details emerge.",
