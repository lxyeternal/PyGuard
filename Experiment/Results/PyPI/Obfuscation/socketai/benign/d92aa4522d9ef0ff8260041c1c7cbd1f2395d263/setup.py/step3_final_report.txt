  "purpose": "To evaluate supply chain security of an open source Python dependency by analyzing provided code snippets or reports for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Input data, code snippets, or reports indicating code presence or absence.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network connections, or malicious actions triggered by code execution.",
  "flows": "Data input sources to sinks via code logic, including suspicious patterns or anomalies.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, obfuscated code, or unusual control flow.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate no code or minimal code, with appropriate assessments and low scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The confidence levels are generally aligned with the amount of information; the only inconsistency is Report 3's high confidence despite no code being present, which should be lowered. The reasoning across reports is cautious and consistent, with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores reflect the lack of suspicious findings, and no adjustments are necessary except for the confidence in Report 3.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided reports, the dependency shows no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scoring is appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at zero and minimal security risk. The only improvement is adjusting Report 3's confidence score from 0.9 to around 0.5 to better reflect the absence of code. Overall, the assessments are consistent and justified.",
