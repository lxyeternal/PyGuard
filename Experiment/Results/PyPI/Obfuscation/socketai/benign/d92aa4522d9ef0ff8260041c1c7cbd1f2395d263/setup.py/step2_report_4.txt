  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- No code provided; all fields indicate absence of code.\n- The conclusion correctly states that no assessment can be made.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate given no code.\n- No issues here; the report is consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- The report suggests the code appears benign, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- Confidence is 0.4, indicating some uncertainty due to minimal code.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — aligns with the assessment.\n- Since no code is provided, the low confidence and low risk seem appropriate.\n- No issues here; the reasoning is sound.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- No code provided; high confidence (0.9) due to absence of code.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- The conclusion that no malicious behavior can be assessed is correct.\n- No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Slightly more detailed, mentioning potential data sources and sinks, but still no code.\n- Confidence is 0.3, reflecting limited information.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — reasonable.\n- The reasoning is cautious and appropriate given the lack of code.\n- No issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- No code provided; the report emphasizes the need for actual code for analysis.\n- Confidence is 0, indicating complete uncertainty.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- The conclusion correctly states that no assessment can be made.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of observations:\n- All reports correctly acknowledge the absence of code and refrain from making unwarranted claims.\n- Scores are consistent with the level of information provided.\n- No report claims or implies malicious behavior without evidence.\n- The reasoning in each report is cautious and appropriate.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- Since no code is provided in any report, the malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.\n- Security risk scores are appropriately low, reflecting no evidence of issues.\n- Confidence scores are correctly set based on the amount of information.\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the absence of code, I agree with the current scores and conclusions across all reports. There is no basis to adjust the malware, obfuscated, or risk scores.\n\n**Overall estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and reasonable. Without code, no malicious or obfuscation concerns can be identified.",
