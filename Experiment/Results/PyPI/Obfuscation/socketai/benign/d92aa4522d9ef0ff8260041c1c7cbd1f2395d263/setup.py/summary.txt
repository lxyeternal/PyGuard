  "conclusion": "Based on the provided reports, the dependency shows no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scoring is appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at zero and minimal security risk. The only improvement is adjusting Report 3's confidence score from 0.9 to around 0.5 to better reflect the absence of code. Overall, the assessments are consistent and justified."
