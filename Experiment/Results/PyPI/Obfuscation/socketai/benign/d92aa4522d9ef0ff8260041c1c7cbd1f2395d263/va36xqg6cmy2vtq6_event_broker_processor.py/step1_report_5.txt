  "purpose": "Process events from Celery into a flame data model for downstream analytics or processing.",
  "sources": "The event parameter passed into the function, which is a dictionary containing event data.",
  "sinks": "The downstream system or storage where the processed flame data model is sent or stored.",
  "flows": "Event data is received from the input parameter, processed into the flame data model, and then sent downstream.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code is straightforward and does not perform any network operations or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet is a minimal description of a function intended to process Celery events into a flame data model. It only defines a function with a parameter and a comment describing its purpose. There are no apparent data handling, security-sensitive operations, or suspicious behaviors. The code does not contain obfuscated patterns or malicious payloads. It appears to be a standard, benign function stub intended for event processing.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a simple, benign placeholder or function definition for processing Celery events into a data model. There are no signs of malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks in this fragment.",
