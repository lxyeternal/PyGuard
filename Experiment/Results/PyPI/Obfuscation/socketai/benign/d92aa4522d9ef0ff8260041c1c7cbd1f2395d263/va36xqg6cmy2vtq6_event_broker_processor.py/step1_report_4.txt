  "purpose": "Process events from Celery into flame data model.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'event' (dict) passed to the function",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks identified; potential data processing or transmission not shown",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'event' input through processing into the flame data model, but details are missing",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs observed; code is minimal and straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code snippet is a brief function header with a docstring explaining its purpose and arguments. It does not contain any logic, external calls, or data handling beyond the argument description. Due to the limited content, no suspicious behavior or malicious intent can be inferred. The code appears to be a simple placeholder or documentation comment for a function that processes events from Celery.",
  "conclusion": "There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in the provided code fragment. It is a standard function documentation snippet with no embedded malicious logic or suspicious patterns.",
