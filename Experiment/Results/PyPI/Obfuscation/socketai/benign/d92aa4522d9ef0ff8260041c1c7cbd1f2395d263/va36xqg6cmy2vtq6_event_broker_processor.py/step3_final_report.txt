  "purpose": "Process events from Celery into flame data model.",
  "sources": "The function signature and comments indicating input event data; no actual data reading code provided.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, external calls, or data leaks evident; no sinks identified.",
  "flows": "No actual implementation, so no source-to-sink data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of implementation details; only placeholder comments and signatures; no suspicious code, obfuscation, or secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal placeholder with no logic, external calls, or suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify the lack of implementation and malicious indicators. Malware scores are appropriately zero, security risks are minimal, and confidence levels are high given the limited information. No anomalies or obfuscation are present. The overall assessment indicates a benign, non-malicious placeholder function.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are justified and consistent with the minimal, non-implemented code snippets. No adjustments are necessary; the code is benign and poses minimal security risk.",
