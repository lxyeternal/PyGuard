  "purpose": "Process events from Celery into flame data model for downstream consumption.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'event' (dict), likely from external Celery worker process.",
  "sinks": "Potentially downstream systems consuming processed data or sending data elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Event data received -> processing/aggregation -> downstream transmission or storage.",
  "anomalies": "No code provided; only a function signature and comments. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic visible.",
  "analysis": "The provided code snippet is a function definition with a comment explaining its purpose. It lacks implementation details, external calls, or any behavior that could indicate malicious activity. Without additional code, there are no signs of embedded malware, malicious data handling, or security issues. The structure appears standard for event processing functions.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a standard event processing stub with no suspicious elements.",
