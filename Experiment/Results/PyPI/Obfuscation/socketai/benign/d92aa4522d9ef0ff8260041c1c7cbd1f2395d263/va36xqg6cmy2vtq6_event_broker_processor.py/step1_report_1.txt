  "sinks": "Potential data storage or transmission points where processed data is sent downstream.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'event' input through aggregation logic into downstream systems.",
  "anomalies": "No code shown; no hardcoded credentials, suspicious logic, or obfuscated code identified.",
  "analysis": "The provided code snippet is a simple function definition with a descriptive comment. It indicates processing an event dictionary from Celery to a data model but lacks implementation details. There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious data handling, or security risks within the visible code. No hardcoded secrets, external calls, or unusual operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the limited code provided, there is no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. The code appears to be a standard data processing function with no malicious intent.",
