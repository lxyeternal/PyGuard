  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and unsafe practices, focusing on source-to-sink data flows and anomalies.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, file inputs, untrusted user inputs, code snippets using eval() and exec()",
  "sinks": "Dynamic code execution functions (eval(), exec()), environment variables, file outputs, network connections (if any), data leaks",
  "flows": "Untrusted input → eval()/exec() → potential code execution or data leakage",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval() and exec() on untrusted data, potential obfuscation via dynamic code execution, absence of code in some reports, inconsistent scoring of risk levels",
  "analysis": "Reports 1 and 2 lack code, correctly assigned zero scores. Report 3 identifies unsafe eval()/exec() usage, which is dangerous but not confirmed malicious; scores are mostly appropriate but malware score should be increased from 0 to about 0.4 to reflect high risk. Reports 4 and 5 show benign code with no suspicious patterns, with high confidence scores and low risk. The main concern is unsafe dynamic code execution practices in Report 3, which pose significant security risks but do not constitute active malware. The scoring in the reports aligns with the described behaviors, but adjusting the malware score in Report 3 better captures the potential threat.",
  "conclusion": "Most reports are accurate; the primary issue is unsafe eval()/exec() usage in Report 3, warranting a higher malware risk score. No active malware or obfuscation detected. Overall, the dependency appears benign with moderate risk due to unsafe practices.",
