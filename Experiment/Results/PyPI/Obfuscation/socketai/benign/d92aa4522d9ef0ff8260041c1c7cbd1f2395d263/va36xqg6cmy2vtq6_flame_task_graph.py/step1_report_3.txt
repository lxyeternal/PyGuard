  "purpose": "The code appears to be a comment or documentation explaining the handling of task states in a system, specifically how incomplete tasks are represented to the UI after ungraceful termination.",
  "sources": "No data input sources are present in this snippet; it is purely a comment explaining system behavior.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or points where untrusted data could leak or cause effects; it is only descriptive text.",
  "flows": "No actual code execution flow, as this is a comment or docstring, so no source-to-sink data flow exists.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a comment; no anomalies, malicious code, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The snippet is a comment explaining how the system manages task states after ungraceful termination, introducing a fake 'task-incomplete' runstate for UI purposes. There is no executable code, no data processing, and no suspicious or malicious logic present. It is purely descriptive documentation.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign comment or docstring explaining internal system behavior with no malicious intent or security issues detected.",
