  "sources": "Comment describing the runstate assignment; return statement indicating function completion.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "Comment provides context; return indicates function end; no data flow or execution beyond that.",
  "anomalies": "Purely a comment with no executable logic; no anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet is a comment explaining the creation of a fake runstate for UI purposes, followed by a return statement. It contains no executable logic, data handling, or external interactions. The code is benign, serving as documentation or a placeholder. No security issues, malware, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, securityRisk≈0.1, confidence≈0.9) are appropriate given the benign nature of the snippet. The content does not suggest malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign comment with a return statement, serving as documentation. No malicious activity, security risks, or obfuscation are present. The scores are accurate and consistent with the code's nature. No adjustments are necessary.",
