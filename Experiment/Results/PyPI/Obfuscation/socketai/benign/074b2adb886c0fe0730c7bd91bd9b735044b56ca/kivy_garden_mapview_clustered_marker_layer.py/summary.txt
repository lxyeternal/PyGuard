  "conclusion": "The code is a complex, obfuscated spatial clustering utility with no evidence of malware or malicious behavior. The high obfuscation score is justified, but the malware score remains at 0 due to lack of malicious indicators. The security risk is low. Continuous monitoring is recommended to detect any runtime malicious activity, but static analysis suggests the code is benign."
