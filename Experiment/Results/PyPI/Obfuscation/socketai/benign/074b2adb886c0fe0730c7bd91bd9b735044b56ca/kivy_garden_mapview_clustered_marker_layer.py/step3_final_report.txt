{
  "purpose": "The code implements spatial data handling, clustering, and map visualization using obfuscated class and function names; no malicious behavior or network activity is evident.",
  "sources": "The code reads input points, user interactions, and spatial data from internal structures and modules.",
  "sinks": "No external data exfiltration, network communication, or system modifications are present; data flows within spatial processing and visualization functions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input points through spatial calculations, recursive clustering functions, and into map markers and visualizations.",
  "anomalies": "Suspiciously obfuscated class and function names, cryptic import attributes, placeholder icon paths, and complex recursive spatial functions suggest concealment but no direct malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code performs spatial clustering and map visualization with heavy obfuscation, which could be intended to conceal proprietary algorithms or malicious payloads. No network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications are detected. The obfuscation is significant but not conclusive of malicious intent. The code's purpose appears benign, but the obfuscation warrants cautious review.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a complex, obfuscated spatial clustering utility with no evidence of malware or malicious behavior. The high obfuscation score is justified, but the malware score remains at 0 due to lack of malicious indicators. The security risk is low. Continuous monitoring is recommended to detect any runtime malicious activity, but static analysis suggests the code is benign.",
