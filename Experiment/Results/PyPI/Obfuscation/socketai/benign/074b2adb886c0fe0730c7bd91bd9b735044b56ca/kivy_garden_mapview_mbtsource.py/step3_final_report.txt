  "purpose": "Implementing a local SQLite-based map tile source that retrieves and renders map tiles from a database.",
  "sources": "Database queries fetching tile data and metadata, reading from SQLite database, and image data extraction.",
  "sinks": "Image rendering via CoreImage, setting texture on map tile objects.",
  "flows": "Database query retrieves tile data → data converted into image → image assigned to map tile object.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation in module and class names, use of thread-local storage for database connections, minimal error handling, obfuscated import names.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard operations for a local map tile provider: reading metadata, fetching tile data from a SQLite database, converting binary data into images, and rendering. No network activity, credential handling, or data exfiltration is present. Obfuscation appears to be an attempt to conceal purpose rather than malicious activity. The use of thread-local storage for database connections is a common pattern to avoid concurrency issues. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious data flows are detected. The high obfuscation scores are justified by the naming patterns, but do not imply malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, obfuscated implementation of a local SQLite map tile source. Despite heavy obfuscation, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not indicate malicious intent.",
