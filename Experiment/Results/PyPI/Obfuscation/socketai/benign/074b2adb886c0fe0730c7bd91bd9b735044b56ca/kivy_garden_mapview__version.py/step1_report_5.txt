  "purpose": "The code assigns a version string to a variable.",
  "sources": "Assignment to variable 'pHDoKMEcLSZEsKwIfBzLPqixOBzIKYvL'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Variable name is obfuscated and non-descriptive; only contains a version string, no other logic or behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a string '1.0.6' to a variable with an obfuscated name. There are no indications of input, data processing, or external communication. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. The variable naming suggests obfuscation but does not necessarily indicate malicious intent. No complex logic, network operations, or other typical malware indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward version assignment with obfuscated variable naming. It does not exhibit any malicious or suspicious behavior based on this fragment.",
