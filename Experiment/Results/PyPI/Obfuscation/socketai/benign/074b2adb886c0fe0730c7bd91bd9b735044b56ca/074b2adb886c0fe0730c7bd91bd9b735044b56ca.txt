      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a typical package setup script with obfuscation and a standard pattern for version loading. No evidence of malicious activity or malware. The primary security concern is the use of 'exec' on a local file, which should be managed carefully to prevent tampering. The overall security risk is low, with a malware score of 0, obfuscation around 0.7, and a moderate risk score (~0.3)."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign setup script with obfuscation that warrants caution. No direct malicious activity is evident, but the suspicious import pattern and obfuscated variable name justify further review. The assigned scores of malware 0.2, obfuscated 0.7, and risk 0.3 are consistent with the analysis."

      "conclusion": "The code is a complex, obfuscated spatial clustering utility with no evidence of malware or malicious behavior. The high obfuscation score is justified, but the malware score remains at 0 due to lack of malicious indicators. The security risk is low. Continuous monitoring is recommended to detect any runtime malicious activity, but static analysis suggests the code is benign."

The malware score is 0, the obfuscated score is high (~0.8), and the security risk score is low (~0.2). Further investigation should focus on the origin of the obfuscated names and the context within the larger application."

While no active malicious payloads are confirmed, the combination of obfuscation and external URL invocation warrants caution. Further validation of URL sources and inputs is recommended before deployment or trust."

While suspicious, it does not conclusively demonstrate malicious activity. The main concern is the external network call, which could be exploited if inputs are manipulated. The obfuscation and dynamic URL generation increase suspicion but are not definitive proof of malicious intent. Further dynamic analysis and validation of external method behavior are recommended before deployment."

The obfuscation is likely for concealment rather than malicious intent. The assigned malware score is 0, security risk score is low (~0.2), and obfuscation score is high (~0.75), all consistent with the analysis."
