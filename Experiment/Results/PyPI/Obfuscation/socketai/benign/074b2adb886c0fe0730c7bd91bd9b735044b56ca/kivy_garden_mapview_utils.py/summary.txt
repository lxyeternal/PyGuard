  "conclusion": "The code consists of legitimate geographic utility functions with obfuscated identifiers. No evidence of malicious activity or security threats is present. The obfuscation is likely for concealment rather than malicious intent. The assigned malware score is 0, security risk score is low (~0.2), and obfuscation score is high (~0.75), all consistent with the analysis."
