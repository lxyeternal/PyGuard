  "purpose": "Geographic utility functions for clamping values, calculating haversine distance, and estimating map zoom levels based on radius.",
  "sources": "Function parameters, window metrics (e.g., Window.YHyooizfkaiQDVCecGZPvxNGVAXSZbAw), standard math libraries.",
  "sinks": "No external data transmission, file I/O, or network activity; calculations are self-contained.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow through mathematical formulas to produce distance and zoom level outputs.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with nonsensical function and variable names; no malicious code or suspicious operations detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard geographic calculations: a clamp function, haversine distance, and zoom level estimation. Obfuscation appears intentional to hinder readability but does not indicate malicious intent. No external data leaks, network activity, or credential handling are present. The functions are correctly implemented and serve legitimate purposes. The obfuscation increases difficulty in analysis but does not correlate with malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists of legitimate geographic utility functions with obfuscated identifiers. No evidence of malicious activity or security threats is present. The obfuscation is likely for concealment rather than malicious intent. The assigned malware score is 0, security risk score is low (~0.2), and obfuscation score is high (~0.75), all consistent with the analysis.",
