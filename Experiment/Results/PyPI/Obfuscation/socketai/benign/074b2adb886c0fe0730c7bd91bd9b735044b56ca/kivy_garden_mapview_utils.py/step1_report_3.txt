  "purpose": "The code provides geographic calculations including clamping values, calculating haversine distance, and determining zoom levels based on radius, likely for mapping or geolocation purposes.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include function parameters: GQkGbVtRxzQPBsUwosxGOwPaPlczujtW, minimum, maximum, gDuiECQfMQKpAugrHykFrGgDVTLbVDqZ, EwoquisVioJBhyNqodKcjWumRDMCylEB, GmsMzOlTxyPvemYcBamUastsSpuWlRSD, JOKUpXEKStTZvtusQHvoOUgATBfNIrCh, radius_km, UViVnpkANukRJLHBsWyTVlbHjUJcQcCS, OnFcndvkilEdYNgHlEgMFuhBCKqQvFAu.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any obvious sinks such as network transmission, file writing, or system command execution, which could be used maliciously. It primarily performs calculations using inputs.",
  "flows": "Inputs are processed through mathematical functions and then used in calculations for distance and zoom level; no data flows to external systems or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Variable and function names are nonsensical and obfuscated, indicating potential attempt at concealment. The functions perform geographic calculations with no apparent malicious intent. The while loop involves a complex condition that may serve to obscure logic but appears to be part of a zoom level calculation. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports mathematical functions and uses them for geographic computations, such as haversine distance and zoom level determination. The function pJmORjUBKwRlebvWNLctPYYbbefPrgTl clamps a value between minimum and maximum, straightforward and benign. The function cmClrGGyxZywznhZoCtPElVNczrGQdqb calculates haversine distance between two points; it correctly uses radians and spherical trigonometry. The function yMvvUsibdSIwnYmoWbUXmFPCRJsXDVOF computes a zoom level based on radius and map view parameters, with an iterative loop to determine an appropriate zoom level, likely for map rendering. All functions utilize standard mathematical and library functions without suspicious operations or network calls. The variable names are intentionally obfuscated, but the logic appears benign, focused solely on geographic calculations.",
  "conclusion": "There is no evidence of malicious behavior or malware in this code. It performs legitimate geographic calculations with no external data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful operations. The obfuscated names suggest an attempt to conceal, but the code's functionality remains benign and aligned with mapping or geolocation tasks.",
