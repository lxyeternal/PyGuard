{
  "purpose": "The code provides geographic calculations, including clamping values, calculating haversine distances, and determining map zoom levels based on radius.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are the function parameters, environment variables (via Window and dp), and module imports.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include calculations that use external window dimensions and environment-dependent metrics, but no direct data leaks or untrusted data effects are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function inputs into calculations; no untrusted or external data flows into sensitive operations or network calls.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function names (e.g., pJmORjUBKwRlebvWNLctPYYbbefPrgTl, cmClrGGyxZywznhZoCtPElVNczrGQdqb, yMvvUsibdSIwnYmoWbUXmFPCRJsXDVOF) suggest deliberate obfuscation; no hardcoded credentials or malicious code is present. The code performs standard geographic calculations.",
  "analysis": "The code contains three main functions: one for clamping a value within min and max, one for computing haversine distance between two geographic points, and one for calculating map zoom levels based on radius. All functions use standard math and Kivy libraries. The obfuscated function names and variable names seem intentionally obscure, but their logic is consistent with legitimate geographic computations. There are no network operations, data exfiltration, or suspicious behaviors. The use of Window metrics is standard for GUI-related calculations. No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate geographic utility functions with obfuscated names, likely for internal use within a mapping or GIS application. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
