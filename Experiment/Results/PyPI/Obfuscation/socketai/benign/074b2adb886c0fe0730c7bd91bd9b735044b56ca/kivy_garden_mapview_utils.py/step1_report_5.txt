{
  "purpose": "The code provides geographic calculations such as clamping values, computing haversine distances, and determining zoom levels based on radius, likely for mapping or geospatial visualization purposes.",
  "sources": "Input data includes function parameters for geographic coordinates, radii, and window size (via kivy). No explicit external data sources or untrusted inputs are detected beyond function arguments.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include calculations involving untrusted input parameters, but no data leaks, network transmissions, or system modifications are directly present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow through mathematical functions, notably in haversine and zoom level calculations, but no untrusted data reaches external systems or sensitive areas.",
  "anomalies": "Function names are obfuscated or nonsensical, e.g., pJmORjUBKwRlebvWNLctPYYbbefPrgTl, cmClrGGyxZywznhZoCtPElVNczrGQdqb, yMvvUsibdSIwnYmoWbUXmFPCRJsXDVOF, which do not describe their purposes clearly. The code employs complex, unreadable variable names and unnecessary bit shifting in the while loop condition. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. The obfuscation appears intentional but is not malicious per se. The use of a while loop with bit shifts to compute zoom levels is unusual but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code contains functions for geospatial calculations: 'clamp' (limits values between min and max), 'haversine' (calculates great-circle distance), and 'get_zoom_for_radius' (estimates map zoom levels based on radius). The variable names are intentionally obfuscated, reducing clarity but not indicating malicious intent. No external data transmission, credential handling, or system modifications are present. The code does not perform any malicious actions like data exfiltration, system access, or network communication. The obfuscation might hinder maintenance but does not suggest malicious behavior. The control flow appears consistent with its purpose, with no suspicious patterns or anomalies beyond obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is obfuscated but appears to implement legitimate geospatial calculations with no malicious behavior detected. The unusual naming and complexity seem intended to obscure the code's purpose but do not indicate malicious intent or security risks. No signs of malware or security threats are present.",
