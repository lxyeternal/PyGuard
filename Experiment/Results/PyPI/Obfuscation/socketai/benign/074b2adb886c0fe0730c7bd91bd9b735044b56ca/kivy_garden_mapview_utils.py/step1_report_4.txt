{
  "purpose": "The code provides geographic calculations, including distance and zoom level computations, likely for map or spatial analysis within an application.",
  "sources": "The code reads constants and variables related to window dimensions and geographic coordinates, including inputs for radius, latitude, and longitude.",
  "sinks": "The code performs calculations without any data output or network transmission; no evident sinks that could leak data or cause harm.",
  "flows": "Input parameters such as radius and latitude are processed through mathematical functions to compute distances and zoom levels; no untrusted data flows to external systems or malicious sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains highly obfuscated function names and variable names, which may hinder readability and understanding. The use of bit-shifting and complex calculations in yMvvUsibdSIwnYmoWbUXmFPCRJsXDVOF is unusual but consistent with geographic computations.",
  "analysis": "The initial functions clamp values and perform geographic distance calculations using haversine formula components. The obfuscated function names and variable names obscure intent but do not necessarily indicate malicious behavior. The yMvvUsibdSIwnYmoWbUXmFPCRJsXDVOF function calculates an appropriate zoom level based on radius and window size, which is typical for map applications. There are no network operations, file I/O, or credential handling. The code does not include any suspicious data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious commands.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate geographic utility for map zoom calculations. Despite obfuscated naming, there are no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The primary concern is readability rather than security threats.",
