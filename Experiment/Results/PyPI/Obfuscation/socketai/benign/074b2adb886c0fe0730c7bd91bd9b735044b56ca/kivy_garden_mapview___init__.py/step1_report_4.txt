{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be importing modules and components related to the kivy_garden.mapview package, likely for map visualization and interaction.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing modules and classes from kivy_garden.mapview.source, .types, and .view.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks such as network connections, file writes, or eval/exec functions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; only module imports are shown.",
  "anomalies": "The imported module and class names are nonsensical and appear to be obfuscated or randomly generated, which is unusual. No other suspicious activity or hardcoded credentials are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and an __all__ declaration, with no executable logic or data handling. The import names are non-descriptive and appear randomly generated, which can be an indicator of obfuscation or malicious intent. However, without additional context or code, it is difficult to determine malicious behavior solely from these import statements.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code does not show any malicious behavior or security risks in isolation. The obfuscated import names are suspicious but not necessarily malicious. Overall, there is no evidence of malware or security issues based solely on these imports.",
  "confidence": 0.5,
