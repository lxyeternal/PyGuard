  "conclusion": "The primary concern is the URL opening capability in an obfuscated class, which could be exploited if URLs are untrusted. While no active malicious payloads are confirmed, the combination of obfuscation and external URL invocation warrants caution. Further validation of URL sources and inputs is recommended before deployment or trust."
