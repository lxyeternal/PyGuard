  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package setup script with obfuscation and a standard pattern for version loading. No evidence of malicious activity or malware. The primary security concern is the use of 'exec' on a local file, which should be managed carefully to prevent tampering. The overall security risk is low, with a malware score of 0, obfuscation around 0.7, and a moderate risk score (~0.3)."
