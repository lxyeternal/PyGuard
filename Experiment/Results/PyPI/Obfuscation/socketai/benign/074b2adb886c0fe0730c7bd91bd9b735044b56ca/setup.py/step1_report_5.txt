{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package, specifically for the 'kivy_garden.mapview' project. It reads package version info, description, and metadata, then executes the setup process.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from '_version.py', reads README.md for long description, and gathers metadata variables within the script.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function call uses the gathered metadata; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks that could cause harm.",
  "flows": "Version info and metadata are sourced from files; then passed directly into setup() without untrusted data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'exec' to execute the contents of '_version.py' is noteworthy but common for version retrieval; no other unusual code or secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles package setup: it reads the version info via 'exec' on a '_version.py' file, reads the README, and prepares package metadata. The 'exec' usage is a typical pattern for dynamic version extraction in setup scripts, not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials, network calls, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code structure is straightforward, with variable names obfuscated but consistent with typical obfuscation for internal variables. No code appears to be executing external untrusted input or performing unsafe operations.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard Python package setup script with no evidence of malicious behavior. The use of 'exec' on a version file is common and not suspicious here. No malware signals or security risks are detected based on this code.",
