{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to set up and configure a Python package named 'kivy_garden.mapview' for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from '_version.py', reading README.md, and configuration data within the script.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the setup() function with package metadata, which does not directly lead to malicious behavior.",
  "flows": "Reading version info and README content -> configuring package metadata -> calling setup() to prepare package distribution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names, dynamic code execution with 'exec(compile(...))' to load version info, and the execution of setup() in a function called only in main block. No direct malicious activity like network connections, data exfiltration, or system modification is observed. The code appears intentionally obscured but does not contain malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily reads package version info from an external file and reads README content, both standard for setup scripts. Obfuscated variable names and the use of 'exec' to execute the contents of '_version.py' are unusual but not inherently malicious; they could be for obfuscation or to dynamically load version data. No network activity, credential handling, or suspicious system modifications are present. The setup() function is called only if the script runs as the main program, which is typical for distribution scripts. There is no indication of malicious behavior such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious code injection.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration with obfuscated variable names and dynamic execution for loading version data. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided code. The obfuscation appears to be a style choice rather than malicious intent.",
