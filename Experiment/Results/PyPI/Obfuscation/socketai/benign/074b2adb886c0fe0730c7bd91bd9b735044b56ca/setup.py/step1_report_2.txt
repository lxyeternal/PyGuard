{
  "purpose": "This script is designed to prepare and execute the setup of a Python package named 'kivy_garden.mapview' using setuptools. It reads version information from a version file, includes package data, and defines metadata for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from '_version.py'; reading README.md file; importing functions from setuptools; defining package metadata and data; defining a setup invocation.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function call, which executes during package installation, could be a sink if it were manipulated with untrusted input, but here it appears to be static.",
  "flows": "Version info and package data are sourced from local files; metadata is assembled into a dictionary; setup() is called with this data, completing the package build process.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names throughout the script (e.g., WBlhpwfvZeCMeqWFTSKHJbejapiDYtjz), but no suspicious dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration is present. The code appears to be a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names which could be for concealment but are not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing necessary modules and defining file paths with obfuscated variable names. It reads version info from a local '_version.py' file and the README.md for long description. Package metadata and data are stored in a dictionary with obfuscated keys. The setup() function is called with this data within a wrapper function, which is invoked if the script runs as main. No external data sources, network calls, or dynamic code execution are present. The obfuscation seems solely to conceal variable names, not to perform malicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python setup script with obfuscated variable names. It performs no malicious actions, contains no malware indicators, and poses no evident security risks. The obfuscation appears to be solely for concealment, not malicious intent.",
