  "purpose": "Setup configuration script for the 'kivy_garden.mapview' Python package, loading version info and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads '_version.py' for version info, 'README.md' for description, and package files for setup.",
  "sinks": "Calls setup() with package metadata; no untrusted data sinks or external resource access.",
  "flows": "Reads files, executes '_version.py' code via 'exec(compile())', then passes data to setup().",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of variable names; use of 'exec(compile())' to load version info from a local file.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py with obfuscated variable names and uses 'exec' to load version info, which is common but introduces a potential security risk if '_version.py' is compromised. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code is present. The obfuscation appears stylistic. The main concern is the 'exec' pattern, which could be exploited if the version file is maliciously altered. Overall, the code is benign but warrants caution regarding the integrity of '_version.py'.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package setup script with obfuscation and a standard pattern for version loading. No evidence of malicious activity or malware. The primary security concern is the use of 'exec' on a local file, which should be managed carefully to prevent tampering. The overall security risk is low, with a malware score of 0, obfuscation around 0.7, and a moderate risk score (~0.3).",
