  "flows": "Import -> Access variable -> Update the variable with package info -> Call setup with updated data.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable name 'fpJMXxfmoKkhUgFmBwjKWwBhEpcqXAYr' which appears to be random or obfuscated; no explicit malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setup' from setuptools and attempts to import a variable 'fpJMXxfmoKkhUgFmBwjKWwBhEpcqXAYr' from a module named 'setup'. The variable name is non-descriptive, suggesting possible obfuscation. The script updates this variable with package metadata, then calls 'setup' with it. There is no direct evidence of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, network connections, or code injection. The variable name might be an attempt to evade detection or obfuscate intentions, but there is no clear malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard setup script with obfuscated variable naming. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident from this fragment. The unusual variable name warrants cautious review in the broader context, but based solely on this code, it is likely benign.",
