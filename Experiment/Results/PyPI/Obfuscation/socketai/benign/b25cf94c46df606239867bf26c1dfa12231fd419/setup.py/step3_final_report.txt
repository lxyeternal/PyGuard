  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging a module, reading 'README.md' and configuring package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file; defining package parameters such as name, version, modules, classifiers, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network calls, data leaks, or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' into a variable, passing parameters to setup() without further data flow concerns.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names (e.g., 'MIGGcXuuvEhjFCHtEUPYhXYTsMWOqIhB'); 'requests' dependency declared but unused; no malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with obfuscated variable names, which could be stylistic or superficial. No malicious behavior such as network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration is evident. The obfuscation is superficial and does not impact functionality. The declared dependency 'requests' is unused, which is benign but slightly unusual. The overall structure is standard, and no security issues are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign setup script with superficial obfuscation. No malicious activity or security risks are detected. The obfuscation is suspicious but not malicious in itself. The malware score remains at 0, and the overall security risk is very low.",
