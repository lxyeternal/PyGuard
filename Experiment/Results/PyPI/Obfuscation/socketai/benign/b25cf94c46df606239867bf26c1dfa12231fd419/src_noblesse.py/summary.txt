  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential, capable of sabotage, data exfiltration, and abuse of Discord services. Its obfuscation and destructive functions justify high malware (0.85) and risk (0.9) scores. Variable naming and high Unicode generation suggest obfuscation but not necessarily advanced encryption. Overall, this code should be considered highly malicious and dangerous if encountered in a real environment."
