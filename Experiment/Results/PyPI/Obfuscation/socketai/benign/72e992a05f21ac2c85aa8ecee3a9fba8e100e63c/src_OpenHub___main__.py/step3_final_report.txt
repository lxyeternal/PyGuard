  "purpose": "Analyze the provided Python code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks, focusing on code patterns, data flows, and anomalies.",
  "sources": "Input functions, environment variables, untrusted data handling, dynamic code execution points such as 'exec' or 'eval'.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file output, system commands, or data exfiltration channels.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources like untrusted input or environment variables to sinks such as network sockets or file systems, potentially via dynamic execution or obfuscated code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'exec'/'eval', obfuscated variable names, hardcoded secrets, dynamic code generation, suspicious network activity, or unusual data handling patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits typical patterns of obfuscation and dynamic execution, with some handling of untrusted data. These are indicators of potential malicious intent, especially if combined with network activity or hardcoded secrets. The absence of such patterns suggests benign behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are generally consistent with these observations. Slightly increasing the malware score in Report 2 from 0.2 to 0.3 better reflects the potential risk posed by obfuscation and untrusted data handling. High suspicion in Report 3 justifies its high scores. Overall, the assessments are aligned with the evidence, and the scores are appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "Most reports accurately reflect the security posture of the code snippets. The only adjustment recommended is to slightly elevate the malware score in Report 2 to 0.3 to better match the obfuscation level and potential risks. The other scores are justified and consistent with their analyses.",
