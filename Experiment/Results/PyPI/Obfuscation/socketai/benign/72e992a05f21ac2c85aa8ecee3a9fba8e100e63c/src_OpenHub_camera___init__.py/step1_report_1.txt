  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not provided, but it appears to be a Python module or script intended for general use, possibly with external dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the standard input, environment variables, and possibly external modules or network if used elsewhere in the omitted parts.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include output functions like print, logging, or network calls if present; however, no explicit sinks are visible in the provided code fragment.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources such as user input or environment variables to various functions and potentially to output or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "There are no visible hardcoded credentials, suspicious dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code features in this snippet. The code structure appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code provided is minimal and lacks specific functions or logic, making a detailed source-to-sink flow analysis impossible. There are no apparent malicious patterns or anomalies. Usage of third-party libraries is not indicated as suspicious. Without additional context, no malicious behavior can be inferred.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there is no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or significant security risks. The snippet appears benign; however, limited context prevents a comprehensive assessment.",
