  "conclusion": "The majority of the code appears benign with low malware and risk scores. Report 5 indicates potential suspicious features that warrant cautious consideration, but without explicit code evidence, the suspicion remains moderate. Overall, the dependency is low risk, with some moderate suspicion in specific features. Further detailed code review is recommended for confirmation."
