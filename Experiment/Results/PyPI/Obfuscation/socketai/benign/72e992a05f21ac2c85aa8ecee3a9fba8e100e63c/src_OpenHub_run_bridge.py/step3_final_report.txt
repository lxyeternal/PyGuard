{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be incomplete or benign, with no explicit malicious patterns or obfuscation identified.",
  "sources": "No specific data sources or input points identified; code lacks context.",
  "sinks": "No suspicious sinks or data leaks observed; no external communications or sensitive data handling evident.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows indicating malicious activity; code flow appears straightforward.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual constructs detected; code structure is standard.",
  "analysis": "Multiple reports consistently indicate lack of malicious behavior, with low confidence due to incomplete context. No evidence of obfuscation or malicious intent was found, and scores reflect this assessment. The code's complexity is minimal, and no suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided reports and analysis, the dependency is benign with no detectable malicious activity or obfuscation. The low risk score of 0.2 is appropriate given the limited context, and malware and obfuscation scores remain at 0. Final assessment supports continued monitoring but no immediate concerns.",
