  "purpose": "The purpose of this code is not explicitly clear from the provided snippet, but it appears to involve importing modules, potentially for data processing or system interaction.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from imported modules and potentially from environment variables or input functions if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file system writes, or environment variable modifications if present.",
  "flows": "Data flow from imported modules or inputs to processing functions or output points.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious function names, or obfuscated code were detected. The code structure appears straightforward with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard import statements and possibly some function definitions or logic. No malicious or unusual patterns like dynamic code execution, obfuscated segments, or network communications are observed. The lack of specific actions makes precise evaluation challenging, but nothing suspicious appears within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems benign, with no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
