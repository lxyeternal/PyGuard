{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for network analysis by performing ping operations and mapping IP addresses.",
  "sources": "Potentially user input or external data sources used for network scanning or IP discovery.",
  "targets": "Untrusted data input points, possibly from parameters such as job_q or results_q, which could influence network scanning operations.",
  "flows": "Data from input sources (such as job_q, results_q) flows into functions that perform ping operations and IP mapping.",
  "anomalies": "Lack of actual implementation code; only docstrings are provided. No hardcoded credentials, malicious functions, or suspicious code behaviors are visible.",
  "analysis": "The provided code snippet is mostly descriptive with function comments and parameter descriptions. There is no executable logic or code that performs network operations, data handling, or data exfiltration. The docstrings indicate typical network ping and IP mapping functionalities, but without actual implementation, it's impossible to detect malicious behavior. The absence of suspicious operations, obfuscated code, or malicious instructions suggests normal functionality. However, incomplete code limits thorough analysis.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior or malware. The code appears to be intended for network mapping and pinging, with no evident security risks. Due to lack of actual code, confidence in this assessment is moderate.",
  "confidence": 0.6,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.2,
