{
  "purpose": "The code is intended for network scanning, pinging IP addresses, and mapping the network topology.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as job_q, results_q, pool_size, and descriptive comments indicating functions like 'Find my IP address' and 'Maps the network'.",
  "sinks": "Network operations such as pinging IPs and mapping, which could potentially be exploited if misused, but no actual network code is present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into network utility functions, but only in comments; no executable flow is observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; only comments and parameter descriptions are present, with no implementation code, secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The provided code snippet contains only high-level comments and parameter descriptions without actual implementation. All reviews correctly identify the absence of executable code, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. The scores assigned—malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2—are appropriate given the benign description and minimal inherent risk. Confidence levels are low to moderate, reflecting limited information. No suspicious or malicious activity is evident, and the code appears to serve standard network mapping purposes.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available information, the code shows no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk score is justified, and the absence of implementation details prevents any suspicion of malicious behavior. The assessments across all reports are consistent and appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted.",
