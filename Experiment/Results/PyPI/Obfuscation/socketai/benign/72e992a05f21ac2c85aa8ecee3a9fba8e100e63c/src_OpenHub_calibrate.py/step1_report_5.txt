{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple script that performs data processing and outputs results, likely for a utility or data analysis task.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from a function parameter, standard input, or external file; possibly from environment variables if used.",
  "sinks": "Outputs results to the console, logs, or writes to a file; possibly sends data over the network if such code exists.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions, then to output sinks; any untrusted input could influence output or network transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network connections, or obfuscated code detected. No use of dynamic code execution or misleading variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code reads input data in a standard manner, processes it with straightforward functions, and outputs results without apparent malicious logic. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system modification, or covert network activity are present. The code structure and format are conventional, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears to be a benign utility script with normal data processing functions.",
