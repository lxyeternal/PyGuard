  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided summaries.",
  "sources": "Dynamic imports, eval-like operations, environment variables, file reads, network sources",
  "sinks": "Potential code execution points, environment variable access, network communication",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or dynamic imports could lead to code execution or data leaks at sink points like eval or network calls",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic imports and eval-like functions without context of untrusted input; no actual malicious code observed",
  "analysis": "The reports correctly identify the absence of malicious activity in most cases. Report 2 notes dynamic imports and eval, which are inherently risky but not malicious without evidence of misuse. The scores are generally appropriate; malware remains at 0 where no malicious code is confirmed. The risk scores reflect potential concerns due to dynamic features. Confidence levels are justified based on the available information. The only adjustment needed is to slightly increase the malware score for Report 2 from 0 to 0.1 to acknowledge the inherent risks of dynamic code execution features, while maintaining the overall low threat assessment.",
  "conclusion": "Most reports correctly identify benign code with appropriate scoring. The primary concern is the use of dynamic imports and eval in Report 2, which warrants a slight increase in malware score to reflect potential misuse. All other assessments are consistent and justified.",
