{
  "purpose": "To assess the security posture of the open source dependency by analyzing code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Code snippets, data input points, environment variables, network communication functions, configuration files, external data sources",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, file system writes, environment variable access, eval/exec calls, data leaks, hardcoded credentials",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or user input flow into functions like eval, network communication, or data storage points, potentially leading to malicious actions",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation features, straightforward code structure, no external data leaks or malicious network activity",
  "analysis": "All reports consistently indicate benign code with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or high security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.2) align with the reasoning provided. Confidence levels are appropriate given the limited code context. No suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or malicious patterns are detected across the reports. The low risk score reflects minimal residual uncertainty, which is justified by the benign descriptions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears safe with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
