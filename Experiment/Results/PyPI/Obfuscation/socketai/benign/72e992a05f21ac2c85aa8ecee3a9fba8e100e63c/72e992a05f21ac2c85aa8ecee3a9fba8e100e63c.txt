      "conclusion": "The existing assessments are generally consistent with the absence of code and suspicious activity. To improve accuracy, confidence scores for reports without code should be reduced from 0.9 to around 0.3-0.4. Malware and obfuscation scores remain correctly at zero. The overall security risk remains low. Adjusting confidence levels enhances the alignment between descriptions and scoring, ensuring a more accurate security posture evaluation."

Report 4 shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, justifying moderate suspicion. The scores are appropriate and aligned with the evidence; further code inspection is recommended for suspicious reports to confirm malicious intent."

No further action or concern is warranted."

The low risk score of 0.2 is appropriate given the limited context, and malware and obfuscation scores remain at 0. Final assessment supports continued monitoring but no immediate concerns."

The other scores are justified and consistent with their analyses."
