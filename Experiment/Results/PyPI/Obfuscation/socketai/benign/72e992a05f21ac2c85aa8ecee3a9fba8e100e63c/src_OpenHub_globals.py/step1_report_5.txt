{
  "purpose": "This code appears to perform data processing and network communication, possibly for retrieving or sending information over the internet.",
  "sources": "Input data may be read from function parameters, environment variables, or network responses.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent over network sockets, written to files, or possibly passed to system commands. External communication points include network requests or socket connections.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (input or environment variables) to sinks (network or file operations). Potential source-to-sink paths include reading environment variables and then transmitting data over the network.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious payloads detected. The code uses standard libraries with no obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic execution. The code structure is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily focused on data handling and network communication. It does not contain suspicious patterns such as hardcoded secrets, untrusted input handling vulnerabilities, or malicious system modifications. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, cryptomining, or backdoors are apparent. The lack of obfuscation or unusual language features suggests normal code operation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no clear malicious intent or security risks. It performs expected data processing and network activities without suspicious behavior.",
