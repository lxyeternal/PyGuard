{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python module designed for data processing or utility functions. There is no explicit indication of malicious intent or harmful operations.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function parameters, environment variables, or standard input methods. No external data sources are explicitly accessed in this code segment.",
  "sinks": "Data outputs include return statements and possibly writing to files or network sockets if present. No suspicious data sinks like network connections or file modifications are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions to outputs; no untrusted data is directed to insecure sinks. No dangerous data flow paths are identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs are detected. The code structure appears straightforward with no obfuscated or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "A detailed review shows standard coding practices without malicious behavior. The code does not include network activity, file system manipulation, or data exfiltration. Usage of third-party libraries is not suspicious, and no insecure coding practices are apparent. Absence of dynamic code execution or hidden logic reduces suspicion. The overall structure and content do not indicate malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no signs of malicious intent or security threats. It functions as a typical utility or processing script without suspicious behaviors. Confidence in this assessment is high, and the code shows no obfuscation or malware indicators.",
