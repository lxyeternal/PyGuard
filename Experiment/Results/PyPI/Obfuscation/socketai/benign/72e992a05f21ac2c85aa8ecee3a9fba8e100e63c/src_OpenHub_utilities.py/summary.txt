  "conclusion": "The existing assessments are generally consistent with the absence of code and suspicious activity. To improve accuracy, confidence scores for reports without code should be reduced from 0.9 to around 0.3-0.4. Malware and obfuscation scores remain correctly at zero. The overall security risk remains low. Adjusting confidence levels enhances the alignment between descriptions and scoring, ensuring a more accurate security posture evaluation."
