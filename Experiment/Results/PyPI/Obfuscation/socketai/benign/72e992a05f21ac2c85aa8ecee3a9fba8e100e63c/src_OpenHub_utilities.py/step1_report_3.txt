  "purpose": "The purpose of this code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to perform some data processing or utility functions based on variable and function names.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters, possibly environment variables or configuration files if present, but no explicit input sources are shown.",
  "sinks": "The code writes output to variables, return statements, or logs. No direct network, file system, or system command executions are apparent.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input variables through processing functions to output or return statements; no suspicious data flow paths identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscated code, or unusual code constructs detected. No backdoors or hidden behaviors evident.",
  "analysis": "The code lacks any network activity, file manipulation, or environment variable usage that could indicate malicious intent. It uses standard functions and straightforward logic. Absence of external data sources or sinks reduces the risk profile. No signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads are present. Overall, the code appears benign based on the provided content.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code does not exhibit signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It seems to serve a benign purpose, with no evidence of malicious or suspicious activity.",
