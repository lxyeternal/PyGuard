{
  "purpose": "This code imports the TestCase class from Django's testing framework, serving as a setup for unit tests in a Django project.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources; static import statement.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points; code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only imports a class without executing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs present; straightforward import.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static import statement with no dynamic behavior, data handling, or external interactions. It does not read input, write output, or execute any logic beyond importing a class. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. The code is standard boilerplate for Django testing setup, and all signals indicate benign behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
