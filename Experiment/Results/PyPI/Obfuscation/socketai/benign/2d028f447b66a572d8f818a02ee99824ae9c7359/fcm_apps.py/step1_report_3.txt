  "purpose": "Define a Django application configuration class with an attribute set to 'fcm'.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own class definition and class attribute.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data leads to security issues.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the class attribute is hardcoded.",
  "anomalies": "Class name and attribute names are obfuscated with random strings; no functional code or dynamic behavior present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django AppConfig subclass with an obfuscated class name and a single class attribute set to a static string 'fcm'. There are no input sources, no dynamic code execution, no external data handling, and no suspicious network activity. The obfuscation appears to be purely cosmetic, with no malicious intent detectable. The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain backdoors or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code is an obfuscated, minimal Django app configuration class with no malicious behavior. It appears to serve a simple purpose without any security risks.",
