{
  "purpose": "Defines a minimal, obfuscated Django AppConfig subclass with a static attribute set to 'fcm', likely for configuration purposes.",
  "sources": "Static attribute assignment within the class; no input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flow to external systems or network communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the code only assigns a static string to a class attribute.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and attribute names; no dynamic code, input handling, or external communication; static assignment of 'fcm'.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple Django AppConfig subclass with obfuscated identifiers and a static attribute 'fcm'. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or dynamic code execution. The obfuscation appears cosmetic or generated, not necessarily malicious. Malware score is zero, risk is very low, and obfuscation is moderate, justified by the non-descriptive naming. The code's benign nature is consistent across multiple assessments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated Django configuration class with no malicious intent or activity. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No modifications are necessary.",
