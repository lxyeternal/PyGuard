  "purpose": "Define a Django application configuration class with a custom name and a single attribute.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources used in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is a simple class definition.",
  "anomalies": "The class name and attribute names are obfuscated or randomly generated, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No credentials, network calls, or data handling present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a Django AppConfig subclass with non-descriptive, seemingly random class name and attribute. It does not contain any I/O, network activity, or data processing. The only attribute 'ZNTgHKLTOzsbdRjDgBVzDeyeYjgTQUDL' is assigned a static string 'fcm', which could relate to Firebase Cloud Messaging, but alone does not indicate malicious intent. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation is minimal, and no suspicious activity is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Django app configuration with obfuscated naming. There is no malicious or suspicious behavior present in this snippet.",
