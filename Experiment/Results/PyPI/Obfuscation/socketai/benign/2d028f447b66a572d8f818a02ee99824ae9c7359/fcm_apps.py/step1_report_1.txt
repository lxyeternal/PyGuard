  "purpose": "Define a Django application configuration class with a specific app label.",
  "sources": "Import statement for AppConfig; class declaration; class attribute assignment",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data output or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "Class instantiation and attribute assignment, but no data flows involving untrusted input",
  "anomalies": "Class name and attribute name appear obfuscated; no meaningful identifiers; no apparent functional logic",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django AppConfig subclass with a seemingly random class name and attribute. The attribute 'ZNTgHKLTOzsbdRjDgBVzDeyeYjgTQUDL' is assigned the string 'fcm'. There is no input handling, no data processing, and no external communication. The obfuscated naming could suggest an attempt to hide functionality, but on its own, this code does not demonstrate malicious behavior. It is a minimal, benign configuration snippet with no suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple, obfuscated Django AppConfig class with no malicious or security-sensitive operations. The obfuscated identifiers do not indicate malicious intent by themselves, and no malicious activity is evident.",
