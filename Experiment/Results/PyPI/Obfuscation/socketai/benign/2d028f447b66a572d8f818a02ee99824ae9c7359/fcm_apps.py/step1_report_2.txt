  "purpose": "Define a Django application configuration class with a specific app label.",
  "sources": "The import statement for AppConfig and the class definition with class attributes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "No data flow from input sources to sensitive sinks; the code only defines a class.",
  "anomalies": "Class name and attribute are obfuscated or randomly generated, but this alone is not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django's AppConfig and defines a class with an obfuscated name, assigning a string 'fcm' to an attribute with an obfuscated name. No user input, network activity, or sensitive data handling is present. The obfuscation could be benign or an attempt to hide intent, but based solely on this snippet, there's no malicious behavior. The code appears to be a typical Django app configuration with non-descriptive naming.",
  "conclusion": "This code defines a standard Django application configuration class with obfuscated naming. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this snippet. The obfuscation may be for code hiding or simply an artifact of code generation, but it does not indicate malicious intent.",
