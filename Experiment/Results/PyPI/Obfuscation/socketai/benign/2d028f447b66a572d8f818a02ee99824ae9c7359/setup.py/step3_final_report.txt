  "purpose": "This is a setup.py script for a Python package, reading a README file and configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading README.rst file, static variables, and parameters within setup()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input or external data sources; no network or code execution points",
  "flows": "Static data assigned to variables and passed directly to setup() without dynamic or external influence",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variable names and a suspicious string 'eyk1ezdluuhrn3bp' assigned to a parameter with an obfuscated key 'ZNTgHKLTOzsbdRjDgBVzDeyeYjgTQUDL'",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard package setup script with obfuscated variable names and a hardcoded string that resembles a secret or token. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted input is present. The suspicious string and obfuscated parameter names suggest potential secret embedding or obfuscation but do not demonstrate malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or system compromise. The obfuscation appears superficial, and the code's intent seems benign, primarily involving package configuration. The presence of a string that looks like a secret warrants caution but does not confirm malicious intent. Overall, the code does not exhibit active malicious behavior or security risks beyond obfuscation and potential secret embedding.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with superficial obfuscation and a suspicious string that could be a secret. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security compromise. The obfuscation and embedded string warrant further review but are not definitive indicators of malicious intent. The overall security risk is low, and the malware likelihood is minimal.",
