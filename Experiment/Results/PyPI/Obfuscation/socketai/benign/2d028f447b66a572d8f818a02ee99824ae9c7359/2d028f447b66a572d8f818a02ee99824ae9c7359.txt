      "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with superficial obfuscation and a suspicious string that could be a secret. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security compromise. The obfuscation and embedded string warrant further review but are not definitive indicators of malicious intent. The overall security risk is low, and the malware likelihood is minimal."

      "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated and interacts with an external utility, which could be malicious or benign. No explicit malicious actions are evident from the static code, but the obfuscation and external calls justify caution. The malware score is set at 0.2, reflecting suspicion but no confirmed malicious activity. The security risk score is moderate (~0.4), and obfuscation is high (~0.75). Further analysis of the external utility's behavior is recommended before deployment."

Minor adjustment to reduce securityRisk to 0.1 could be considered for increased confidence, but current values are acceptable."

      "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated, raising red flags, but lacks concrete evidence of malicious behavior. The suspicion is primarily due to concealment, not active malicious actions. Further review of the utility class and overall application context is recommended. The current scores are appropriate; I suggest maintaining a moderate risk level and investigating the utility class for hidden malicious code."

There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, remote code execution, or backdoors. The low malware score (0) aligns with the analysis, while the high obfuscation score (~0.75) indicates concern over code clarity. Overall, the security risk is moderate (~0.3), mainly due to obfuscation hindering auditability. The code appears benign but warrants further review if used in security-critical contexts."

No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data handling are present. The primary concern is the obfuscation, which could hinder analysis or hide malicious code if present. Scores: malware 0, obfuscated 0.6, security risk 0.2."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The analyzed code functions as a device management and messaging interface within Django admin, with obfuscation likely for concealment. There is no evidence of malicious activity or malware. The primary risk stems from the external 'send_message' method, which should be reviewed separately. The malware score is set low (around 0.1), reflecting the absence of malicious indicators. Obfuscation remains high, and the overall security risk is moderate (~0.3). Continued review of the 'send_message' implementation is recommended to ensure security."

      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard Django form logic with heavily obfuscated class and variable names. No concrete evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities is present. The primary concern is obfuscation, which could conceal malicious behavior, but static analysis alone does not confirm this. Further dynamic analysis or review of the utility class is recommended to rule out hidden malicious intent."
