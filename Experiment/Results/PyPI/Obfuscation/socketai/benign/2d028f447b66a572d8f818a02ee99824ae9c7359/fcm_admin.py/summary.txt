  "conclusion": "The analyzed code functions as a device management and messaging interface within Django admin, with obfuscation likely for concealment. There is no evidence of malicious activity or malware. The primary risk stems from the external 'send_message' method, which should be reviewed separately. The malware score is set low (around 0.1), reflecting the absence of malicious indicators. Obfuscation remains high, and the overall security risk is moderate (~0.3). Continued review of the 'send_message' implementation is recommended to ensure security."
