  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated and interacts with an external utility, which could be malicious or benign. No explicit malicious actions are evident from the static code, but the obfuscation and external calls justify caution. The malware score is set at 0.2, reflecting suspicion but no confirmed malicious activity. The security risk score is moderate (~0.4), and obfuscation is high (~0.75). Further analysis of the external utility's behavior is recommended before deployment."
