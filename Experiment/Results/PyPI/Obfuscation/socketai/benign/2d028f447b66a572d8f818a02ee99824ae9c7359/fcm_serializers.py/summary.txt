  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated, raising red flags, but lacks concrete evidence of malicious behavior. The suspicion is primarily due to concealment, not active malicious actions. Further review of the utility class and overall application context is recommended. The current scores are appropriate; I suggest maintaining a moderate risk level and investigating the utility class for hidden malicious code."
