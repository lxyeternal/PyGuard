{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be the definition of some functions and possibly a class to perform specific operations, likely related to data processing or utility functions. The exact intent is unclear without more context, but it seems to be a general-purpose module.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data through function parameters, environment variables (if any), or external library calls. Specific data sources are not explicitly visible in the provided fragment.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include data output functions, network calls, or file operations if present later in the code. No explicit sink points are visible in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no clear source-to-sink data flows in the visible code. The functions and their calls suggest local data processing without external data or network communication.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are evident. The code appears to follow standard Python syntax and structure.",
  "analysis": "The code fragment defines functions with standard naming and structure. There are no signs of malicious intent like code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected based on the available code. The code does not include external network calls, sensitive data handling, or environment manipulation. It appears to be a benign, well-structured Python module, possibly part of a larger project.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code appears safe and typical of a utility or functional module. Further review of additional code sections would be needed for a comprehensive assessment.",
