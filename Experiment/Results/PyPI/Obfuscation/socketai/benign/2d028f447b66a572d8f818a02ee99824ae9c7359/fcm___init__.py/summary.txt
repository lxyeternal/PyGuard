  "conclusion": "Based on the provided summaries, the dependency appears benign with no malicious behavior or obfuscation detected. The current scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the assessments. Minor adjustment to reduce securityRisk to 0.1 could be considered for increased confidence, but current values are acceptable."
