  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for general functionality, possibly involving data processing or network communication, but no specific purpose is explicitly clear from the provided snippet.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are not explicitly visible; potential sources could include user input, environment variables, or external files, but none are clearly identified in the snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could involve network connections, file writes, or system commands, but no direct suspicious or insecure operations are observable from the code provided.",
  "flows": "Without concrete source and sink points, no explicit source-to-sink data flow can be determined from the code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code are evident in the provided code. The code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code does not contain any clear malicious patterns such as network exfiltration, code injection, or access to sensitive data. It uses common Python constructs and libraries without suspicious modifications. No signs of obfuscation or malware-like behavior are present. The absence of external input handling or dangerous operations suggests a benign nature, although the lack of context limits full assessment.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears normal and free from suspicious or malicious behavior, with no hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads observed.",
