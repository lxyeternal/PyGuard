  "conclusion": "The code is primarily a device management API with significant obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, remote code execution, or backdoors. The low malware score (0) aligns with the analysis, while the high obfuscation score (~0.75) indicates concern over code clarity. Overall, the security risk is moderate (~0.3), mainly due to obfuscation hindering auditability. The code appears benign but warrants further review if used in security-critical contexts."
