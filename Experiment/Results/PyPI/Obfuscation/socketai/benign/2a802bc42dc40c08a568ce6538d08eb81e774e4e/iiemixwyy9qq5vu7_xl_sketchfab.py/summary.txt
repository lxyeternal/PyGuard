  "conclusion": "The code is primarily a dataset management utility with significant obfuscation. There is no concrete evidence of active malware or malicious behavior. However, the obfuscation and dynamic URL handling could be exploited to hide malicious payloads. Overall, the risk is moderate, and further review or sandbox testing is recommended before deployment in sensitive environments."
