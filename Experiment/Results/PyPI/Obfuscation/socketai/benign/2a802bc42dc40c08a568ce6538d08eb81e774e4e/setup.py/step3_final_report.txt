{
  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script that reads README.md and requirements.txt, then invokes setuptools.setup() with package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' and 'requirements.txt' files via open() calls with obfuscated parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection detected.",
  "flows": "File reads from README.md and requirements.txt into variables, then passed into setup() parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Use of nonsensical, obfuscated string parameters in open() calls (e.g., 'bdAoRkjRkUzihNXUhPLqZSDSAYDgtnYq=') instead of standard 'encoding'; obfuscated variable names; suspicious string literals assigned to setup parameters.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with heavy obfuscation, likely to conceal its intent. No malicious behavior such as network activity or code injection is evident. The unusual parameters in open() are invalid in standard Python and suggest obfuscation or placeholder strings. Variable names are nonsensical, reducing readability but not indicating malicious intent. The scores assigned in reports (malware 0.0-0.2, obfuscated 0.4-0.8, risk 0.1-0.4) are consistent with the observed obfuscation but lack evidence of active malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with significant obfuscation. No malware is detected. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not constitute a security threat. The scores provided are appropriate and align with the analysis.",
