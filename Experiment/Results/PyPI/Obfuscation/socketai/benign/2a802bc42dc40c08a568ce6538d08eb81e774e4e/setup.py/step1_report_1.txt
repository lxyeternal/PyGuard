{
  "purpose": "The code is setting up a Python package, reading README and requirements files, and configuring package metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md and requirements.txt files from the filesystem",
  "sinks": "Uses data from files to configure package setup; no direct sinks for untrusted data in the code",
  "flows": "File contents flow from file reads into variables, then into setup() configuration",
  "anomalies": "Presence of non-standard, seemingly random variable names, and suspicious parameters such as 'bdAoRkjRkUzihNXUhPLqZSDSAYDgtnYq=' used as encoding arguments, which appear obfuscated or placeholder-like. The 'version' field is straightforward. No hardcoded secrets or credentials detected. The unusual variable names and redundant code may suggest obfuscation, but do not necessarily indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script loads README and requirements files with atypical parameter names, possibly to evade detection or for obfuscation. The setup() call appears standard for package configuration, with no suspicious code injection or network activity. The strange variable names and encoding parameters are suspicious but may be intentionally obfuscated or placeholders. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network connections, or code injection. Overall, the code is a standard setup script with obfuscation-like naming but no malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a package setup script with obfuscated variable names, which could be an attempt at concealment. There is no clear evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The code appears to be a standard setup configuration with potential obfuscation but no malicious actions.",
