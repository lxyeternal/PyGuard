    "Reading 'README.md' file for long description",

  "anomalies": [
    "File open statements use unusual parameter 'bdAoRkjRkUzihNXUhPLqZSDSAYDgtnYq=' which appears to be a random string, possibly obfuscating encoding or tampering",
    "Variable names are nonsensical and random, which may indicate obfuscation or attempt to hide intent",
    "No malicious code present, but obfuscated and inconsistent naming raises suspicion about code hygiene",
    "No explicit network or system calls, no hardcoded credentials, no malicious imports"
  ],
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package, but with obfuscated and nonsensical parameter names. The file open calls include unusual parameters that resemble attempts at obfuscation or misdirection. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, such as network activity or data exfiltration. The use of random strings for parameters and variable names could be a sign of obfuscation, but not necessarily malicious. Overall, it appears to be a benign setup script with potential obfuscation for obscure reasons.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a package setup script, but uses obfuscated parameter names and unusual file open parameters. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or malicious data flow. The obfuscation may be benign or intended to hide details, but no malicious behavior is evident from this snippet.",
