  "conclusion": "The code is a complex, obfuscated data management utility that performs legitimate download and verification tasks. While obfuscation and reliance on external URLs pose some security considerations, there is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or remote code execution. The malware score should remain low (~0.2-0.3), and the overall security risk moderate (~0.3-0.4). Vigilance is advised when deploying, especially regarding callback functions and URL sources."
