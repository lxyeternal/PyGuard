{
  "purpose": "The code performs static import of modules/functions with obfuscated identifiers, likely to conceal intent.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.parser and .v3_1), with identifiers assigned to obfuscated variable names.",
  "sinks": "No active sinks; no data flows, network activity, or system modifications are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "N/A – only static import statements; no runtime data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation of variable and module names; no descriptive identifiers; lack of comments or documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with obfuscated aliases, which suggests an attempt to conceal the true purpose. No active malicious behavior, data leakage, or system modification is visible. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0.2, obfuscated 0.8, risk 0.3) are consistent with this analysis. Further review of the imported modules' content is necessary to determine if they contain malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign in isolation but uses obfuscation techniques that warrant further investigation of the imported modules. No active malicious behavior is detected in this snippet.",
