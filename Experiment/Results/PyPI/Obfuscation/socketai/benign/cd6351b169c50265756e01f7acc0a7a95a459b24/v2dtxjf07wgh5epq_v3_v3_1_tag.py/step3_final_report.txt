  "purpose": "Define a Pydantic data model with optional description and external documentation, with conditional configuration based on an obfuscated import variable.",
  "sources": "Import of obfuscated modules and constants; usage of the variable wVZizmiOvodhiYmTpwNRZBPbnUYgUzYa for conditional logic.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; the code does not process untrusted input or perform network/file operations.",
  "flows": "Conditional branch depending on wVZizmiOvodhiYmTpwNRZBPbnUYgUzYa determines whether to assign a configuration object or define a nested class with static attributes.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated import names, dynamic class attribute creation, conditional logic that can obscure intent, use of obfuscated variable and class names.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Pydantic model with optional description and external documentation. It imports obfuscated modules and constants, then uses a boolean variable to decide between assigning a configuration object or defining an inner class with static attributes. No network, file, or external data operations are present. The obfuscation and conditional logic could be used to hide malicious intent but are also consistent with auto-generated or intentionally obscured code. The malware score is low (0.1), as no malicious actions are evident; obfuscation is high (0.8), and overall security risk is low (0.2).",
  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated with conditional logic that could hide malicious intent, but no active malicious behavior is present. The high obfuscation warrants caution, but the absence of malicious actions suggests a low threat level. The malware score should be low, with a high obfuscation score and low security risk.",
