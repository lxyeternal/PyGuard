  "purpose": "Define a Pydantic data model with conditional logic for setting a class attribute based on an external variable.",
  "sources": "External variable 'wVZizmiOvodhiYmTpwNRZBPbnUYgUzYa' used in if condition, and imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Assignment to class attribute 'pfcIMgSeGsyunWlkEAXMqHLDdceCEQMW', which involves calling external class 'ZUGLnNAybMmybGSxSkErJrXGYoXCvLcC'.",
  "flows": "The flow depends on the external variable: if true, setting attribute with a class instance; if false, defining an inner class with a class attribute assigned from imported module.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated import names, external variable influencing class attribute assignment, and dynamic class and attribute creation suggest obfuscation or hidden logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports obfuscated modules and uses a runtime condition to assign a class attribute or define an inner class. The external variable controls which path executes. The imported modules and variables have non-descriptive names, indicating potential obfuscation. The code does not perform any explicit malicious actions, such as network access, data exfiltration, or system modification, within this fragment. The conditional logic appears to dynamically alter class attributes, which could be used to hide malicious behavior or code paths, but no direct malicious activity is evident here. Overall, the code appears to be obfuscated but does not show signs of malicious behavior based on this fragment alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated with dynamic class and attribute assignments controlled by an external variable. No explicit malicious behavior is detected, but obfuscation suggests potential for hidden or malicious intent. Caution is advised if part of a larger, untrusted package.",
