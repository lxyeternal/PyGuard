  "purpose": "Define a Pydantic model with conditional attribute assignment based on an imported variable, using obfuscated class and variable names.",
  "sources": "Import of external variable 'wVZizmiOvodhiYmTpwNRZBPbnUYgUzYa' and usage within conditional statements.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no network, file, or system operations; only internal attribute and class definitions.",
  "flows": "Conditional flow based on the imported variable leading to assignment of a class instance or inner class definition.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated variable, class, and import names; dynamic conditional logic; reliance on external variable without context; no clear malicious activity but potential concealment.",
  "analysis": "The code is heavily obfuscated with non-descriptive identifiers and conditional logic based on an imported variable. It defines a Pydantic model with optional fields and a required string. Depending on the external variable, it either assigns an object with a hardcoded 'allow' string or defines an inner class with an obfuscated attribute. No network, file, or malicious system activity is evident. The obfuscation and dynamic logic could conceal malicious intent, but no direct malicious actions are observed in this isolated snippet. The scores from the reports (malware 0.1-0.2, obfuscated 0.7-0.8, risk 0.2-0.3) are consistent with the analysis, indicating high obfuscation but no confirmed malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be an obfuscated configuration or conditional data model setup with no concrete evidence of malicious behavior. The high obfuscation warrants caution, but the absence of malicious activity suggests a low threat level. The scores should be adjusted slightly downward for malware (to 0.1) to reflect the lack of malicious actions, while obfuscation remains high. Overall, the code is benign but suspicious in style, requiring broader context review.",
