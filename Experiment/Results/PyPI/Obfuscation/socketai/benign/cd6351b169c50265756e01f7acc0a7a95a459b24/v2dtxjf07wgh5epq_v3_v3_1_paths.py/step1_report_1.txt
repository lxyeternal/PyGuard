  "purpose": "Type alias declaration for a dictionary with string keys and custom object values",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'Dict' from 'typing', and import of 'xvJYROHpkSYnfXtybseEaQbHIissgFBZ' from a local module",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no data processing or output operations",
  "flows": "No data flow present; only type alias declaration without runtime data processing",
  "anomalies": "Unusual import names and obfuscated-looking class name; no actual code logic or data handling",
  "analysis": "The code defines a type alias for a dictionary mapping strings to a class or object with an obfuscated name. The import path is local and does not indicate external network or system calls. There are no functions, data processing, or runtime behaviors that could indicate malicious activity. The obfuscated class name and unusual import style could be suspicious but might also be a coding style or code generation artifact. Overall, the code is minimal and does not perform any operations or data handling that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely declares a type alias for a dictionary with a custom object. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks in this fragment. The obfuscated naming is unusual but not inherently malicious. No malware or security risks are detected based on this snippet.",
