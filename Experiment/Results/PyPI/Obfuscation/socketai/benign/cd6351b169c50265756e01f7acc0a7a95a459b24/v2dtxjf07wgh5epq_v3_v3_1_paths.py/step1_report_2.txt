{
  "purpose": "Importing a type alias for a dictionary mapping strings to a specific class or object imported from a local module.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module import statements and the definitions of type aliases.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating untrusted data processing or output operations are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the code solely defines a type alias.",
  "anomalies": "The imported class name appears obfuscated or auto-generated, which could be suspicious, but this alone isn't evidence of malicious intent. The code is minimal and standard in structure.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a type from a local module and creates a type alias for a dictionary mapping strings to this type. There are no external inputs, outputs, or execution logic. The obfuscated class name may be a result of code obfuscation or auto-generation but does not directly indicate malicious behavior. No suspicious activities, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple type alias declaration with an obfuscated class name. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues based solely on this snippet.",
