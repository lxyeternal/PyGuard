  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is a simple type alias declaration, importing a class with an obfuscated name. No data flow, sinks, or runtime logic.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0. Scores seem appropriate.\n- **Comments:** The high obfuscation score (0.8) is justified given the obfuscated class name, but since there's no malicious activity, the overall risk remains low.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar minimal code, with an obfuscated class name. No data processing or external interactions.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.1. The low security risk score is reasonable.\n- **Comments:** Slightly higher confidence (0.9) and obfuscation (0.7) are justified, but no malicious activity is indicated.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Again, a straightforward type alias with an obfuscated class name. No runtime logic or data flow.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0. Scores are consistent.\n- **Comments:** No concerns beyond obfuscation.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Same pattern—obfuscated class name, no data flow or external communication.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.1. Appropriate.\n- **Comments:** The suspicion due to obfuscation is noted but not supported by any malicious activity.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same minimal code, obfuscated class name, no runtime logic.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code snippet. The code is purely a type alias declaration with no executable or network activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** Scores are high (0.7–0.8), justified by the obfuscated class name, which could be auto-generated or intentionally obscured.\n- **Risk Score:** All are very low (0 or 0.1), appropriate given the absence of actual logic or data flow.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The code snippet appears benign. The obfuscated class name warrants further review if part of a larger codebase, but on its own, it doesn't indicate malicious intent.\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent across reports.\n\n### My estimated scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.8 (consistent with the reports)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, due to obfuscation but no actual risk)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a benign type alias declaration with obfuscated naming, no data flow, and no malicious behavior. The current scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
