  "purpose": "Type alias declaration for a dictionary with string keys and values of an obfuscated class imported from a local module.",
  "sources": "Import of class 'xvJYROHpkSYnfXtybseEaQbHIissgFBZ' from '.path_item' module.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows, external calls, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; only a static type alias declaration.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class name, which may indicate code obfuscation or auto-generation but not malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static type alias declaration importing an obfuscated class. No runtime logic, data processing, or external interactions are present. The obfuscated naming could be for code generation or obfuscation purposes but does not inherently suggest malicious behavior. The lack of data flows, sinks, or external calls indicates no security risks or malicious activity. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, securityRisk=0 or 0.1, obfuscated=0.7-0.8, confidence=0.6-1) are consistent with this analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely as a type alias with obfuscated naming. No evidence of malicious intent or security risks is present. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's minimal and non-executing nature.",
