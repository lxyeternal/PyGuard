{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define configuration and schema-related utilities for the pydantic library, including version checks, type definitions, and conditional imports based on the pydantic version.",
  "sources": "Version string parsing from pydantic.version, conditional imports, and function/type definitions based on version checks.",
  "sinks": "No obvious sinks that handle untrusted data; no network, file, or environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Version parsing flows into conditional logic affecting imports and type definitions; no data flow involving untrusted sources detected.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names, complex conditional imports, and dynamic code generation patterns that complicate understanding. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. The obfuscation may be suspicious but appears to serve code organization or compatibility purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages import paths and type definitions depending on the pydantic version. It uses obfuscated variable names possibly to hide the intent or prevent straightforward reading. There are no signs of malicious data handling, network activity, or system manipulation. The obfuscation and version-based conditional code are typical in compatibility layers, not inherently malicious. No external data is read at runtime, and no dangerous functions are invoked.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a compatibility layer for pydantic schema handling with obfuscated variable names. There are no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. The complexity and obfuscation could be suspicious but are likely for compatibility purposes.",
