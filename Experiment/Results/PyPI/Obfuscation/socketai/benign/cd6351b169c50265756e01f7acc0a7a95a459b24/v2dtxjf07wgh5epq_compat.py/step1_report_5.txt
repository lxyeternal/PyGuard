{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define type annotations, version checks, and conditional imports/configurations related to the pydantic library for schema validation and model configuration.",
  "sources": "Version string parsing, conditional import statements, and function definitions that set schema-related constants and types.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks; no network, file, or environment variable operations are present.",
  "flows": "Conditional imports and definitions based on pydantic version; no untrusted data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names; multiple conditional branches that redefine schema-related variables and functions; no actual implementation logic or data handling evident.",
  "analysis": "The code checks pydantic version and accordingly sets up schema-related constants, types, and functions. The variable names are intentionally obfuscated, which might hinder readability but does not necessarily indicate malicious intent. The conditional branches do not contain executable logic or data processing but merely set up schema configuration placeholders, possibly for use elsewhere. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The obfuscation seems aimed at hiding implementation details or complicating analysis but does not on its own indicate malware.",
  "conclusion": "This code primarily manages schema-related configuration with obfuscated variable names and conditional imports. No malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks are evident. The obfuscation appears to be for hiding structure or intent, not for malicious purposes. Overall, the code is benign with respect to supply chain security and malware risk.",
