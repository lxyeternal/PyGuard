{
  "purpose": "Compatibility and configuration layer for pydantic schemas, handling version-dependent imports and schema definitions.",
  "sources": "Version checks on PYDANTIC_VERSION, conditional imports, and stub functions/constants related to schema generation.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; functions are placeholders or simple data structures, with no data flow from external inputs.",
  "flows": "Version info and conditional imports determine which code path executes; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with non-descriptive variable and function names; conditional code paths based on environment and version checks.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up compatibility and schema configuration utilities with obfuscated identifiers. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. Obfuscation appears intentional, possibly to evade static detection or for code organization. The functions are either stubs or simple returners, serving as configuration utilities. No secrets, credentials, or malicious behaviors are evident. The obfuscation is suspicious but not malicious, and the code's purpose seems benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is an obfuscated compatibility/configuration utility for pydantic schemas, with no malicious intent or security risks. The obfuscation likely aims to obscure internal logic or evade static analysis but does not constitute a supply chain threat.",
