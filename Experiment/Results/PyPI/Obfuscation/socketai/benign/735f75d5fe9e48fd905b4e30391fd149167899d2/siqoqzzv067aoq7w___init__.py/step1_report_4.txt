{
  "purpose": "Assignment of a version string to a variable, likely indicating a version number for a package or module.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only assigns a string literal to a variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present, as there is no processing or output of untrusted data.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code is a simple variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "The variable name appears obfuscated or nonsensical, which could be suspicious; however, it may also be an arbitrary variable name.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single line assigning a string '0.0.57' to a variable named 'zkGjXPHHWYUOVJHaEcZckJSuCTiuBnpM'. This appears to be a version string, possibly for a package or component. No external data is read, no data is sent or processed, and no suspicious behavior is evident. The obfuscated variable name might be an attempt at concealment but does not by itself indicate malicious intent. There are no functions, no network calls, and no other code to analyze further.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple assignment of a version string to a variable with an obfuscated name. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based on this snippet alone.",

  "obfuscated": 0.2,
