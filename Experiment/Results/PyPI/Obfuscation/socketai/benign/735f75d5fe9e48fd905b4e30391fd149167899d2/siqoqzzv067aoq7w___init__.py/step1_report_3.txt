{
  "purpose": "The code assigns a version string '0.0.57' to a variable named 'zkGjXPHHWYUOVJHaEcZckJSuCTiuBnpM', likely as part of a package or module version indicator.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only defines a variable with a static string value.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data flows or could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists, as the code only performs a variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "The variable name appears obfuscated or randomly generated, which may be unusual but is not inherently malicious. No other anomalies are present.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static version string to an obfuscated variable name. There are no external inputs, no dynamic code execution, no network connections, or suspicious operations. The only unusual aspect is the variable name, which seems intentionally obfuscated, possibly to hide purpose. However, this alone does not indicate malicious intent. No security issues or malware behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and merely assigns a version string to an obfuscated variable name. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks.",

  "obfuscated": 0.3,
