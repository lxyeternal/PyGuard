{
  "purpose": "Assign a version string to a variable with an obfuscated name, likely for internal or obfuscation purposes.",
  "sources": "No external input, data flow, or data reading; static assignment.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or output.",
  "flows": "N/A; simple static assignment with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable name; no other anomalies present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward assignment of a version string to an obfuscated variable name. No external inputs, network activity, or malicious code are present. The variable name appears obfuscated but does not indicate malicious intent. The absence of data flows or suspicious operations confirms benign behavior. The variable assignment is static and harmless.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscated variable name is likely for internal or obfuscation purposes but does not pose a security threat.",
