  "purpose": "Defines a Django AppConfig subclass with obfuscated class and attribute names, containing a static string value.",
  "sources": "No input, output, or external data sources; static class and attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows leading to data leaks or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static assignment with no dynamic or external influence.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated class and attribute names; static string 'cast_bootstrap5' which may be used for styling or configuration but is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal Django AppConfig subclass with obfuscated identifiers and a static string attribute. No input/output, external communication, or dynamic code execution is present. The obfuscation suggests concealment but does not inherently indicate malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious behavior, assigning malware scores of 0. The obfuscation scores are high (around 0.7-0.9), reflecting the obscured identifiers, which is reasonable. Security risk scores are very low (0-0.2), consistent with the lack of external or malicious activity. Overall, the code appears benign, with obfuscation being the primary concern but not evidence of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is obfuscated but harmless, with no signs of malware or malicious behavior. The high obfuscation scores are justified, and the low security risk scores are appropriate given the absence of external or malicious actions.",
