  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate-looking Twitter API wrapper with heavy obfuscation. While obfuscation raises suspicion, there is no concrete evidence of malicious activity or payloads. The current scores (malware ~0.2, obfuscation ~0.8, risk ~0.4) are consistent with the analysis. Further review of helper modules and overall package context is recommended before deployment or inclusion in sensitive systems."
