      "conclusion": "The provided code snippet contains only obfuscated import statements with no active malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The high obfuscation scores are justified but do not indicate malicious intent. The malware score remains at 0, and the overall security risk is low. Further analysis would require inspecting the imported modules' actual code or runtime behavior to confirm security posture."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate Twitter automation utility with significant obfuscation and incomplete variables, which could conceal malicious activity. However, based on the provided snippet and reports, there is no direct evidence of malware or malicious payloads. The low malware scores are justified, but the high obfuscation and incomplete code suggest a need for cautious monitoring. Overall, the risk is moderate, and further validation and input validation are recommended to prevent misuse."

The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. Further review of the imported modules and overall package context is recommended before concluding any security threat."

The current scores (malware ~0.2, obfuscation ~0.8, risk ~0.4) are consistent with the analysis. Further review of helper modules and overall package context is recommended before deployment or inclusion in sensitive systems."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign credential loader with superficial obfuscation. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain attacks are evident. The obfuscation scores are justified given the variable naming. The overall security risk is low. The primary concern is secure handling of credentials outside this code fragment, but from this analysis, the code itself is safe."
