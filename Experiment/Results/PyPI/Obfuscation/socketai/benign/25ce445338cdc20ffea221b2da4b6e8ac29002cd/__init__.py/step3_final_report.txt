  "purpose": "Import statements from the utils_twitter package, likely for Twitter data processing or automation.",
  "sources": "Import statements from utils_twitter modules, which are obfuscated or auto-generated class/function names.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed; only static import statements.",
  "flows": "No active data flow or execution; import statements do not create runtime data paths.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and function names, which could indicate concealment but are not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with obfuscated identifiers, indicating no active logic, data flow, or network activity. The high obfuscation scores are justified given the nonsensical class names, but no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks is present. The malware score should remain at 0, as there are no signs of malicious intent. The obfuscation score is high (~0.7), reflecting the obfuscated identifiers, which is reasonable. The risk score is low (~0.2), consistent with the lack of active code or suspicious patterns. Overall, the code appears benign, and the import statements alone do not pose security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code snippet contains only obfuscated import statements with no active malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The high obfuscation scores are justified but do not indicate malicious intent. The malware score remains at 0, and the overall security risk is low. Further analysis would require inspecting the imported modules' actual code or runtime behavior to confirm security posture.",
