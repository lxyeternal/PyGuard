{
  "purpose": "The code imports various classes and functions from the 'utils_twitter' package, likely intended for Twitter data processing or automation tasks.",
  "sources": "Imports occur at the beginning, accessing modules within the 'utils_twitter' package, which may load code or data from the package files.",
  "sinks": "No sinks (such as network connections, file writes, or system commands) are explicitly present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flow is limited to the import statements; there are no runtime data flows from sources to sinks within this fragment.",
  "anomalies": "All imported names appear to be obfuscated or auto-generated, which can be suspicious, but are not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behavior are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of import statements with obfuscated class and function names from a package named 'utils_twitter.' There is no executable logic, network activity, or data handling shown. Obfuscated identifiers might be intended to hinder reverse engineering but are not sufficient evidence of malicious intent. Without further context or code execution, there is no indication of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment appears to be standard import statements from an obfuscated or auto-generated package. No malicious activity, supply chain attacks, or security risks are apparent based solely on these imports. Further code would be needed to assess any active behavior.",

  "obfuscated": 0.8,
