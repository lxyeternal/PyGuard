  "conclusion": "The provided code snippet contains only obfuscated import statements with no active malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The high obfuscation scores are justified but do not indicate malicious intent. The malware score remains at 0, and the overall security risk is low. Further analysis would require inspecting the imported modules' actual code or runtime behavior to confirm security posture."
