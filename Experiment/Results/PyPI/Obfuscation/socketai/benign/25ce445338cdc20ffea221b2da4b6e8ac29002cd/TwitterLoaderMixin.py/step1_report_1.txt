  "purpose": "The code provides a class to retrieve Twitter API credentials either from environment variables or command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "Environment variables: 'TWTR_API_KEY', 'TWTR_API_SECRET_KEY', 'TWTR_ACCESS_TOKEN', 'TWTR_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET'; Command-line arguments: '--twtr_api_key', '--twtr_api_secret_key', '--twtr_access_token', '--twtr_access_token_secret'.",
  "sinks": "Use of environment variables and command-line arguments to load sensitive API credentials; these are stored in class attributes.",
  "flows": "Credentials are retrieved from environment variables or command-line arguments and assigned to class instances, without any further processing or transmission.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables and command-line arguments for sensitive credentials is common; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code behaviors observed. Argument parser setup appears standard with no obfuscated or unusual logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with methods to fetch Twitter API credentials either from environment variables or via command-line arguments. The environment variable access and argument parsing are straightforward and typical for configuration handling. No malicious code, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors, is present. The code solely manages credentials input, with no further actions or data flows indicating malicious intent. The presence of sensitive data handling in itself is not malicious, but it emphasizes the importance of secure storage and handling. Overall, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or sabotage. The code appears to be part of a legitimate configuration setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code securely retrieves API credentials via environment variables or command-line arguments. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks beyond normal credential handling. No suspicious or malicious signals are detected.",
