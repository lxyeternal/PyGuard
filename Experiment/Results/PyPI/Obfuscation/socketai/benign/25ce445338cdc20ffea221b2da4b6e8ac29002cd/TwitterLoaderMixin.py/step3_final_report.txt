  "purpose": "Retrieve Twitter API credentials either from environment variables or command-line arguments for use in API interactions.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (TWTR_API_KEY, TWTR_API_SECRET_KEY, TWTR_ACCESS_TOKEN, TWTR_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET); Command-line arguments (--twtr_api_key, --twtr_api_secret_key, --twtr_access_token, --twtr_access_token_secret).",
  "sinks": "Credentials stored in class attributes; no external transmission or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (env vars or CLI args) are assigned to class instance variables for later use.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names; argument parser setup contains syntax irregularities (e.g., invalid default parameters).",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with methods to load credentials from environment variables or CLI arguments, using standard libraries. Variable and class name obfuscation is superficial but could be suspicious. No malicious code, network activity, or data exfiltration is present. The argument parser setup appears malformed, likely due to obfuscation or corruption, but this does not impact the security assessment. The code's purpose is straightforward credential handling, with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign credential loader with superficial obfuscation. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain attacks are evident. The obfuscation scores are justified given the variable naming. The overall security risk is low. The primary concern is secure handling of credentials outside this code fragment, but from this analysis, the code itself is safe.",
