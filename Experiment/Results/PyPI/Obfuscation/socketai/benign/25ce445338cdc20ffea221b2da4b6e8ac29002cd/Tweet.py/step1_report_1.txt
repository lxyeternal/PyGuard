  "purpose": "Defines a class with an initializer method that assigns parameters to instance variables.",
  "sources": "Parameters passed to the __init__ method: KdMQtlsTTXXJBgFLSZOGncbjRUDJWvzQ, NMrGZKNcRAYgnRJPthDuEeZSedewURCJ, wvsvhDkKFfzufomvCHVIhkwiLhUufNNC.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are stored in instance variables; no further data flow or processing shown.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated-like variable names; no visible malicious logic or code execution. The class appears purely structural.",
  "analysis": "The class defines an object with an initializer that assigns three parameters to instance variables, with some defaults. No code execution, data leakage, network activity, or suspicious behavior is present. The variable names are intentionally obfuscated, which may be a superficial attempt to hide intent, but no actual malicious actions are evident. The code is minimal and safe in isolation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple, obfuscated class definition with no malicious behavior or security risks. It likely serves as part of a larger codebase but on its own, it does not pose security threats.",
