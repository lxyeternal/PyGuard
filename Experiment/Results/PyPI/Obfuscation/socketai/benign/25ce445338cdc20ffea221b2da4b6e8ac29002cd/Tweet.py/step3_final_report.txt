  "purpose": "Defines a class with an __init__ method assigning parameters to instance variables.",
  "sources": "Parameters passed to __init__ method, assigned to instance variables.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow directly into instance variables without further processing.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names; no suspicious or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward class constructor that assigns input parameters to object attributes. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious logic are present. Obfuscation of names is superficial and common in code obfuscation practices but does not imply malicious intent. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions suggest benign behavior. Scores assigned in reports (malware=0, low security risk, high obfuscation) are consistent with this analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated data container with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation alone does not indicate malicious intent, and the current scores are appropriate.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
