  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated and handles sensitive credentials, raising security concerns. While no explicit malware is detected, the obfuscation and secret handling could be exploited maliciously. The overall malware score should be around 0.3, obfuscation score about 0.75, and security risk approximately 0.5. Further review and static analysis are recommended before deployment, especially in supply chain scenarios."
