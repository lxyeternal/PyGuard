      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign 'setup.py' script with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The scores are consistent with its simplicity and purpose, warranting a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0."

      "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit signs of malware or malicious sabotage. The primary issues are incomplete implementation, undefined variables, and obfuscation, which could lead to misconfigurations or vulnerabilities if exploited. The malware score is 0, with a moderate obfuscation score (~0.6) and low security risk (~0.3). It should be reviewed for proper variable definitions, input validation, and code clarity before deployment."

      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a configuration API client with significant obfuscation and some coding issues. While no malicious activity is evident, the obfuscation and inconsistent variable usage warrant caution. Further review of the full package, external API endpoints, and runtime behavior is recommended before deployment or trust. The low malware score (~0.2) aligns with the absence of malicious payloads, but the high obfuscation (~0.8) and moderate risk (~0.4) suggest careful scrutiny."

      "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated and handles sensitive credentials, raising security concerns. While no explicit malware is detected, the obfuscation and secret handling could be exploited maliciously. The overall malware score should be around 0.3, obfuscation score about 0.75, and security risk approximately 0.5. Further review and static analysis are recommended before deployment, especially in supply chain scenarios."

      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation and handles sensitive data without validation, with suspicious method names indicating potential concealment of malicious behavior. While no direct malicious actions are confirmed, the pattern of obfuscation and insecure data handling warrants treating this package as potentially malicious. Further static and dynamic analysis is recommended to verify intent."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits significant obfuscation, suspicious method naming, and privilege escalation tactics, indicating a high potential for malicious or covert behavior. While no direct malicious payloads are observed, the patterns strongly suggest malicious intent or at least covert activity. The high malware score (~0.65) and obfuscation score (~0.75) are justified, with a moderate security risk (~0.55) due to poor security practices and potential misuse. Further static and dynamic analysis is recommended to confirm intent, especially examining the implementation of the suspicious method and privilege escalation mechanisms."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits significant obfuscation, suspicious naming, and undefined variables, which could be used to hide malicious behavior. While no explicit malicious payloads are present, the structural anomalies and obfuscation suggest a potential for malicious activity or compromise. It warrants cautious handling, further static and dynamic analysis, and review of the external endpoints and environment variables before deployment. The overall security risk is moderate to high, and the malware likelihood is elevated due to obfuscation, though not definitively malicious."
