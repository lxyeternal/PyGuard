{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up and configure a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it imports a library and calls a function.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists in this minimal setup code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and uses standard setup() with no parameters or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setup' from setuptools and executes setup() with default parameters. This is a common pattern for package configuration. There are no hardcoded credentials, data leaks, malicious commands, or suspicious code. The absence of parameters reduces the risk of malicious configuration. The code does not perform any network, file, or environment variable operations. Overall, this is a standard, benign setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It does not contain obfuscation or malware indicators.",
