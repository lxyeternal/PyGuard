  "purpose": "Minimal setup script for Python package installation using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Import statement from setuptools module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks or external communications.",
  "flows": "Import of 'setup' function, followed by its invocation with no parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setup' from 'setuptools' and calls it without arguments, which is a common minimal pattern for Python package setup scripts. There are no external inputs, no network operations, no obfuscation, and no suspicious behavior. The code is syntactically correct, simple, and aligns with typical usage. All signals indicate benign intent, with no malicious or security-compromising elements present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign 'setup.py' script with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The scores are consistent with its simplicity and purpose, warranting a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0.",
