{
  "purpose": "This code is used to set up and install a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "No input or external data sources are read by this code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed or outputted; setup() may perform package installation routines but not maliciously.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; setup() executes to install package metadata and files.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, containing only an import and a single setup() call; no suspicious or unusual behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the standard 'setuptools' library and calls setup() with default parameters. This is a common pattern for Python package configuration. There are no hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors present. The code does not contain obfuscation, dynamic execution, or unusual constructs. It performs a legitimate package setup function.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security issues. It is straightforward and appears safe.",
