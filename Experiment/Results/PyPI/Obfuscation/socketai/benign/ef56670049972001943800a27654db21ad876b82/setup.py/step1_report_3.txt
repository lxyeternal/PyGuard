  "purpose": "The code is used to configure and initiate the setup process for a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are read within this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or vulnerable points where untrusted data could cause harm are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only calls a setup function.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "This is a minimal setup script that imports the setuptools library and calls setup() with default parameters. It does not include any custom configuration, user input, or dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks are present. The code appears to be standard boilerplate for Python package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, simple package setup code with no malicious intent or security issues detected.",
