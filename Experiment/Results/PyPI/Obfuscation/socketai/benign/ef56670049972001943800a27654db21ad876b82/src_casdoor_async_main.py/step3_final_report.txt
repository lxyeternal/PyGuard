  "purpose": "OAuth2 client SDK for authentication, token management, and user operations.",
  "sources": "Network requests to API endpoints, JWT decoding, URL construction, environment variables for credentials.",
  "sinks": "API responses, JWT tokens, URL query parameters, network data transmission.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (credentials, tokens) flow through API calls and JWT decoding to validate or retrieve data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of undefined variable 'basic_auth' in headers, inconsistent variable naming, incomplete code snippets, potential lack of input validation, and obfuscated variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard OAuth2 client functions, including token exchange, user management, and permission enforcement. Multiple reports identify the use of an undefined variable 'basic_auth', which indicates incomplete or buggy code rather than malicious intent. The obfuscated variable names and inconsistent handling suggest code obfuscation or poor coding practices, but no concrete evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration is present. The JWT decoding uses cryptographic libraries correctly, but the undefined variables and incomplete snippets could lead to misconfigurations. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate OAuth2 client with some bugs and obfuscation, not malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit signs of malware or malicious sabotage. The primary issues are incomplete implementation, undefined variables, and obfuscation, which could lead to misconfigurations or vulnerabilities if exploited. The malware score is 0, with a moderate obfuscation score (~0.6) and low security risk (~0.3). It should be reviewed for proper variable definitions, input validation, and code clarity before deployment.",
