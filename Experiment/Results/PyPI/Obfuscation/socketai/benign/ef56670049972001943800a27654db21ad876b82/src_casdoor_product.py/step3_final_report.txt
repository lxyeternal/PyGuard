  "purpose": "Client-side API wrapper managing product data through HTTP requests, serialization, and deserialization.",
  "sources": "API response data, class attributes, input parameters for API calls.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to API endpoints, data returned from requests, dynamic attribute setting.",
  "flows": "Data flows from class attributes and input parameters into API request payloads, with responses parsed back into class instances.",
  "anomalies": "Typo in request method name 'FanlldaqUZxxgUpXHneRkQkZLDemzqJh' which appears to be a typo or obfuscation; high obfuscation in class and method names.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as an API client for product management, with obfuscated class and method names. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code are evident. The typo in the request method is suspicious but likely a typo or obfuscation, not malicious. The use of dynamic attribute setting and custom request functions suggests obfuscation, but no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or sabotage are present. The network requests and JSON handling are standard. The obfuscation is high but appears to be for concealment rather than malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports—malware near zero, high obfuscation, and low risk—are consistent with this assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a low-risk, obfuscated API client managing product data. No evidence of malware or malicious behavior is present. The obfuscation and typo warrant cautious review but do not indicate malicious intent.",
