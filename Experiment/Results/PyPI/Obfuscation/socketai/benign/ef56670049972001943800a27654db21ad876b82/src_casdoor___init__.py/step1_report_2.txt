  "purpose": "Import specific functions or objects from local modules within the package.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules: .async_main, .main, .user",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; imports are static and do not process untrusted data directly",
  "flows": "No data flow from external untrusted sources; imports are static references",
  "anomalies": "Imported identifiers (zQCQaZYqUGuRmneEqDVkZfpLTwDBCHAv, PbGZHMHNIoUcPrrAssClFyEhVzGCxypq, VVEnYsMoUTLBNxTndZiPdoGyeggqPiwf) are obfuscated or nonsensical, possibly indicating code obfuscation or malicious intent",
  "analysis": "The code performs simple relative imports of functions or objects with obfuscated names. The use of obfuscated identifiers can be a technique to hide malicious logic or make reverse engineering more difficult. There are no visible data flows, network activity, or other malicious operations in this snippet. The pattern of obfuscated names suggests potential malicious hiding, but as static import statements, these alone do not indicate malicious behavior. Further analysis of the imported modules and their contents is necessary to determine intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains obfuscated import identifiers, which could be used to hide malicious code. However, based solely on these import statements, there is no direct evidence of malicious activity. Additional context and analysis of the imported modules are needed to confirm intent.",
