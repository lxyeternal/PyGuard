  "purpose": "Import specific functions or variables from local modules for use within the package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .async_main, .main, .user",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data; standard import statements without dynamic execution",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; simply importing functions/variables",
  "anomalies": "Imports are from relative local modules with obfuscated or nonsensical names, which could be suspicious if intended for concealment; no other anomalies observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports three entities from relative modules, each with seemingly obfuscated names. There is no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no network or file operations. The module structure and import statements are straightforward but use non-descriptive identifiers, which may suggest obfuscation. Since the code only performs imports and no further logic, it does not contain malicious behavior itself. However, the naming pattern warrants caution as it could be used to conceal malicious intent, but based solely on these import statements, no malicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs simple import operations from local modules with obfuscated names. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malicious intent in these statements alone. The use of obscured identifiers warrants further review if more code is available, but based on this snippet, it appears benign.",
