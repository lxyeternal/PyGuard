  "purpose": "Import specific functions or objects from local modules within the package",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .async_main, .main, .user",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; no external data handling or network operations present",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources; merely importing functions or objects for internal use",
  "anomalies": "The imported identifiers (zQCQaZYqUGuRmneEqDVkZfpLTwDBCHAv, PbGZHMHNIoUcPrrAssClFyEhVzGCxypq, VVEnYsMoUTLBNxTndZiPdoGyeggqPiwf) are highly obfuscated, possibly autogenerated or deliberately named to conceal their purpose",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules, importing obfuscated identifiers. There are no visible malicious operations such as network communication, data manipulation, or code execution. The obfuscated names could be benign, but they also could be an attempt to hide malicious intent. No other context is provided, and no suspicious patterns are evident within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is limited to obfuscated imports with no direct malicious behavior or security risks visible. However, the obfuscated names warrant caution, as they may conceal malicious code elsewhere in the module. Based on this snippet alone, the risk appears low, but further investigation of the imported functions/objects and their usage is recommended.",
