  "purpose": "Static import of obfuscated identifiers from local modules, likely to conceal functionality.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.async_main, .main, .user) with obfuscated symbol names.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; only static imports are performed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated, nonsensical identifiers for imported symbols; absence of comments or documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code only performs static relative imports from local modules with obfuscated names, which raises suspicion but does not demonstrate malicious activity. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling is visible. The obfuscation could be used to conceal malicious code or backdoors, but in isolation, it is not definitive. The malware score is low (0.2), reflecting the lack of evidence, while the obfuscation score is high (0.7), indicating suspicion. The security risk score is moderate (0.3), acknowledging the potential for concealment but no active threat. The confidence score is around 0.5, given the limited context.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet appears benign but uses obfuscated identifiers, which warrants further review of the imported modules. No direct malicious activity is evident, and the scores are consistent with cautious suspicion due to obfuscation.",
