  "purpose": "Import specific functions or objects from local modules within the package.",
  "sources": "Import statements reading from local modules: .async_main, .main, and .user.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks are present; no external network or data output observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; purely module imports.",
  "anomalies": "Imported symbols have non-descriptive, obfuscated names, which could be an anomaly. The pattern of import names suggests obfuscation or hiding actual intent. No comments, documentation, or explanation provided.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of three import statements importing symbols with obfuscated names from local modules. No parameters, function calls, or data manipulations are present. The naming pattern of imported objects suggests intentional concealment. No malicious activity such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors is evident in these import statements. However, the obfuscated import names warrant caution as they may be part of a larger obfuscated codebase. The code is minimal and does not directly indicate malicious behavior, but the obfuscation is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated import statements with non-descriptive names, which could be a sign of obfuscation or concealment. No direct malicious activity or security issues are evident from these lines alone. However, the obfuscation warrants further review of the larger code context.",
