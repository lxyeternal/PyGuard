  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, dynamic code execution (eval, exec), network activity, system commands, and data input points.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, system commands, environment variables, file operations, and data leaks.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or input data flow into dynamic execution or network communication points.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation (e.g., encoded strings, misleading variable names), dynamic code execution, network activity, and environment variable reads suggest suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are common indicators of malicious intent. Network activity and environment variable usage further raise suspicion. Benign code lacks these features. Scores reflect these observations: high obfuscation (0.8) in Report 1, moderate suspicion (0.4 malware) aligned with dynamic execution, and low to moderate risk scores in benign cases. Adjustments to lower risk scores in benign reports are justified to match their benign nature. Overall, the suspicion is primarily centered on Report 1, with others showing minimal or no malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code in Report 1 shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, warranting a higher malware score (~0.6) and risk (~0.6). Other reports are benign, with low scores. Final assessment: malware score 0.6, obfuscated score 0.8, overall risk 0.6, aligning with the suspicion level in Report 1.",
