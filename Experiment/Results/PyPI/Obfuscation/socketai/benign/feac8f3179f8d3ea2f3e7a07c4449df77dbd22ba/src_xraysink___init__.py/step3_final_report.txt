  "purpose": "Assigns a version string to the variable __version__ for package versioning.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it is a static assignment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data flows are present; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is a simple assignment with no data movement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple variable assignment of a version string, a common practice in Python packages. It contains no input/output operations, no data flows, and no malicious or suspicious behavior. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as zero with high confidence. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or vulnerabilities. The code's simplicity and clarity confirm its safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version string assignment with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
