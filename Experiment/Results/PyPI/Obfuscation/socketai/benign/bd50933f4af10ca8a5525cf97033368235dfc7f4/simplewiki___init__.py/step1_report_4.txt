{
  "purpose": "The code appears to assign version and name strings to variables, likely part of a package's metadata.",
  "sources": "Variable assignments at the beginning of the code",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; simple assignments",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names with no context, but no malicious indicators",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two variable assignments with obfuscated variable names. No external input, network activity, or code execution is present. No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious logic are detected. The structure is minimal and straightforward, indicating likely metadata or configuration information.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as metadata or package identifiers without any malicious intent or security risks.",
