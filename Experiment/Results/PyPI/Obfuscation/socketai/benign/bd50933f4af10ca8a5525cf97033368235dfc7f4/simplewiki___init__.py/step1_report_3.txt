  "purpose": "Assign version and project name variables, likely for package metadata or configuration.",
  "sources": "Literal string assignments at the beginning of the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; simply variable assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code appears to be basic variable assignments without any suspicious or unusual activity.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns static string values to two variables, which seem to represent version ('2.1.0') and project name ('SimpleWiki'). There are no inputs, no external data sources, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior. The code appears benign and typical for configuration or metadata purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple variable assignment statements with no indication of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to serve as metadata for a package or project.",
