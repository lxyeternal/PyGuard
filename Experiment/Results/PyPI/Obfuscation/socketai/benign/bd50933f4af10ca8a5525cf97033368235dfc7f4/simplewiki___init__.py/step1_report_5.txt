  "purpose": "Assign version and package name identifiers, likely for a package or module.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements at the beginning of the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data flow or external interactions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from assigned variables without any external influence or further processing.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names that appear random or obfuscated; no meaningful identifiers; no code logic or external calls.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two variable assignments with seemingly random or obfuscated variable names. The assigned values are static strings, representing version ('2.1.0') and package name ('SimpleWiki'). There are no functions, no input/output operations, no external network connections, and no evidence of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The code does not perform any actions, making it inert and harmless. The variable names may appear obfuscated but could simply be nonsensical naming conventions; there is no indication of obfuscation intended to hide malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet appears to be simple metadata assignment with no malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any actions beyond setting two variables, and there are no signs of malicious intent or security concerns.",
