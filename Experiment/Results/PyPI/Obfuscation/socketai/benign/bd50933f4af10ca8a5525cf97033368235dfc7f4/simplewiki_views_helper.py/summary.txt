  "conclusion": "The code is obfuscated but appears to be legitimate Django application logic for permission-based menu generation. There is no evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The high obfuscation warrants a higher obfuscated score, but the malware score remains at 0, and the overall security risk is low. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
