  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, reading README.md and configuring package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file, defining dependencies, and package metadata variables.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data or external outputs are directly used.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md -> passing metadata to setup()",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names and misspelled attribute references (e.g., os.OUhlgSVlMOTiaqKYHvTCbbzGLmCnWuzf), which would cause runtime errors unless dynamically defined elsewhere.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script but contains obfuscated variable names and malformed attribute references, indicating either obfuscation or corruption. No malicious code, network activity, or data exfiltration is evident. The obfuscation hampers readability and review but does not, in itself, indicate malicious intent. The code would likely fail to run due to attribute errors unless attributes are dynamically added. The overall behavior is benign, with the main concern being obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard package setup with obfuscation that could be accidental or malicious. No evidence of malicious activity is present. The obfuscation warrants caution, but the code does not demonstrate malicious behavior.",
