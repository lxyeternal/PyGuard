{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, configuring package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.md file for long description; uses environment variables and standard file system operations for file paths and package data.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks that process untrusted input; setup functions use static, predefined metadata and dependencies.",
  "flows": "No flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the file operations and setup parameters are static and hardcoded.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names; unusual import statement with a misspelled attribute 'OUhlgSVlMOTiaqKYHvTCbbzGLmCnWuzf' instead of 'os.path'; inconsistent code style; use of non-standard variable names; no actual code execution of untrusted input; however, obfuscated variable names suggest an attempt to conceal code intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a setup configuration script that reads a README file and specifies package metadata and dependencies. The use of obfuscated variable names and a misspelled attribute in 'os' indicates an attempt to conceal the code's true nature or confuse static analysis tools. There is no evidence of malicious code such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code performs standard setup tasks with static data. The obfuscation is the primary anomaly, but it does not directly suggest malicious behavior. Overall, the script appears to be a legitimate setup script with obfuscation rather than malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, with obfuscated variable names and some unusual code style, but no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation may be an attempt to hide some details, but it does not indicate malicious intent. The overall security risk is low.",
