  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit malicious behavior; the primary concern is obfuscation, which could be used to hide malicious code but is not evidence of such. The malware score is 0, and the security risk is low (~0.2-0.3). The obfuscation warrants caution but does not confirm malicious intent."
