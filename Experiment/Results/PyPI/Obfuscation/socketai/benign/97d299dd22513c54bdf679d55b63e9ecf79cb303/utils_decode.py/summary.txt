  "conclusion": "The script is likely a legitimate audio decoding utility with heavy obfuscation. No direct malicious activity or supply chain attack signs are evident. The main concern is the obfuscation and suspicious module/class names, which warrant cautious monitoring but do not currently indicate malicious intent."
