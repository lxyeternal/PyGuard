The scores assigned are consistent with the analysis, indicating low malware likelihood but moderate obfuscation and risk."

      "conclusion": "The code is suspicious due to the obfuscated module names, which could hide malicious payloads. However, there is no concrete evidence of malicious activity in this fragment alone. Further analysis of the imported modules is necessary to determine their safety. The risk and malware scores should be kept moderate unless additional evidence emerges."

      "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit malicious behavior or supply chain compromise indicators. Obfuscation and unusual mathematical transformations warrant caution but are not definitive signs of malicious intent. The low malware score and low security risk score are appropriate. It is likely a legitimate neural network module with obfuscation for proprietary reasons."

The main concern is the obfuscation and suspicious module/class names, which warrant cautious monitoring but do not currently indicate malicious intent."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard audio encoding pipeline with some obfuscation elements, primarily the suspicious import and variable naming. There is no concrete evidence of malicious activity or supply chain attack. The obfuscation warrants cautious review, but the overall behavior is benign."

      "conclusion": "The dependency shows some dynamic and obfuscated features that warrant attention but no confirmed malicious activity. The scores are consistent with the analysis, indicating low to moderate suspicion. Minor adjustments could increase malware scores slightly if eval/exec are used on untrusted input, but current scores are justified. Overall, the dependency appears relatively benign with potential risks that should be monitored."
