  "conclusion": "The dependency shows some dynamic and obfuscated features that warrant attention but no confirmed malicious activity. The scores are consistent with the analysis, indicating low to moderate suspicion. Minor adjustments could increase malware scores slightly if eval/exec are used on untrusted input, but current scores are justified. Overall, the dependency appears relatively benign with potential risks that should be monitored."
