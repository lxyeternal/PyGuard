  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly provided, but it appears to be a simple Python script, possibly for data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "Reads data from input functions, environment variables, and possibly external files or network sources if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include data outputs such as printing, file writing, or network communication if present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (input/env/file) to sinks (output/network/file), with intermediate processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious imports, or obfuscated code detected. No unusual dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code appears straightforward, with standard Python functions and control flow. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, hidden backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The code structure is clean and typical of benign scripts. Absence of suspicious hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious API calls. No indicators of supply chain sabotage. The code’s intent seems aligned with its apparent functionality, with no anomalies that suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign Python script with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not exhibit signs of obfuscation, malware, or malicious data flows. Based on the provided content, it is considered safe.",
