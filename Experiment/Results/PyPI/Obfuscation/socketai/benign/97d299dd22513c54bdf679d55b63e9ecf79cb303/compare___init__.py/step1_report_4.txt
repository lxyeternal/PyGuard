  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform a specific function or task within a larger application, but without seeing the actual code, the exact purpose cannot be determined.",
  "sources": "The code may read input from user input, environment variables, files, or network requests; specific sources cannot be identified without the code content.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system commands, network communication, file writes, or database operations; specific sinks cannot be identified without the code content.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks possibly through variables or functions; without the code, the specific flow paths cannot be established.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies can be identified without the code; look for hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or obfuscated code, none of which can be assessed here.",
  "analysis": "Insufficient information to analyze the code step-by-step; the analysis depends on actual code content to identify sources, sinks, flows, and anomalies.",
