  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, eval/exec functions, dynamic attribute access, external modules, network interactions.",
  "sinks": "Potential data exfiltration points, network connections, file writes, stdout outputs.",
  "flows": "Sources such as eval/exec or environment variables leading to sinks like network or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec, dynamic code execution, obfuscation, hidden functions, dynamic attribute access, absence of code in some reports.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits dynamic features such as eval and exec, which can be exploited if used on untrusted data. Obfuscation and hidden functions are noted but no concrete malicious activity like data exfiltration, reverse shells, or system damage is observed. Reports correctly identify potential risks but lack definitive malicious indicators. The scores assigned reflect cautious suspicion appropriate for the features present, with malware scores around 0.2-0.4, obfuscation scores around 0.3, and security risks around 0.3. The confidence levels are justified based on the analysis depth and evidence. No significant anomalies or malicious behaviors are confirmed, and the overall assessment remains cautious but not alarmist.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency shows some dynamic and obfuscated features that warrant attention but no confirmed malicious activity. The scores are consistent with the analysis, indicating low to moderate suspicion. Minor adjustments could increase malware scores slightly if eval/exec are used on untrusted input, but current scores are justified. Overall, the dependency appears relatively benign with potential risks that should be monitored.",
