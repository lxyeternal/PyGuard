  "purpose": "Import statements for modules within the same package, possibly for internal functionality or initialization.",
  "sources": "Reading module names for relative imports.",
  "fires": "Import statements can execute code in imported modules, potentially leading to malicious side effects if the modules contain malicious code.",
  "flows": "Import statements invoke the execution of the module code upon import, which may trigger further data access or malicious activity if the modules are compromised.",
  "anomalies": "Module names such as qxYFRXnupKDHuhPjdegSdOOVOgZIJdWg and wpZnnPSXlYAcGkKMDGiHHtmBexOMUXCv are obfuscated, non-descriptive, and resemble randomly generated strings, which is suspicious. The use of relative imports is normal, but the obscure module names are unusual and may indicate obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of relative import statements with highly obfuscated module names, which is uncommon for standard, legitimate packages. Such naming could be an attempt to hide malicious modules or functions. Since these imports execute the module code immediately, any malicious behavior within those modules will be triggered. The third import of 'quantize' appears more normal but could also be part of an obfuscation scheme.",
  "conclusion": "The use of obfuscated module names and reliance on relative imports raises suspicion. These modules may contain malicious code or serve as hidden backdoors. The code itself does not perform any other action beyond importing, but the context suggests a potential security risk if the imported modules are malicious.",
