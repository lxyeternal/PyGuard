  "purpose": "The code imports modules with obfuscated names, likely as part of a larger package, without any additional logic or data handling.",
  "sources": "Relative import statements importing modules with obfuscated or non-descriptive names.",
  "sinks": "Import statements that execute code from the imported modules, which could lead to code execution if those modules are malicious.",
  "flows": "Import statements (sources) trigger execution of code within the imported modules (sinks) upon import, potentially executing malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated module names, which may be an attempt to hide malicious intent or payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for modules with obfuscated names, which can be suspicious. Obfuscation alone does not confirm malicious intent, but it warrants caution. Importing modules executes their code, so if these modules are malicious, they could perform harmful actions upon import. The scores assigned in reports reflect high obfuscation (around 0.75), moderate malware suspicion (around 0.3-0.4), and moderate security risk (around 0.4-0.6). Without further analysis of the imported modules' content, the overall risk remains moderate. The suspicion is primarily due to obfuscation and the potential for malicious code execution during import, but no direct evidence of malicious activity is present in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is suspicious due to the obfuscated module names, which could hide malicious payloads. However, there is no concrete evidence of malicious activity in this fragment alone. Further analysis of the imported modules is necessary to determine their safety. The risk and malware scores should be kept moderate unless additional evidence emerges.",
