  "purpose": "Import statements for modules or subpackages within the current package.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the current package's modules or subpackages.",
  "targets": "Imports modules or submodules; these are standard import statements with no external data flow.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; import statements do not represent data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Imported module names are non-descriptive, potentially obfuscated or intentionally obscure; no obvious secrets or malicious patterns are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code contains three import statements importing modules with seemingly random or obfuscated names. There are no external inputs, user data, or environment variables used. The import statements are standard and do not include dynamic execution or suspicious constructs. Without additional context, these modules may be normal parts of a larger package, but their obscure naming warrants caution. No malicious behavior or malicious code patterns are evident in these import statements alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard import operations with obfuscated module names. Based solely on these lines, there is no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain attack. The obscurity of module names could be benign or malicious, but no concrete indicators are present.",
