{
  "purpose": "Import modules or components from the current package, potentially for further use within the package.",
  "sources": "The 'import' statements read the current package's modules or components named 'qxYFRXnupKDHuhPjdegSdOOVOgZIJdWg', 'wpZnnPSXlYAcGkKMDGiHHtmBexOMUXCv', and 'quantize'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are evident; the code does not process data or execute untrusted input directly.",
  "flows": "The code simply imports specific modules; there are no data flows or execution paths involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "Modules being imported have obfuscated or non-descriptive names, which can be suspicious. No other anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or dynamic code execution are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of three import statements, two of which use highly obfuscated module names. Obfuscated module names can be a technique to hide malicious modules or to evade detection. However, with only import statements and no further code or context, there is no direct evidence of malicious activity. The presence of such module names warrants caution but does not confirm malicious intent on its own.",
  "conclusion": "This code only performs module imports with obfuscated names, which can be suspicious but is not inherently malicious. Without additional context or code, the risk appears low, but the obfuscated modules should be examined further in the full package.",
