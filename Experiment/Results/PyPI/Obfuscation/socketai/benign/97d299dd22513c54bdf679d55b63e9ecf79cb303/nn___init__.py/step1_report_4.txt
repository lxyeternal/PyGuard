  "purpose": "Importing modules or components within the same package",
  "sources": "Module imports from the current package (__init__.py or similar), involving obfuscated or non-descriptive module names",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no data processing or output functions observed",
  "flows": "Imports establish internal dependencies; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Module names like qxYFRXnupKDHuhPjdegSdOOVOgZIJdWg and wpZnnPSXlYAcGkKMDGiHHtmBexOMUXCv appear intentionally obfuscated or randomly generated, which is suspicious and may indicate an attempt to hide malicious activity or payload",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from the current package, referencing modules with seemingly random or obfuscated names. There are no additional code constructs, data handling, or external interactions. The obfuscated module names could be benign, but they are suspicious due to lack of clarity and purpose. Without further context, it's difficult to determine if these imports are malicious, but the obfuscation raises a red flag for potential hidden functionality. No obvious malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code execution is evident here, but the naming warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code's sole function appears to be importing internal modules with obfuscated names, which could be an attempt to conceal malicious behavior or simply a result of code obfuscation. Given only this snippet, the risk is elevated due to the naming but no concrete malicious activity is observable. Further inspection of the imported modules is recommended.",
