{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'unidic2ud' Python package, performing environment detection and dependency configuration based on system specifics.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md'; checks platform via 'platform.platform()'; executes 'mecab-config --libs-only-L' via subprocess; uses environment variables and system info for dependency selection.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks identified; subprocess output used internally for configuration, not for malicious purposes.",
  "flows": "Reads README content -> detects platform -> conditionally sets dependencies -> attempts subprocess call -> configures setup parameters -> executes setuptools.setup()",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; broad exception handling around subprocess call; environment detection logic; no hardcoded secrets or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with environment-aware dependency management. Obfuscated variable names are likely for obscurity, not malicious intent. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code execution detected. Exception handling is broad but typical. The subprocess call to 'mecab-config' is a standard system check. Overall, the script performs typical package setup tasks with some obfuscation, but no malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, environment-sensitive setup script with obfuscated variable names. No signs of malware, backdoors, or supply chain attacks are present. The obfuscation appears superficial and not malicious. The security risk is low, and the malware score should remain at 0. The obfuscation score can be considered high due to variable naming, but this does not imply malicious intent.",
