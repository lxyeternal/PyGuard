{
  "purpose": "Export a set of obfuscated or intentionally unnamed symbols from the module, likely for internal use or API exposure.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a relative module (.unidic2ud) and the __all__ list defining exported symbols.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sources or sinks; the code is primarily defining symbol exports.",
  "flows": "The import of potentially obfuscated symbols from a relative module to the module's namespace, then exporting them via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "All imported symbols are named with non-descriptive, seemingly random strings, which could indicate obfuscation. The code uses only imports and an __all__ list with no functions or executable code. The symbols' names are not meaningful, which could be a sign of hiding intent or simply obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple symbols from a relative module, all named with non-descriptive, seemingly random strings. These symbols are then included in the __all__ list, exposing them for external use. The code does not include any logic, data processing, or data handling, and only serves as an export interface. The pattern of naming and the lack of context suggest intentional obfuscation, but there is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The code appears to be straightforward module symbol export with obfuscated names.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily performs symbol import and export with obfuscated identifiers, which could be an attempt to conceal the module's inner workings. There is no clear evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a standard module export with obfuscated symbol names, possibly for internal or API purposes. No signs of malicious activity are detected.",
