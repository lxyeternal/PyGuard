{
  "purpose": "Export specific obfuscated functions or variables from the unidic2ud module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from a local module '.unidic2ud' and the __all__ list declaration",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data input or output identified",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines exported symbols",
  "anomalies": "The code contains heavily obfuscated variable and function names, which could be used to conceal malicious intent, but no explicit malicious behavior is apparent in this fragment.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several symbols with obfuscated names from a local module and then exposes these symbols via the __all__ list, which controls what is exported when the module is imported elsewhere. There are no signs of malicious activity such as network operations, data exfiltration, or code execution. The obfuscation may be a technique to hide intent, but based solely on this fragment, it appears to be a standard pattern for hiding implementation details.\n\nNo suspicious code behavior, external data handling, or malicious code patterns are evident here. The lack of any additional logic, conditional statements, or network-related code suggests this is a simple, albeit obfuscated, module interface.",
  "conclusion": "The code is an obfuscated module interface with no clear malicious intent. The heavy use of non-descriptive names is suspicious but not necessarily malicious in itself. Without further context or additional code, the risk appears low.",
