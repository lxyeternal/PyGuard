{
  "purpose": "Export specific functions or variables from the unidic2ud module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .unidic2ud, listing imported names and the __all__ assignment.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, external network interaction, or sensitive operations detected.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines exports.",
  "anomalies": "Use of heavily obfuscated variable and function names, which may suggest obfuscation or an attempt to hide intent. No actual implementation code or logic present, only imports and exports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple items from a local module 'unidic2ud' and sets the __all__ variable to include those items for export. The imported names are nonsensical and appear obfuscated, which could be benign or malicious depending on context. There are no functions, data processing, or external communications. The absence of executable logic suggests this is a module's interface definition rather than operational code. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks are evident from this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions solely to export certain functions or variables from a module, with obfuscated names but no functional or malicious logic present. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security threats in this fragment.",
