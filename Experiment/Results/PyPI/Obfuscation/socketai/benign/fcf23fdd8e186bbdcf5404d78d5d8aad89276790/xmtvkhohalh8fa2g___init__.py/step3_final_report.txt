{
  "purpose": "This code exports a set of obfuscated symbols imported from a local module, serving as an interface or API surface.",
  "sources": "Imports symbols from the '.unidic2ud' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "Imports from '.unidic2ud' to the module's namespace, then exports via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated, nonsensical variable names; no comments or logic; no runtime behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal interface exporting obfuscated symbols with no functional logic, data flow, or external interactions. The obfuscation raises suspicion but is not evidence of malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports—malware=0, obfuscated=0.8-0.9, security risk=0.1-0.2—are consistent with the evidence. No malicious activity or security vulnerabilities are detectable in this fragment. The obfuscation could be used to conceal malicious code elsewhere, but based solely on this code, it appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as an obfuscated interface exporting symbols without malicious behavior. The high obfuscation scores are justified; malware scores should remain at 0 given the lack of evidence. The security risk is low but warrants further review of the imported module for hidden malicious code. Overall, the reports' assessments are appropriate and consistent with the code provided.",
