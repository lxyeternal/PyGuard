  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Japanese NLP utility with obfuscation patterns but no signs of malicious activity. The malware score is 0, the security risk is low (~0.2), and obfuscation is moderate (~0.4). It should be used with standard caution regarding obfuscation but does not pose an active threat."
