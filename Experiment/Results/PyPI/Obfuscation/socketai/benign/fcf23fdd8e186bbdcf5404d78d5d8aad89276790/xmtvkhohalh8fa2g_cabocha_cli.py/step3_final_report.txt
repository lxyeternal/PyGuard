  "purpose": "A command-line utility for Japanese language processing, involving argument parsing, dynamic module loading, and visualization features.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments, external libraries ('unidic2ud', 'deplacy'), file inputs.",
  "sinks": "File reading/writing, standard output/error, dynamic module imports.",
  "flows": "Arguments parsed from sys.argv lead to conditional module imports and processing functions; data read from files is processed and output to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic imports within conditionals, obfuscated variable names, complex control flow, but no evidence of malicious activity or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code is a linguistic processing tool that handles command-line arguments, dynamically loads modules based on options, and performs text visualization. No network activity, hardcoded secrets, or system modifications are present. Obfuscation and dynamic imports are used, but these are common in plugin-based NLP tools and do not inherently indicate malicious intent. The static analysis and multiple expert reports concur that there is no evidence of malware or malicious behavior. The obfuscation level is moderate, which warrants some caution, but overall, the code appears legitimate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Japanese NLP utility with obfuscation patterns but no signs of malicious activity. The malware score is 0, the security risk is low (~0.2), and obfuscation is moderate (~0.4). It should be used with standard caution regarding obfuscation but does not pose an active threat.",
