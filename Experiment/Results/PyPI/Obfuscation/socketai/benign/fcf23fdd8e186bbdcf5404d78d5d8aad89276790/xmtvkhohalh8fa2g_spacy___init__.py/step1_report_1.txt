  "sinks": "No direct sinks; only local import statement present.",
  "flows": "Import statement flows from the module to the current namespace.",
  "anomalies": "Importing seemingly random strings as identifiers; no context for these identifiers, possible obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple identifiers with seemingly random, non-descriptive names from a local module. The identifiers appear to be obfuscated or generated strings rather than meaningful variable or function names. There are no visible functions, data processing, or network operations. The import is standard Python syntax, but the naming pattern raises suspicion of obfuscation or potential malicious intent. The code does not execute any actions beyond importing symbols, so it alone does not indicate malicious behavior but the naming warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard import but uses obfuscated and non-descriptive names, which could be indicative of obfuscation or concealment of malicious intent. No direct malicious activity is evident, but the unusual naming pattern warrants further review of the module content.",
