{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific functions or classes from a module named '.unidic2cabocha' and then assigns numeric values to several variables, likely for configuration or indexing purposes.",

  "sinks": "Variable assignments; no direct data sink or output functions observed",
  "flows": "Imported functions/classes are available for use elsewhere; variable assignments are static and do not show data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; no descriptive names; no apparent use of user input or dynamic data; import from a relative module with unusual naming; static numeric assignments",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific entities from a module with a relative import, which could be legitimate. The variables assigned are static integers, possibly representing constants or indexes. There are no signs of malicious data handling, no network activity, no dynamic code execution, and no hardcoded credentials or secrets. The obfuscated variable names may suggest obfuscation or lack of clarity but do not inherently indicate malicious intent. The structure appears straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to perform standard import and variable assignment operations with no evident malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscated variable names alone are insufficient to suggest malicious intent, and there are no indicators of data leakage, network activity, or harmful actions.",
