{
  "purpose": "Import specific functions and define several integer variables, likely for configuration or internal use.",
  "sources": "The import statement from a local module; no other data input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No evidence of untrusted data being processed or data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code simply assigns values to variables.",
  "anomalies": "The imported identifiers are nonsensical, lengthy, and appear obfuscated or auto-generated, which may suggest obfuscation or concealment of intent. The variable names are also random and do not reflect meaningful identifiers.",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions from a local module, which might be benign. However, the imported names are unusual and do not follow typical naming conventions, potentially indicating obfuscation. The assignment of integers to variables is straightforward, with no signs of malicious logic such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden behavior. There are no input sources beyond the import, and no outputs or sinks are evident. Overall, the structure is simple but suspicious due to the obscure naming.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign import and variable assignment, but the nonsensical naming raises suspicion of obfuscation or concealment. There is no direct evidence of malicious behavior or malware in this snippet, though caution is advised if this is part of a larger obfuscated codebase.",
