{
  "purpose": "The code imports functions/classes from a local module (.unidic2cabocha) with nonsensical, obfuscated names and assigns integer constants to variables with similarly obscure names. Its purpose appears to be configuration or internal indexing, with no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the local module (.unidic2cabocha); static variable assignments.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or produce outputs that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "Static import of functions/classes and assignment of constants; no dynamic data flow, input/output, or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "Use of nonsensical, obfuscated variable and function names; import from a module with an obscure name, suggesting obfuscation but not necessarily malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import and assignment snippet with obfuscated identifiers. No signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or dynamic execution are present. The obfuscation is likely intentional or auto-generated, but it does not imply malicious activity. The scores assigned in the reports—malware score of 0, high obfuscation scores (~0.7-0.8), and low security risk (~0.1-0.2)—are consistent with this assessment. The code's benign nature is supported by the absence of suspicious patterns or data flows.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with obfuscation likely for internal or proprietary reasons. No evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain attack is present. The current scores are appropriate and do not require adjustment.",
