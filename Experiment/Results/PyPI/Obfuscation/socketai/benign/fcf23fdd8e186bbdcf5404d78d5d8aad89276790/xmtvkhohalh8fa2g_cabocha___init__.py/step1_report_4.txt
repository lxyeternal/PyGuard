{
  "purpose": "The code appears to import specific functions or objects from a module named '.unidic2cabocha' and then defines several variables assigned to integer values, possibly as constants or configuration values.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the module '.unidic2cabocha' during import.",
  "sinks": "No obvious sinks that process untrusted input or data flows to external systems or effects are present.",
  "flows": "Import statements do not establish data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; variable assignments are static.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, such as dynamic execution, obfuscated identifiers, or suspicious patterns, are evident. The imported names are long and seemingly random, but that alone is not suspicious. Variables are assigned simple integer constants without context or apparent purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions or classes from a module in the same package, which could be benign or part of a larger system. The variable names and assigned values appear to be constants or configuration parameters. There is no evidence of code injection, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior. No network activity, data leakage, or sensitive data handling is visible. The structure is straightforward, and the code lacks complex logic or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code does not exhibit signs of malicious intent or malware. It seems to be part of a module that imports functions and sets configuration variables. No security risks are apparent based on the provided fragment.",
