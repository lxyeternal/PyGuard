  "purpose": "Import specific functions and variables from a local module, and define several variables with numeric values.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module (.unidic2cabocha); variable assignments.",
  "sinks": "Variable assignments do not involve untrusted input or data sinks; no external data flows evident.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; variables are statically assigned numeric values.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual naming conventions, including seemingly random strings and variable names; no meaningful comments or documentation. No external or dynamic data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions and constants from a relative module, which may be legitimate depending on context. The variable names appear obfuscated or randomly generated, with no indication of secret credentials or malicious logic. Assignments are static and straightforward. No indication of data exfiltration, network activity, or malicious behavior. The structure is minimal and typical of obfuscated code or auto-generated scripts, but no clear malicious intent is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple import and variable initialization with obfuscated identifiers. No evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks detected. It may be part of a larger codebase or intentionally obfuscated, but based solely on this fragment, it is unlikely to be malicious.",
