  "purpose": "A test script generating random data, calling an obfuscated function, and asserting output types, with no malicious behavior observed.",
  "sources": "np.random.normal calls generating input data; the imported function 'GlbonrqXoeAWOHTdFdTWbijWWIXYnNQA'.",
  "sinks": "Type assertions on function outputs; no external data or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Random data flows into the imported function; outputs are checked for type correctness.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function and variable names; no external malicious activity or data leaks evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test harness with obfuscated identifiers. No signs of malicious activity such as network access, data exfiltration, or code injection. The obfuscation raises suspicion but is not conclusive of malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated~0.7, risk=0.2) are consistent with the benign appearance but acknowledge obfuscation as a red flag. Given the lack of external malicious indicators, the code is likely safe, though obfuscation warrants cautious suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, obfuscated test script with no evidence of malicious behavior. Obfuscation alone does not imply malicious intent, and the current scores are appropriate. For full certainty, source review of the internal function and dynamic analysis are recommended.",
