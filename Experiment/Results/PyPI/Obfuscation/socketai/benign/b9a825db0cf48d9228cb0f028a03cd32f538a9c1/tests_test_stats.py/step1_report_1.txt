{
  "purpose": "The code is a test function that generates two sets of random normal data, then calls a function from a custom module to process this data, and asserts that the output is of float type.",
  "sources": "np.random.normal() calls generating random data, and the imported function GlbonrqXoeAWOHTdFdTWbijWWIXYnNQA",
  "sinks": "The outputs of the imported function are checked for type, but there are no direct sinks such as network, file, or environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Random data generation flows into the imported function, which produces two float outputs checked by assertions.",
  "anomalies": "The function name and variable names are obfuscated and non-descriptive, which can be suspicious. The imported module's name appears random and intentionally obscure. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code patterns are evident. No unusual or suspicious code behavior such as data exfiltration or network activity is observed.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a straightforward test harness using random data to invoke a function and verify output types. The obfuscated names suggest either code obfuscation or deliberately hidden intent, but no malicious behavior or malware signatures are detected. There are no signs of data leakage, code injection, or harmful actions. The use of random data and standard assertions indicates normal testing activity. The custom function's behavior is unknown, but based solely on this code, there is no evidence of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a normal test script with obfuscated naming, but there are no signs of malicious intent or malware. The overall security risk is minimal, and the code does not exhibit suspicious or harmful behavior.",
