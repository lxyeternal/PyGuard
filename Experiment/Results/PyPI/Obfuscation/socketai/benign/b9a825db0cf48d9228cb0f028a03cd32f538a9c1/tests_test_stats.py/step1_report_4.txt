  "purpose": "The code appears to be a test script for a function within a calculator module, generating random data and asserting the output types.",
  "sources": "np.random.normal() calls for generating random data, importing the calculator module, calling the function GlbonrqXoeAWOHTdFdTWbijWWIXYnNQA",
  "sinks": "Assertions on output types, no untrusted data handling or external data sinks observed",
  "flows": "Random data generated flows into the calculator function, and outputs are validated through assertions",
  "anomalies": "The function name and variable names are obfuscated, which is unusual and may indicate an attempt to hide intent. No sensitive data, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The script imports numpy and a specific function from a module. It generates two arrays of normal distribution data with no external input. It calls the target function with this data, then asserts that the returned values are floats. The obfuscated naming could be a concern, but it does not inherently imply malicious behavior. The code is structured as a standard test, with no signs of malicious activity like data exfiltration, backdoors, or system damage. There are no suspicious network connections, code injections, or environment variable misuse. Overall, the code seems to be a benign test case, despite the obfuscated naming.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a seemingly benign test script for a calculator function, with obfuscated names but no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The use of obfuscation alone is not enough to classify it as malicious, especially in the context of a test script.",
