  "conclusion": "The overall assessment indicates that some reports correctly identify obfuscation and potential risks, with scores reflecting suspicion but no confirmed malicious activity. Slight adjustments could lower malware scores where no explicit malicious code is present, but current scores are justified given the signs of obfuscation and risky data flows. The assessments are coherent and aligned with the evidence."
