  "sources": "Environment variables, command-line arguments, external files, network sources, dynamic execution functions (eval, exec).",
  "sinks": "System commands, network connections, file writes, potential data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Untrusted data from sources to sinks via dynamic execution, network calls, or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation, complex control flow, redundant functions, suspicious variable names, minimal comments, lack of transparency.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and potentially risky data handling, such as dynamic execution and minimal documentation. While no explicit malicious payload (e.g., network exfiltration, backdoors, or data theft) is confirmed, the suspicion warrants cautious scoring. The obfuscation and dynamic code indicators justify elevated scores, but the absence of concrete malicious activity suggests moderate risk and malware likelihood. The scores are consistent with the evidence, with the highest concern in reports highlighting obfuscation and dynamic behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The overall assessment indicates that some reports correctly identify obfuscation and potential risks, with scores reflecting suspicion but no confirmed malicious activity. Slight adjustments could lower malware scores where no explicit malicious code is present, but current scores are justified given the signs of obfuscation and risky data flows. The assessments are coherent and aligned with the evidence.",
