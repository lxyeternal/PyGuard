{
  "purpose": "This code sets up a Python package by reading metadata, dependencies, and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the file system: the current script's directory, 'README.md', and 'requirements.txt'.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks where untrusted data is used in a way that could lead to data leaks or execution of malicious code. The setup() function executes with controlled parameters.",
  "flows": "Data flows from reading 'requirements.txt' and 'README.md' files into variables, then into the setup() function call, which uses these variables to configure package installation.",
  "anomalies": "The function name 'QiWtGWLluUmAYfajbtNrtZarWqfvzUJX' appears obfuscated or randomly generated, which is unusual. Variable names like 'SOZfDDRRZKOAhdKzjhYuRzPLUFvLJfSI' are similarly obfuscated. The use of a function instead of direct code execution is uncommon but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup procedures: reading files and calling setup() with parameters. The obfuscated function and variable names are suspicious and could indicate an attempt to hide malicious intent or simply code obfuscation. However, no malicious behaviors such as network connections, data exfiltration, or code injection are present. The code appears benign and typical for package configuration, aside from obfuscated naming.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup script with unusual naming that may suggest obfuscation but contains no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The overall security risk appears low.",
