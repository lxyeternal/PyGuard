  "malware": 0.0,
  "obfuscated": 0.8,
  "securityRisk": 0.2,
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script that reads 'README.md' and 'requirements.txt' and calls setup() with package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' and 'requirements.txt' files from the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "Passing data into setup() parameters; no untrusted data used in a harmful way.",
  "flows": "File contents flow into variables, then into setup() parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function and variable names; no malicious code detected but obfuscation is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with obfuscated identifiers, which is unusual but not malicious. No network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection is present. The obfuscation raises suspicion but lacks evidence of malicious intent. The malware score is set to 0, obfuscation score high (~0.8), and security risk low (~0.2). The code's benign functionality aligns with the low malware risk, but the obfuscation warrants cautious monitoring.",
  "conclusion": "The package appears benign, functioning as a standard setup script with obfuscated naming. No malicious behavior is evident, but obfuscation is a red flag that should be noted. The scores reflect low malware risk, high obfuscation, and low overall security threat.",
  "model": "gpt-4.1-nano"
