{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package, used to define package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the current directory for 'README.md' and 'requirements.txt' files to obtain description and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data processing that could lead to data leakage or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Reads 'README.md' and 'requirements.txt' files, then passes this data into the 'setup()' function to configure package installation.",
  "anomalies": "The function name 'QiWtGWLluUmAYfajbtNrtZarWqfvzUJX' appears obfuscated and unnecessarily complex; variable names are also nonsensical, which may be an attempt to hide intent. The line setting 'SOZfDDRRZKOAhdKzjhYuRzPLUFvLJfSI' uses a string that appears to be a placeholder but is assigned as a package metadata field, which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical setup tasks: reading files and calling 'setup()' with metadata. The obfuscated function name and nonsensical variable names suggest an attempt to obscure the code, which could be a red flag. There is no evidence of malicious network activity, backdoors, data theft, or other malware behaviors. The code's purpose appears benign but intentionally obfuscated, which warrants cautious review. The script does not exhibit any suspicious behavior beyond obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated naming, likely intended to conceal its straightforward purpose. There is no indication of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not, by itself, imply malicious intent.",
