      "confidence": 0.7,
      "conclusion": "The code snippet is syntactically correct and benign in structure but suspicious due to obfuscated identifiers. There is no direct evidence of malicious activity. The high obfuscation score is justified, but the malware and risk scores should remain low to moderate unless additional malicious indicators are found in the 'calculator' module. Further analysis of 'calculator.py' is recommended to ensure no malicious code is concealed within the obfuscated symbols."

      "conclusion": "Most reports correctly identify the absence of code or benign patterns, assigning appropriate low scores. Report 5 exhibits strong indicators of malicious obfuscation and activity, warranting high scores. Overall, the scoring is consistent and justified based on the evidence provided."

      "confidence": 0.85,
      "conclusion": "The overall assessment indicates that some reports correctly identify obfuscation and potential risks, with scores reflecting suspicion but no confirmed malicious activity. Slight adjustments could lower malware scores where no explicit malicious code is present, but current scores are justified given the signs of obfuscation and risky data flows. The assessments are coherent and aligned with the evidence."
