{
  "purpose": "The code appears to provide statistical analysis functions, including data transformations, t-tests, plotting, and linear regression modeling, likely for data analysis purposes.",
  "sources": "Data inputs for functions such as 'KAQceUgzjbGBlezsrXveDnuvlNWcQRZf', 'bodGVKOUkDDzhkmuRCsZElHKVyZysLyg', 'VDITBkpVXtwOiJFqHexovtvPPkIWZrjf', and 'IouhDrqtFwMshaoTZdRXmkFcaOOmHQpZ' which expect numerical data or dataframes; potential user-supplied data in plotting and regression functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential data outputs include plot display ('show()'), regression model object returns, and t-test results; no data leaks or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Input data to transformation functions, statistical tests, visualization, and regression modeling; no evident dangerous flows or untrusted data being mishandled beyond standard analysis routines.",
  "anomalies": "Functions are straightforward with no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual code constructs. The code uses typical library functions without any suspicious activity or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for scaling hours, conducting t-tests, plotting scatter plots, and fitting linear regression models, all using common libraries like statsmodels, scipy, plotly, and sklearn. No suspicious data handling, secret keys, or malicious operations are evident. All operations are typical for data analysis. The functions appear to perform legitimate statistical tasks without any backdoors or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard data analysis functions without any signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. There are no anomalies, malicious behaviors, or obfuscated code. It appears to be a legitimate analytical script.",
