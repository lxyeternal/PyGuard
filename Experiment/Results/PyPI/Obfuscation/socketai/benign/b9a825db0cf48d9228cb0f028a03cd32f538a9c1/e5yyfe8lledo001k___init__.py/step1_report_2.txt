{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific functions or classes from a local module named 'calculator'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module '.calculator', which reads code definitions from that module.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed; import statement alone does not execute or process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow present; the import simply loads code definitions without executing them or handling external data.",
  "anomalies": "The imported identifiers are long, seemingly random strings or obfuscated names, which could be suspicious. No other code is provided, so potential malicious behavior cannot be fully determined. The obfuscated names might be an attempt to hide malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement from a local module, referencing two symbols with non-descriptive, obfuscated-looking names. There is no additional code, execution, or data handling visible. The unusual naming pattern raises suspicion but does not inherently indicate malicious behavior. Since the imported symbols are not used or executed here, no malicious activity is evident at this point. The context is limited, and the import alone does not perform any malicious action, but the naming warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior; it simply imports potentially obfuscated functions or classes. The unusual identifiers are suspicious but not conclusive. Overall, this snippet alone is low risk but warrants further review of the 'calculator' module.",
