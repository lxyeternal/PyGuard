  "conclusion": "The code snippet is syntactically correct and benign in structure but suspicious due to obfuscated identifiers. There is no direct evidence of malicious activity. The high obfuscation score is justified, but the malware and risk scores should remain low to moderate unless additional malicious indicators are found in the 'calculator' module. Further analysis of 'calculator.py' is recommended to ensure no malicious code is concealed within the obfuscated symbols."
