{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific functions or classes from a local module named 'calculator'.",
  "sources": "The import statement indicates data is read from the 'calculator' module within the same package.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks such as network connections, file writes, or execution of untrusted data in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing specific entities from the 'calculator' module to potentially using them elsewhere; no usage shown here.",
  "anomalies": "Imported identifiers 'KAQceUgzjbGBlezsrXveDnuvlNWcQRZf' and 'bodGVKOUkDDzhkmuRCsZElHKVyZysLyg' are obfuscated, unusual, and suggest potential concealment or malicious intent. The use of such nonsensical or encrypted-looking names is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward import from a local module. The imported names are highly obfuscated, which is often a tactic used to hide malicious code or secrets. Without further context, these names do not correspond to standard functions or classes. There are no apparent data flows, network activity, or other malicious operations in this snippet. However, the obfuscated identifiers warrant caution, as they could be placeholders or conceal malicious behavior.\n\nOverall, the code by itself is minimal and not demonstrative of malicious behavior, but the obfuscated identifiers raise suspicion about possible concealment of malicious code elsewhere.",
  "conclusion": "This import statement alone is not definitively malicious but is suspicious due to obfuscated names. No direct malicious activity is evident in this snippet, but the obfuscation warrants further review of the 'calculator' module to ensure safety.",
