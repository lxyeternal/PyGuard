{
  "purpose": "The code imports two symbols with obfuscated names from a local module named 'calculator'.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads from the local 'calculator' module, specifically the symbols 'KAQceUgzjbGBlezsrXveDnuvlNWcQRZf' and 'bodGVKOUkDDzhkmuRCsZElHKVyZysLyg'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or execute functions. It only performs an import.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or execution paths in this snippet; it simply imports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "The imported identifiers are highly obfuscated, nonsensical, and appear as randomly generated strings, which is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal import statement from a local module, with obfuscated symbol names. No active malicious behavior or data processing is evident. The obfuscation raises suspicion but is not definitive of malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports reflect high obfuscation suspicion (0.7) but low malware likelihood (around 0.2). Without further context, such as the content of 'calculator.py', the risk remains moderate. The import alone does not execute code or handle untrusted data, so the threat level is low but warrants further review of the module's contents.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is syntactically correct and benign in structure but suspicious due to obfuscated identifiers. There is no direct evidence of malicious activity. The high obfuscation score is justified, but the malware and risk scores should remain low to moderate unless additional malicious indicators are found in the 'calculator' module. Further analysis of 'calculator.py' is recommended to ensure no malicious code is concealed within the obfuscated symbols.",
