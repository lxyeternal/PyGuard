  "purpose": "Import specific functions or classes from a local module named 'calculator'.",
  "sources": "Import statement reading from the local module '.calculator'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data; just importing functions/classes.",
  "flows": "Import statement loads functions/classes into namespace; no data flow from external sources or untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "Imported identifiers ('KAQceUgzjbGBlezsrXveDnuvlNWcQRZf' and 'bodGVKOUkDDzhkmuRCsZElHKVyZysLyg') appear as obfuscated or nonsensical names, which could be suspicious, but this alone is not definitive malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a single import statement importing two entities with obfuscated or nonsensical names from a local module. There are no other code statements, data handling, or external network interactions. The obfuscated names could indicate malicious intent or simply poor code hygiene, but without additional context, this appears as a benign import pattern. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are evident in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with obfuscated identifiers. No malicious behavior or security risks are apparent based solely on this snippet. The unusual naming warrants further context, but as it stands, it is not suspicious.",
