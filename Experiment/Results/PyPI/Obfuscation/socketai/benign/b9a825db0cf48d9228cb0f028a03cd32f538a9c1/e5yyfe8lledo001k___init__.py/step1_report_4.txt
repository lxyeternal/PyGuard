  "purpose": "Import specific functions or classes from a local module named 'calculator'.",
  "sources": "Import statement reading from a local module file 'calculator.py' in the same package.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or output operations observed.",
  "flows": "Import statement loads code from 'calculator.py' into the current namespace; no data flow involving external untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The imported identifiers 'KAQceUgzjbGBlezsrXveDnuvlNWcQRZf' and 'bodGVKOUkDDzhkmuRCsZElHKVyZysLyg' are obfuscated, which is unusual and potentially suspicious. The names suggest code hiding or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a single import statement importing two components with obfuscated names from a relative module. The obfuscated identifiers may indicate an attempt to hide malicious intent or functionality, but without further context or code, this is speculative. The import alone is standard in Python, but the obfuscated names warrant caution. No other code, data handling, or network activity is present in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with obfuscated identifiers, which is suspicious but not definitively malicious on its own. Further investigation of the 'calculator.py' module is recommended to determine if malicious code exists. Overall, low confidence in malicious intent based solely on this snippet.",
