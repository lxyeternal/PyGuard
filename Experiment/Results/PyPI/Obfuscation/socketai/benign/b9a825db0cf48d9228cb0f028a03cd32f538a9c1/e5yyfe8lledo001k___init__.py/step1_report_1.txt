{
  "purpose": "The code imports two functions or classes from a local module named 'calculator'.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the local module 'calculator' within the same package.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or could lead to leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports specific functions/classes.",
  "anomalies": "The imported identifiers 'KAQceUgzjbGBlezsrXveDnuvlNWcQRZf' and 'bodGVKOUkDDzhkmuRCsZElHKVyZysLyg' are non-descriptive, lengthy, and appear as obfuscated or randomly generated strings, which is unusual and suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement from a local module, which itself is not inherently malicious. However, the imported names are nonsensical and resemble obfuscated code or generated identifiers. This could indicate an attempt to hide malicious intent or obfuscate the real functionality. No other logic or data processing is present, but the suspicious identifiers warrant caution. No signs of malware or malicious behavior are explicit in this fragment alone, but the obfuscated identifiers are a concern.\n\nWithout additional context, such as the contents of 'calculator.py' or subsequent code, it's difficult to definitively classify this as malicious. The lack of code logic and the presence of obfuscated names suggest possible malicious obfuscation or concealment.\n\nOverall, this is a simple import statement with suspicious identifiers, indicating a moderate security concern due to obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code imports two obfuscated functions or classes from a local module, which appears suspicious due to non-descriptive naming. While no direct malicious behavior can be confirmed from this snippet alone, the obfuscation raises concerns about potential concealment of malicious intent. Further analysis of the 'calculator' module and subsequent code is recommended.",
