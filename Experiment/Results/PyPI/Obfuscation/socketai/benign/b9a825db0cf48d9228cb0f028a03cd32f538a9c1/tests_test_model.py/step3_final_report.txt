  "purpose": "A pytest-based unit test for a machine learning model's predict method, verifying output length and attributes.",
  "sources": "Input numpy arrays used as data for the predict method.",
  "sinks": "The predict method invocation; no external data or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays into the predict method, with output assertions verifying correctness.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names, which are unusual but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward unit test that initializes data, calls a predict method on an obfuscated class, and performs assertions. No external data leaks, network activity, or malicious payloads are evident. Obfuscation raises suspicion but does not imply malicious intent. The code's behavior aligns with benign testing patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign unit test with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. Obfuscation warrants cautious review but does not elevate security risk.",
