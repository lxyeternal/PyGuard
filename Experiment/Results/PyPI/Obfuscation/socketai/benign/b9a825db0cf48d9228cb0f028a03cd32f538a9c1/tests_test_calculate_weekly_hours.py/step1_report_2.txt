  "purpose": "Unit testing the function KAQceUgzjbGBlezsrXveDnuvlNWcQRZf from the myinternshipcalculator2024.calculator module.",
  "sources": "Import statement for the function KAQceUgzjbGBlezsrXveDnuvlNWcQRZf; reading test inputs (integers 7 and 0).",
  "sinks": "Assertions comparing function output to expected values; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "Input integers (7, 0) → function call → assertion check; no external data flow or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function name and class name; invocation of 'unittest.QiWtGWLluUmAYfajbtNrtZarWqfvzUJX()' which does not exist, likely a typo or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward unit tests with obfuscated identifiers. The call to 'unittest.QiWtGWLluUmAYfajbtNrtZarWqfvzUJX()' appears to be an invalid function call, possibly an obfuscation or mistake. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoors. The code is simple, with no hardcoded secrets or unsafe operations. The obfuscated function and class names could be suspicious but may also be a form of code concealment. Overall, the structure suggests benign testing code with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily a unit test with obfuscated identifiers and an apparent typo in the test runner invocation. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The obfuscation could be for concealment but does not appear malicious.",
