  "purpose": "Unit testing for the 'KAQceUgzjbGBlezsrXveDnuvlNWcQRZf' function from the 'myinternshipcalculator2024.calculator' module.",
  "sources": "Import of 'KAQceUgzjbGBlezsrXveDnuvlNWcQRZf' from a local module; execution of the function within test methods.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no network or file operations, no use of untrusted input in vulnerable ways.",
  "flows": "Calls to 'KAQceUgzjbGBlezsrXveDnuvlNWcQRZf' with controlled inputs; no external data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "The function name 'KAQceUgzjbGBlezsrXveDnuvlNWcQRZf' appears obfuscated, but no malicious code or suspicious patterns are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward unittest implementation testing a function from a local module. The test calls pass specific inputs and verify outputs. No suspicious code, network activity, or malicious behavior is evident. The obfuscated function name may be a result of code obfuscation or automatic name mangling, but this alone is not suspicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. The __main__ block appears to call 'unittest.QiWtGWLluUmAYfajbtNrtZarWqfvzUJX()', which is a non-standard and likely undefined method, potentially an obfuscation or typo, but not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple unittest setup with obfuscated naming. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks within this fragment. The strange method call at the end might indicate obfuscation but does not appear malicious.",
