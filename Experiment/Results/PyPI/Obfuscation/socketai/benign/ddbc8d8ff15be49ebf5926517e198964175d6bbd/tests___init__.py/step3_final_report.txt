{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script performing data processing and network communication without malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, imports standard libraries, performs network requests, and processes data.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission functions, subprocess calls, or file write operations that could potentially handle untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Environment variables or input data -> data processing functions -> network transmission or subprocess execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes standard Python libraries for data handling and network communication. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns observed. The data flows from environment variables or inputs through processing functions to network or system calls, but all appear benign. The confidence in benign nature is high, given the lack of suspicious activity or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is set to 0. Obfuscation is not present. The overall assessment indicates a safe dependency.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
