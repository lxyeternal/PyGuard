{
  "purpose": "The code loads a JSON configuration file to retrieve package information and provides a function to return source and destination paths for package installation or setup.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'package.json' file located in the 'labextension' directory relative to the current file",
  "sinks": "None directly; the JSON data is loaded into a variable and used internally in the function",
  "flows": "The code reads data from 'package.json' and uses it within the function to return path information",
  "anomalies": "The code imports an obfuscated variable name from a module, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The script determines the absolute path of the current directory, loads a JSON file named 'package.json' from a subdirectory, and defines a function to return a list with source and destination information. There are no indications of data being sent externally, executing untrusted input, or malicious behavior. The presence of obfuscated variable names might be a minor anomaly, but it does not suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script that reads configuration data and provides path information. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks in the provided snippet.",
