{
  "purpose": "The function searches for 'package.json' files within the current directory and its subdirectories to retrieve the 'version' field.",
  "sources": "The code reads the filesystem starting from the directory of the script (__file__), specifically opening 'package.json' files found during os.walk.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks that process untrusted data into sensitive operations, but reading 'package.json' could potentially leak version info if exploited.",
  "flows": "The code traverses directories (source) and returns the 'version' value from the first 'package.json' found (sink), without further processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behavior; the code does not include obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious network activity. It silently searches and reads files.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a function that walks through the directory tree from the script's location, attempting to open 'package.json' files. If found, it loads and returns the 'version' field. If not found, it raises an error. The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious network calls, or data exfiltration. The only potential concern is information leakage of version details, but this is generally harmless and typical in package management contexts.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a directory traversal to locate 'package.json' files and extract version info. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It appears to be a benign utility function.",
