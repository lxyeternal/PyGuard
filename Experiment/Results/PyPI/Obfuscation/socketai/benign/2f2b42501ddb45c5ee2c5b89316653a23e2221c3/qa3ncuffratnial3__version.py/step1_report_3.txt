{
  "purpose": "The code searches for a 'package.json' file within the current directory tree and returns its 'version' value.",
  "sources": "The code reads the filesystem to locate 'package.json' files starting from the script's directory.",
  "sinks": "The code does not directly write or transmit untrusted data; it only reads local files.",
  "flows": "The code walks through directories (source) and reads 'package.json' files to extract the 'version' field (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. The function name appears obfuscated or randomly generated but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a function that recursively searches for 'package.json' files starting from its directory. It attempts to open each found 'package.json' and extract the 'version' key. If none are found, it raises an error. The code uses standard library modules (json, os) without suspicious or dangerous functions. The function name appears obfuscated, but this alone is not indicative of malicious intent. There are no network operations, data exfiltration, or malicious commands present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a directory traversal and file parsing utility intended to retrieve package version info. It does not contain malicious behaviors or security risks based on the current analysis.",
