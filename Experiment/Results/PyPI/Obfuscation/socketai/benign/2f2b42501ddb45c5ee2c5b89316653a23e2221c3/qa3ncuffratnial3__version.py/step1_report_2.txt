  "purpose": "The function searches for a 'package.json' file within the directory tree starting from the script's location and retrieves its 'version' field.",
  "sources": "Reads the filesystem using os.walk and open, and parses JSON data from 'package.json'.",
  "sinks": "Returns the 'version' value from the JSON file; no external sinks or network operations present.",
  "flows": "Starts at the script directory -> walks directory tree -> opens and reads 'package.json' -> extracts 'version'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code performs standard filesystem operations. No obfuscated or malicious-looking code features.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that locates 'package.json' files by walking through directories starting from the script's location. It attempts to open and parse 'package.json' files, returning the 'version' field when found. If no such file is found, it raises an error. The process is straightforward and does not include any network activity, code injection, or suspicious logic. The code appears to serve a utility purpose of retrieving version info from a package descriptor. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a standard filesystem search for 'package.json' and extracting version information. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
