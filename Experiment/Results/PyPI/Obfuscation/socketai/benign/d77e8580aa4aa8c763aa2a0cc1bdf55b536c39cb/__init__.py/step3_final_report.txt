{
  "purpose": "Minimal Python code importing a version attribute, defining a list with an email, and assigning a configuration string, likely for metadata or configuration purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement for __version__, hardcoded email list, string assignment representing a Django app configuration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, network activity, or data processing observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from static import and hardcoded variables; no dynamic or external data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names and hardcoded email address; no malicious behavior but potential obfuscation or placeholder data.",
  "analysis": "The code is static, minimal, and does not perform any malicious actions. Variable names are non-descriptive, which could suggest obfuscation, but there is no evidence of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, network activity, or code injection. The hardcoded email and configuration string are benign and typical for metadata. The malware score is appropriately set to 0, as no malicious behavior is detected. Obfuscation is moderate due to variable naming but not malicious. Security risk is very low, reflecting the static and benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no evidence of malware or security threats. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the analysis, and no adjustments are necessary.",
