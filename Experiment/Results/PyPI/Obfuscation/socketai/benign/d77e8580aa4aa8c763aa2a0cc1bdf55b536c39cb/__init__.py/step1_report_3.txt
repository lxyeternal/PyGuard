{
  "purpose": "Import version information from a specific Python module and define variables with static values.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the import statement (`__version__`) and the hardcoded list containing an email address.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; no data is written or transmitted to untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "No significant data flow from sources to sinks; the imported version is not utilized further, and the list/email are static.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a hardcoded email address and seemingly random variable names; no dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version string from a module, which is standard. The variables assigned contain static data: an email address and a string representing a configuration class. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident. Variable names appear obfuscated but are consistent with non-malicious obfuscation or automatic generation. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or credential theft identified. Overall, the code appears benign and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. The hardcoded email could be for informational purposes. No evidence of malware or security threats present.",
