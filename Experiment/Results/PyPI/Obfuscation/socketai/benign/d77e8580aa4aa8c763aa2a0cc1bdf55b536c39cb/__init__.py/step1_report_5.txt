{
  "purpose": "The code imports a version attribute from a third-party module and assigns a list of an email address and a string to variables, possibly for configuration or metadata purposes.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the version from the 'cmsplugin_filer_file' package; the variables are assigned static data.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident data sinks where untrusted input is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "The imported version is stored but not used; the email address list and string are statically assigned without further processing.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a variable containing an email address may suggest data collection or privacy concern, but it appears to be static data. No obfuscated code, malicious patterns, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version attribute from a package, which is common for version tracking. It then assigns a hardcoded email address to a variable, which could be a contact or metadata. The second variable assigns a string that resembles a Django app configuration. No dynamic execution, input reading, or suspicious data handling is present. The static email and configuration string do not indicate malicious intent; they might serve legitimate purposes like metadata or configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving mainly as metadata or configuration data. No evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or malicious code. The presence of a hardcoded email may warrant privacy consideration but is not inherently malicious.",
