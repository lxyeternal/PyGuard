{
  "purpose": "The code imports a version attribute from a specific package and defines two variables, one with an email address and another with a string referencing a Django app configuration.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the import statement (__version__) and the hard-coded email address in the list.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks that lead untrusted data to external systems or outputs.",
  "flows": "The imported version is stored internally; the email address is assigned to a variable, and the string is stored in another variable. No flow from untrusted sources to sinks is apparent.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a hard-coded email address could be used for contact or tracking, but is not inherently malicious. The variable names appear obfuscated but do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version attribute from a package, likely for version checking or compatibility. It then assigns an email address to a variable, possibly for contact or identification. Another variable stores a string referencing a Django app configuration. No data is transmitted externally, nor are there suspicious functions or obfuscated behaviors. The email address could be a privacy concern if misused, but no malicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be straightforward, with no obfuscated code or malicious intent. The presence of a hardcoded email is a minor concern but not malicious.",
