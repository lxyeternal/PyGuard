  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, typical Django CMS plugin for image display with configurable options. No evidence of malicious activity, sabotage, or supply chain compromise is detected. The obfuscation observed is likely due to code generation or minification, not malicious intent. Overall security risk is low."
