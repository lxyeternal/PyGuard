  "sinks": "None detected; no data output, network calls, or external effects",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; static code with simple attribute assignments",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class name and attribute names, which is unusual but not necessarily malicious; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django AppConfig subclass with obfuscated class and attribute names. It sets a string value for a plugin identifier and assigns a localized string for display purposes. The code appears to be intentionally obfuscated through non-descriptive naming but follows standard Django patterns. No malicious code, network activity, or security risks are evident. The obfuscation could be a red flag for concealment but is not conclusive of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard Django configuration with obfuscated identifiers. It does not contain malware or security threats. The obfuscation is suspicious but not inherently malicious. No security risks are detected based on this snippet.",
