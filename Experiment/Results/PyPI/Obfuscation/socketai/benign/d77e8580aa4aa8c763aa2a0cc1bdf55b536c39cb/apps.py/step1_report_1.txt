  "purpose": "Define a Django application configuration with localized verbose name.",
  "sources": "Import statements and the class attribute assignment",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly handles untrusted input or data sinks; the code primarily sets configuration variables.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code initializes class variables with static values.",
  "anomalies": "Use of an obfuscated class name and attribute names, which do not follow typical naming conventions. The translation function _() is used but without evident malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django AppConfig subclass with obfuscated class and attribute names, possibly to hide intent. It imports Django utilities and sets static strings, including a translation. No user input, data leakage, or external communication is present. The code does not perform any actions beyond configuration setup, and the use of obfuscated identifiers could be suspicious but may also be a form of obfuscation or code styling. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Django app configuration with obfuscated naming. There is no malicious behavior or security risk detected. The obfuscation may be intentional for concealment but does not indicate malicious intent in this context.",
