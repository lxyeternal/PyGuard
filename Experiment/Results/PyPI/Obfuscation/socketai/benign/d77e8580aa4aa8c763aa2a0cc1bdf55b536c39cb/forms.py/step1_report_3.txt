  "sources": "Imports from Django, custom widget AttributesWidget, and the model RrvKQdopqBAXRQwyGKiJRopjfUEKWuSi; initialization of the form and widget assignment.",
  "sinks": "Assignment of AttributesWidget to a form field 'link_attributes'.",
  "flows": "Form initialization assigns AttributesWidget to 'link_attributes' widget, with data flow from form instantiation to widget setup.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obscure class and variable names, but no suspicious or malicious code patterns are present. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or data exfiltration activities observed.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a Django ModelForm with a custom widget for a specific form field. The naming obfuscation appears intentional but does not indicate malicious behavior. No external data input is directly processed in a suspicious manner. The widget assignment is standard practice for customizing form rendering. No unusual data flows or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate Django form setup with obfuscated variable names. There are no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
