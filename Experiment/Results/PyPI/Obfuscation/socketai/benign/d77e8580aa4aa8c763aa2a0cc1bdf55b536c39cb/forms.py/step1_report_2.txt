  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no unusual code behavior observed; uses dynamic widget assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a ModelForm class with a nested class for form configuration, and assigns a custom widget to a form field during initialization. There are no suspicious data flows or malicious code actions. The use of dynamic widget assignment appears standard for customizing form behavior in Django.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical Django form customization without malicious intent or security risks. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data handling are present.",
