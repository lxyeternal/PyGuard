  "purpose": "A Django CMS plugin for image handling, resizing, linking, and rendering templates.",
  "sources": "Reads input from context, instance attributes, and settings related to image properties and configurations.",
  "sinks": "Template rendering, URL generation, and static file references; no external network or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from instance and context attributes through rendering functions to output images and links; no suspicious external data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with nonsensical class and method names; no malicious code, network activity, or credential handling identified.",
  "analysis": "The code is a heavily obfuscated Django CMS plugin managing images, with functions for resizing, linking, and template selection. No signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data leaks, or backdoors. Obfuscation appears to be stylistic or proprietary rather than malicious. The logic aligns with standard image plugin operations, and no vulnerabilities or malicious payloads are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, obfuscated Django CMS image plugin with no detected malware or malicious activity. The obfuscation, while high, does not indicate malicious intent based on current analysis. The security risk is low, and malware score remains at zero.",
