  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code reading environment variables, file I/O, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), network connections, and data handling functions.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, system commands, environment variables, file system, and data outputs that could leak information or execute malicious payloads.",
  "flows": "Input sources such as environment variables or files flow into processing functions, potentially reaching network or system commands via eval, exec, or subprocess calls.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval/exec, obfuscated code segments, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious network connections. Minor obfuscation noted in some reports.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits typical patterns for benign scripts with straightforward data handling. Reports with eval/exec and obfuscation suggest moderate suspicion but lack confirmed malicious payloads. Scores are generally consistent with the described code features. Report 2 shows some obfuscation and dynamic execution, warranting a slightly elevated malware score (0.3). Other reports are clean, with scores reflecting minimal risk. No evidence of sabotage or malicious activity detected.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with minor obfuscation and no confirmed malicious intent. Report 2's features justify a cautious approach, but overall, the dependency is low risk. Adjusted malware score to 0.2 and obfuscation to 0.3 for Report 2 to reflect suspicion without overestimating threat.",
