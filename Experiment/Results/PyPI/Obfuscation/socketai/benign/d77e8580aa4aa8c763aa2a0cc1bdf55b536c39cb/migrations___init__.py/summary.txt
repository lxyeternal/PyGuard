  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with minor obfuscation and no confirmed malicious intent. Report 2's features justify a cautious approach, but overall, the dependency is low risk. Adjusted malware score to 0.2 and obfuscation to 0.3 for Report 2 to reflect suspicion without overestimating threat."
