No evidence of malicious activity, sabotage, or supply chain compromise is detected. The obfuscation observed is likely due to code generation or minification, not malicious intent. Overall security risk is low."

The obfuscation raises suspicion but is not definitive proof of malicious intent. The empty reports provide no additional insights. Overall, the code appears benign but warrants further review if obfuscation is unexpected."

Adjusted malware score to 0.2 and obfuscation to 0.3 for Report 2 to reflect suspicion without overestimating threat."

The obfuscation warrants attention but does not constitute a security threat. The scores are consistent with this assessment, and no immediate action is necessary."
