{
  "purpose": "The code appears to parse and process XBRL financial reports, extracting various financial data points and transforming XML/HTML content into structured objects.",
  "sources": "Reading input files via file handles, reading content with self.fh.read(), regex searches for specific tags and attributes in the XML/HTML content.",
  "sinks": "Parsing functions that process HTML/XML content; data transformations and attribute extractions; logging outputs and exception handling outputs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file content reading (sources) into regex and XML/HTML parsing (sinks), with subsequent data extraction and object population (flows), and logging or exception raising based on validation (sinks).",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic regex patterns with seemingly obfuscated or generic patterns; complex nested parsing logic; extensive use of regex with non-trivial patterns; no hardcoded secrets or credentials observed; some variables with misleading names and unusual class/variable structure, possibly obfuscation or auto-generation.",
  "analysis": "The code conducts complex parsing of XML/HTML content, extracting various financial statement elements, with multiple regex searches for specific tags and patterns. It includes dynamic date calculations, context references, and extensive data structuring into classes. It does not appear to perform any network activity, system modifications, or hidden operations. The structure and naming may be intentionally obfuscated or auto-generated, but no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, remote access, or destructive actions are evident. The use of regex patterns and parsing logic seems aligned with typical financial report processing, although some variable names are intentionally misleading or obscure, possibly to hinder easy understanding.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a comprehensive parser for XBRL financial reports, structured to extract and organize financial data. It does not contain malicious behavior or sabotage indicators. The complex and obfuscated style may be for code obfuscation or auto-generation, but no malicious signals or malware behavior are present.",
