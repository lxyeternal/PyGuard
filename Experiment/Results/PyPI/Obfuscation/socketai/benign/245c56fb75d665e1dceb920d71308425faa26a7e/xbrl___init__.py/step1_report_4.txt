{
  "purpose": "The code appears to import functions or classes from a local module named 'xbrl'. It also defines a tuple with three integer values.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the module '.xbrl' during import statements.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks such as network calls, file writes, or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "The import statements read from the module; the tuple assignment is a simple variable assignment with hardcoded values.",
  "anomalies": "The imported identifiers are long, nonsensical, or obfuscated names, which could suggest obfuscation or malicious intent. The module name '.xbrl' is suspicious, as leading dots are unusual unless in specific relative import contexts, but it may also be a standard relative import.",
  "analysis": "The script imports several entities from a local module 'xbrl', using names that seem arbitrary or obfuscated. The code then assigns a tuple of integers to a variable. There are no data flows involving untrusted input, no network activity, no code execution beyond imports. The import line and variable assignment are straightforward. The naming conventions and obfuscated identifiers could be an attempt to hide malicious logic, but in isolation, they are not conclusive. The code is minimal and does not perform any visible malicious actions.\n\nNo functions, data processing, or external communication are present. Without additional context or code, the maliciousness cannot be confirmed but the obfuscated import names warrant caution.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a simple import and variable assignment with obfuscated names. While the identifiers are suspicious, there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet alone. The presence of obfuscated names suggests possible concealment, but no active malicious actions are apparent.",
