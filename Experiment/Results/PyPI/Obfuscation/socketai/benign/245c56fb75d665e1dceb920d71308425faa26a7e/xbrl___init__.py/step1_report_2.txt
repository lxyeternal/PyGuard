  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a larger module importing functions or variables from a submodule named 'xbrl'. It does not perform any direct actions within this snippet.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing functions or variables from '.xbrl' module",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; no output, network, or data manipulation observed",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow is visible within this snippet",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated or nonsensical function/variable names (e.g., shNFuLARpvLLUxQuooGcodLxGrZliVqJ) and the import of potentially meaningless identifiers; no apparent purpose",
  "analysis": "The code imports several identifiers with obfuscated or nonsensical names from a module named '.xbrl'. It then assigns a tuple (1, 1, 0) to a variable. There are no other operations, data processing, or external interactions present. The import names do not correspond to standard or recognizable functions, and the purpose is unclear. The variable names and function names suggest possible obfuscation, but there is no explicit malicious activity or suspicious behavior in this fragment. The code could be part of a larger obfuscated or malicious package, but based solely on this snippet, there is no evidence of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet appears to be a simple import and variable assignment with obfuscated identifiers. There is no indication of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities within this fragment. The obfuscated names and import style suggest possible obfuscation, but no malicious activity is evident.",
