{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that imports specific functions or variables from a local package 'xbrl' and defines a tuple variable, possibly for configuration or internal use.",
  "sources": "The code reads the local package 'xbrl' and the tuple assigned to 'ZPJbtCCakxlZZAkcEQKBtpfTAEKpxLHE'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports and defines a tuple.",
  "anomalies": "The imported identifiers are long, seemingly random, and obfuscated, which is unusual and may suggest obfuscation or concealment of intent. The variable name 'ZPJbtCCakxlZZAkcEQKBtpfTAEKpxLHE' is also nonsensical, which can be an indicator of obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions or variables from a local module 'xbrl' with obfuscated names, which could be an attempt to hide malicious or sensitive code. The defined tuple 'ZPJbtCCakxlZZAkcEQKBtpfTAEKpxLHE' is simple and does not execute any malicious operations. There are no visible data processing, network communication, or security-sensitive operations. The obfuscated naming raises suspicion but does not conclusively indicate malicious behavior on its own.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal and primarily involves obfuscated import statements and a tuple assignment. While the obfuscated names may suggest an attempt to conceal functionality, there is no direct evidence of malicious activity or security risks in this fragment alone. Further context would be necessary to determine intent.",
