{
  "purpose": "Minimal import statements with obfuscated identifiers and a tuple assignment, likely part of a larger package.",
  "sources": "Imports from '.xbrl' module, variable assignment to a tuple.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, no data flows to external systems or sinks.",
  "flows": "Imports and variable assignment; no data flow to external or sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated or nonsensical identifiers, minimal code with no functional operations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several components with obfuscated names from a local module, then assigns a tuple to a variable with an obfuscated name. There are no network calls, data processing, or suspicious operations. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not demonstrate malicious intent. The minimal code and lack of data flow suggest low security risk. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware activity is not evident. The code appears benign but warrants caution if part of a larger, unknown package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is obfuscated but does not show any evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation is likely intended to conceal complexity but does not imply malicious intent. Overall, the security risk is low, and no immediate action is necessary.",
