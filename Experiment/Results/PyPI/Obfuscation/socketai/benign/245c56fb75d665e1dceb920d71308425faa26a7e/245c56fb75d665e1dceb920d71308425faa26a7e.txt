It performs legitimate data extraction and normalization without any signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The high obfuscation is likely for concealment or intellectual property reasons, not malicious intent. The static analysis supports a benign assessment with low security risk."

The suspicion warrants caution, but the evidence does not justify high malware or risk scores. Further analysis of the external 'xbrl' module and context is recommended."
