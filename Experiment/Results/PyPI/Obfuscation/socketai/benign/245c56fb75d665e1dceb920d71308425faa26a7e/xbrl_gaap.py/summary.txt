  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated and processes data in a manner that could be benign or malicious. There is no definitive malicious activity detected. The suspicion warrants caution, but the evidence does not justify high malware or risk scores. Further analysis of the external 'xbrl' module and context is recommended."
