  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package related to parsing XBRL documents and financial data.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' file if it exists; importing setup modules; reading hardcoded string values.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or executed; no network, file, or system command execution observed.",
  "flows": "No flow of untrusted input to critical functions or data leaks; the code primarily reads static files and defines package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variable names (e.g., rHgOSlGetaANFjFJSSzeSwWCTSWsspbD, ZPJbtCCakxlZZAkcEQKBtpfTAEKpxLHE, XJJpKJzdXOTdcdSrqwjzFMTOOlxpDfmy) that seem intentionally confusing or auto-generated; no other suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup procedures for a Python package, attempting to import modules with fallback options. It reads a 'README.rst' file if present, and defines package metadata with obfuscated variable names. The dependencies listed are common open-source libraries and pose no risk. The use of obfuscated variable names might suggest code hiding or attempts to conceal intent but does not directly indicate malicious behavior. There are no indications of data exfiltration, malicious network activity, or dangerous code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names that do not compromise security. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this code fragment.",
