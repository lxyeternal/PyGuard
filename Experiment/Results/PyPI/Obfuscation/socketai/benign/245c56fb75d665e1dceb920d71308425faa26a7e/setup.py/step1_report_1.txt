  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package related to parsing XBRL documents and financial data.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.rst' file from disk.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data or perform insecure operations.",
  "flows": "Reading the README file content during setup, but no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names (e.g., rHgOSlGetaANFjFJSSzeSwWCTSWsspbD, ZPJbtCCakxlZZAkcEQKBtpfTAEKpxLHE, XJJpKJzdXOTdcdSrqwjzFMTOOlxpDfmy), which do not reflect meaningful names and may indicate obfuscation or attempt to hide intent. No other suspicious code or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard setup process, importing necessary modules and reading a README file if it exists. Variable names are intentionally obfuscated, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No external network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is evident. The code only manages package metadata and dependencies. No malicious or suspicious operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names, possibly for obfuscation or privacy reasons. No malicious intent or security risks are detected based on this code fragment.",
