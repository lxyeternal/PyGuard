  "purpose": "Define setup configuration for a Python package related to parsing xbrl documents and financial file formats.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' file if it exists.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; setup configuration is standard.",
  "flows": "Reading file content from 'README.rst' into a variable that is not used elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are obfuscated or nonsensical, which is unusual but not necessarily malicious. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code. No use of untrusted input beyond reading a file that is potentially static.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import setup tools, falling back if necessary. It reads a README file if present, but does not process or transmit this data elsewhere. The setup parameters include package metadata with obfuscated variable names, but no harmful actions or data leaks are evident. The use of obscure variable names could be an attempt at obfuscation, but it does not appear malicious. No code injection, network activity, or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names. No malicious behavior, supply chain attack, or security risks are detected. The only unusual aspect is the variable naming, which does not affect security.",
