  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging a library related to parsing XBRL documents.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.rst' file if it exists; uses hardcoded package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external data sinks; no network or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Reads local file 'README.rst' into a variable, then passes metadata to setup() without further data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; suspiciously random package name 't0rzrn728dx6jmsw'.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with obfuscated variable names, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. It performs standard package metadata assignment and dependency declaration without any network activity, data leaks, or code execution beyond setup. The obfuscation and package name could be attempts to hide intent, but no malicious behavior is evident. The malware score is appropriately 0, as no malicious code or activity is detected. The obfuscation score is high (~0.8), justified by variable naming. The security risk score is low (~0.2), considering the obfuscation and suspicious package name but no active threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign setup script with obfuscated variable names and a suspicious package name. No malicious activity or security vulnerabilities are evident. The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not constitute malicious intent based on this fragment.",
