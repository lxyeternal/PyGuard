      "obfuscated": 0.6,
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names and version extraction via exec(). No evidence of malicious behavior or malware is detected. The main security consideration is the trustworthiness of the '__init__.py' file, as executing code from it could be risky if compromised. The overall security risk is low, with a malware score of 0 and a moderate obfuscation level. It is recommended to replace the exec() pattern with safer alternatives if security is a concern."

      "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated, flexible data management framework with potential misuse vectors. It does not currently exhibit malicious activity based on static analysis but warrants caution due to obfuscation and dynamic features. Scores should reflect low malware risk (~0.15), high obfuscation (~0.75), and moderate security risk (~0.35). Continuous monitoring and runtime analysis are recommended if integrated into sensitive environments."

      "conclusion": "The code functions as a typical adversarial training component with significant obfuscation. No explicit malicious activity is evident, but obfuscation and suspicious naming raise concerns. The overall security risk is moderate, and malware likelihood remains low but warrants further inspection of external modules and runtime behavior."

The main concern is obfuscation and potential misuse of checkpoint files, but these do not constitute active threats. Therefore, the malware score is 0, obfuscation is moderate, and overall security risk is low."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of utility routines for machine learning workflows. Despite obfuscated identifiers, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The overall security risk is very low, with the main concern being obfuscation, which could be used to conceal malicious intent if combined with other malicious code. The malware score is set to 0.1 to reflect the minimal risk associated with obfuscation, and the obfuscated score is 0.6 due to the significant obfuscation present. The security risk score remains low at 0.2."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for filtering and formatting data with obfuscated naming. No malicious activity or supply chain compromise is evident. The obfuscation is notable but does not constitute malicious intent based on this snippet. Scores should reflect low malware risk and moderate obfuscation caution."

No explicit malicious activity is detected, but the use of pickle serialization over network and obfuscation warrants caution. Overall malware risk is low, obfuscation is high, and security risk is moderate due to serialization practices."
