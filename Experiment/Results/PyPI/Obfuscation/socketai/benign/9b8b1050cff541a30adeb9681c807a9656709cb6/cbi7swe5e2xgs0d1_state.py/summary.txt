  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated, flexible data management framework with potential misuse vectors. It does not currently exhibit malicious activity based on static analysis but warrants caution due to obfuscation and dynamic features. Scores should reflect low malware risk (~0.15), high obfuscation (~0.75), and moderate security risk (~0.35). Continuous monitoring and runtime analysis are recommended if integrated into sensitive environments."
