  "purpose": "Utility class for filtering dictionary keys based on include/exclude patterns and formatting associated values.",
  "sources": "Pattern matching on input keys, reading from class attributes such as formats, include_keys, exclude_keys, and input dictionary items.",
  "sinks": "Formatting output values; no external sinks or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Input dictionary flows through filtering functions (exclusion/inclusion), then values are formatted and returned.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names; no hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads; pattern matching logic is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward data filtering and formatting utility with obfuscated naming. It filters keys based on patterns, then formats associated values. No network, file, or system modifications are present. Obfuscation may be an attempt to hide intent but does not inherently indicate malicious activity. The logic is benign, and no suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, network connections, or malicious payloads are detected. The malware score should be minimal, and the security risk is low. The obfuscation warrants caution but is not sufficient evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for filtering and formatting data with obfuscated naming. No malicious activity or supply chain compromise is evident. The obfuscation is notable but does not constitute malicious intent based on this snippet. Scores should reflect low malware risk and moderate obfuscation caution.",
