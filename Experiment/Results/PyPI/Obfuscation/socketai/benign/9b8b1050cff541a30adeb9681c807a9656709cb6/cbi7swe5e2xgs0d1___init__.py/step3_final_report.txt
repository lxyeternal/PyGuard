{
  "purpose": "The code sets a version string and imports internal modules/functions with obfuscated names, likely for internal use or obfuscation purposes.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version string; internal module imports with obfuscated identifiers.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, external network activity, or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code only performs static imports and variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names; no dynamic code execution or external data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module initialization with a version string and multiple internal imports using obfuscated names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection. The obfuscation appears superficial, possibly auto-generated or for code protection, but does not indicate malicious intent. The malware score is appropriately set to 0, and the security risk is low. The obfuscation score reflects the presence of obfuscated identifiers but is not necessarily suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with superficial obfuscation and no malicious activity detected. The current scores are appropriate and do not require adjustment.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.6,
