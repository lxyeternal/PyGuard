{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set a version string and import various modules and functions from within the package, likely for internal use.",
  "sources": "Reading the version string assignment; importing modules and specific functions or classes from submodules",
  "sinks": "No evident untrusted data sinks; imports are static and do not process untrusted input",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code solely performs imports and assigns a string",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names with seemingly random strings; no comments or documentation; no explicit malicious behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version string and imports multiple internal modules and functions, possibly obfuscated by the use of non-descriptive names. There are no dynamic code executions, no network activity, and no handling of untrusted data. The naming scheme might be suspicious, but it can also be a result of obfuscation or automatic code generation. Overall, there are no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a straightforward internal import setup with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious activity, supply chain attacks, or security risks based solely on this snippet.",
