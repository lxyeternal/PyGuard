  "purpose": "Utility functions for data processing, file management, and model parameter control, primarily used in ML workflows.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, file paths, and model parameters; creates and renames files.",

  "flows": "Source data (environment, files, model parameters) flows into functions that modify or handle files and model states.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names; use of temporary files with predictable naming conventions; complex data handling without clear context.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions common in ML pipelines, such as weighted dictionary updates, temporary file handling, and freezing/unfreezing model parameters. Obfuscation of names raises suspicion but does not inherently indicate malicious intent. File operations and model modifications are standard practices. No network activity, data exfiltration, or system commands are present. The obfuscation could be a tactic to hide malicious code, but no evidence supports this. The functions are straightforward and serve legitimate purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of utility routines for machine learning workflows. Despite obfuscated identifiers, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The overall security risk is very low, with the main concern being obfuscation, which could be used to conceal malicious intent if combined with other malicious code. The malware score is set to 0.1 to reflect the minimal risk associated with obfuscation, and the obfuscated score is 0.6 due to the significant obfuscation present. The security risk score remains low at 0.2.",
