  "purpose": "Logging setup, progress tracking, and experiment management utilities for machine learning workflows.",
  "sources": "Parameters, environment variables, and internal data structures used for logging and progress updates.",
  "sinks": "Console output, log files, external loggers (tensorboard, wandb). No network activity or data exfiltration detected.",
  "flows": "Input parameters and internal data flow into logging functions and progress classes, with outputs to console/files.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and class names, but no malicious intent; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises standard logging and progress tracking utilities with complex naming conventions. No network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. Obfuscation appears stylistic, not malicious. The code uses common practices for experiment logging in ML workflows, with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as utility functions/classes for logging and progress reporting. No malicious intent or security risks are evident. Obfuscation is superficial and stylistic, not malicious. Overall, the code is safe for use.",
