  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for a Python package, extracting version info from __init__.py, reading README and requirements, and configuring package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'flashy/__init__.py', 'README.md', and 'requirements.txt'.",
  "sinks": "Executes a line from '__init__.py' to obtain __version__, reads files for metadata.",
  "flows": "Source files (__init__.py, README.md, requirements.txt) -> data extraction and setup() call.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on '__init__.py' for version extraction; obfuscated variable names; minimal error handling for README.md.",
  "analysis": "The script employs a common pattern of extracting version info via exec(), which is generally safe if the source is trusted. Obfuscated variable names suggest an attempt to hinder readability but are not inherently malicious. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. The reliance on exec() introduces a potential security risk if the '__init__.py' file is compromised, but this is a standard practice in many setup scripts. The obfuscation level is moderate to high, but not indicative of malicious intent. Overall, the code appears to be a typical, benign setup script with some obfuscation and a standard version extraction pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names and version extraction via exec(). No evidence of malicious behavior or malware is detected. The main security consideration is the trustworthiness of the '__init__.py' file, as executing code from it could be risky if compromised. The overall security risk is low, with a malware score of 0 and a moderate obfuscation level. It is recommended to replace the exec() pattern with safer alternatives if security is a concern.",
