  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the Python project 'flashy', including reading version info, requirements, and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading the __init__.py file for version, reading README.md for long description, reading requirements.txt for dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no untrusted data being used in sensitive operations or external calls.",
  "flows": "Version info is extracted via exec, description and requirements are read from files, then used in setup().",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec to execute code read from a file (__init__.py). If __init__.py contains malicious code, this could execute arbitrary code during setup.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical setup operations: reading version info, long description, and dependencies from files. The use of open() and exec() on the __init__.py file is standard for version extraction but can be risky if __init__.py contains malicious code. No other suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident. No network operations or data exfiltration observed. The code is straightforward but the use of exec warrants attention, especially if the __init__.py file is compromised.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script appears standard for Python packages but relies on executing potentially untrusted code from __init__.py for version extraction. If __init__.py is malicious, this could lead to arbitrary code execution during package setup. No other malicious behavior detected.",
