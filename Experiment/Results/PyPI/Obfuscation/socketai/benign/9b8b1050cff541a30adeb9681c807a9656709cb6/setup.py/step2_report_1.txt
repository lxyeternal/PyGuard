  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects: presence of malicious code, the use of 'exec', obfuscation, and the overall security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard setup script; reads version via executing a line from `__init__.py`. No malicious code or network activity detected. Obfuscated variable names are present but consistent with typical setup scripts.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — minor concern due to executing code from `__init__.py`, but overall low risk.\n- **Obfuscation:** 0.2 — minimal, mostly variable naming.\n- **Verdict:** The report's assessment appears accurate. No malicious behavior is evident. The use of `exec()` is standard but warrants trust in the source files.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights the use of `exec()` on `__init__.py` for version extraction as a potential risk. If `__init__.py` contains malicious code, executing it could be dangerous.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — but this underestimates the potential risk if `__init__.py` is compromised.\n- **Security risk:** 0.4 — more cautious, acknowledging that executing code from an external file can be risky.\n- **Obfuscation:** 0 — not explicitly mentioned but implied by the variable naming.\n- **Verdict:** Correctly points out the potential danger of using `exec()`. The actual code appears benign, but the risk depends on the trustworthiness of `__init__.py`. The malware score remains at 0, which is acceptable given the context.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizes the `exec()` usage and standard setup practices. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — low, but notes the `exec()` concern.\n- **Obfuscation:** 0 — not explicitly mentioned.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. The code is typical for package setup, with the `exec()` being the only point of concern, which is common but should be used with caution.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Notes obfuscated variable names and the use of `exec()` on `__init__.py`. Recognizes that executing only the line with `__version__` minimizes risk but acknowledges potential concerns.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — cautious but consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscation:** 0.7 — high, consistent with the variable naming pattern.\n- **Verdict:** The assessment is reasonable. The obfuscation and `exec()` pattern are standard but could be exploited if `__init__.py` is malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, notes the obfuscation and use of `exec()` for version extraction. Concludes the script is benign.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — very low, given the context.\n- **Obfuscation:** 0.8 — high, matching the variable naming pattern.\n- **Verdict:** Consistent and reasonable. The script appears benign, with the main concern being the trustworthiness of `__init__.py`.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0, which is appropriate given no malicious code or network activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** Scores are high (0.7-0.8), reflecting the variable naming, which seems to be an intentional obfuscation or a pattern to hinder readability.\n- **Risk scores:** Mostly low (0.1-0.4), with the main concern being the use of `exec()` on external files, which is a known security consideration but common in setup scripts.\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0.75** — high obfuscation, but consistent with the pattern.\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** — minor concern due to executing code from `__init__.py`, but generally acceptable if the source is trusted.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The setup script is standard, with obfuscated variable names and the use of `exec()` for version extraction. No malicious behavior is evident, but the use of `exec()` warrants caution, especially if the source files are compromised. The overall security posture is low risk, assuming the source files are trustworthy.",
