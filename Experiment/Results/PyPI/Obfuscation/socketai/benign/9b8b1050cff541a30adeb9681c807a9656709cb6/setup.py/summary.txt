  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names and version extraction via exec(). No evidence of malicious behavior or malware is detected. The main security consideration is the trustworthiness of the '__init__.py' file, as executing code from it could be risky if compromised. The overall security risk is low, with a malware score of 0 and a moderate obfuscation level. It is recommended to replace the exec() pattern with safer alternatives if security is a concern."
