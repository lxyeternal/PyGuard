  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple Python script that imports standard modules and performs basic operations.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the environment variables, standard input, or function arguments.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to the console or writes to files; uses network connections or subprocesses if present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (environment variables, stdin) through processing functions to outputs (print, file write).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious imports, or obfuscated code detected. No unusual behavior or backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard library modules, performs straightforward processing, and does not include any suspicious or malicious code patterns. No signs of data exfiltration, malicious network activity, or backdoors are evident. The code structure is clean and typical for a benign script.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet. It appears to be a benign utility or example script with no malicious intent.",
