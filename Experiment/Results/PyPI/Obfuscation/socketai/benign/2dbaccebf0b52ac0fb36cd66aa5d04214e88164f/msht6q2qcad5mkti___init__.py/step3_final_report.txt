  "purpose": "Analysis of Python code for malicious behavior, focusing on dynamic execution, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Input data from user inputs, environment variables, network sources, or files.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network transmissions, file modifications, or system commands triggered by untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources through processing functions, potentially reaching sinks via eval, exec, or network calls.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec, high obfuscation, complex control flows, hardcoded secrets, or misleading variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits patterns such as eval/exec usage, obfuscation, and complex control flows in some reports, indicating potential malicious intent. Benign scripts lack suspicious features. Scores are generally aligned with behaviors: low malware likelihood unless confirmed, high obfuscation where noted, and moderate security risk where dynamic code or obfuscation exists. The assessments are consistent, with no evident overestimation or underestimation of threats.",
  "conclusion": "Most scripts are benign; however, scripts with obfuscation and dynamic eval/exec should be reviewed cautiously. The current scores appropriately reflect the observed behaviors, with a slight increase in malware suspicion for heavily obfuscated or dynamically executed code. Overall, the threat level remains moderate, emphasizing the need for further static and dynamic analysis before deployment.",
