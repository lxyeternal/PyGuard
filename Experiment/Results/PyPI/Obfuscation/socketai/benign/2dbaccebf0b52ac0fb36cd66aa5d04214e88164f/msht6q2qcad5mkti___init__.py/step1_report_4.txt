  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script intended for data processing or utility functions, with no explicit purpose indicated by comments or function names.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function parameters and possibly from environment variables or external files if present (not shown). No clear external data input points are evident in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Outputs are sent to console via print statements or written to files; network calls or system commands are not explicitly visible.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (parameters, environment) through processing functions to output or storage points; no suspicious source-to-sink paths are identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. No obfuscated or unusual language features are detected. No malicious or hidden code behavior is apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward with standard Python syntax. It does not include dynamic code execution, obfuscated constructs, or suspicious library usage. It does not perform any network activity, system modification, or data exfiltration. Without additional context or external dependencies, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the analysis, the code appears benign and does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It is a typical utility script with no indicators of compromise or sabotage.",
