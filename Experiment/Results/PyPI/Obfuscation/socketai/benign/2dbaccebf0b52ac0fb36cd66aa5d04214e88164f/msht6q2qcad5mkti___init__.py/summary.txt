  "conclusion": "Most scripts are benign; however, scripts with obfuscation and dynamic eval/exec should be reviewed cautiously. The current scores appropriately reflect the observed behaviors, with a slight increase in malware suspicion for heavily obfuscated or dynamically executed code. Overall, the threat level remains moderate, emphasizing the need for further static and dynamic analysis before deployment."
