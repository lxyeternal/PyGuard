  "purpose": "Setup configuration script for packaging a Python project, including reading README and requirements files.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' and 'requirements.txt' files from the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "Uses the data from the files in the setup() call; no untrusted input is processed or executed directly.",
  "flows": "File contents are read into variables and then used as arguments in setup(), which is a standard practice.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names that appear obfuscated or randomly generated; no explicit malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' for package setup, reads a README file and a requirements file into variables with non-descriptive names, then calls setup() with these variables. The code structure is minimal and typical for setup scripts, with no dynamic execution or external code injection. The variable names are unusual but do not indicate malicious intent. There are no hardcoded credentials, network operations, or suspicious behaviors. The code does not appear obfuscated beyond the naming, which might be a result of code generation or obfuscation, but it does not conceal malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The unusual variable names do not compromise security but could hinder readability. Overall, the script appears benign.",
