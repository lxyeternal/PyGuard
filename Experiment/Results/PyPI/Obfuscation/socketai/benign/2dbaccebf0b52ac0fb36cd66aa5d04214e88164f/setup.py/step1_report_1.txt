  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, reading README and requirements files to configure installation.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description, reads 'requirements.txt' for dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; no use of environment variables, system calls, or external data sources.",
  "flows": "Reads static files, passes dependencies list to setup() function, no dynamic code execution or data flows.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names (e.g., XVZRgamJYmQfsnZqwOxysWjlmyWyRwFO, ubCfPKOBZGXAcBRgBBBrrzamCLMmbbxD, SIvBuvXtcDxvMWaxxrZaHYOYRQEaTZjJ), which are unusual and suggest obfuscation or concealment. The code does not perform any meaningful logic beyond file reading and setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical Python setup configuration with highly obfuscated variable names. It reads two files ('README.md' and 'requirements.txt') and passes their contents to the setup() function. There are no suspicious code behaviors such as network access, system modification, or dynamic code execution. The obfuscation of variable names raises suspicion, but the overall logic remains within the bounds of a standard setup script, albeit intentionally obfuscated. No malicious or malicious-looking behavior is apparent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a deliberately obfuscated setup script with no direct malicious behavior. The obfuscation could be intended to conceal malicious intent, but based solely on the provided code, there is no evidence of malware or security risks. It is recommended to review the actual files ('README.md' and 'requirements.txt') and ensure no malicious content exists there. Overall, the code is likely a benign setup configuration with obfuscation.",
