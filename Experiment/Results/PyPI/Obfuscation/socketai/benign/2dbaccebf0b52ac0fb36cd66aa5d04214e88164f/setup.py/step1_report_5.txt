  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, reading README and requirements files to configure installation.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' and 'requirements.txt' files from the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "File reads from the local filesystem to assign content to variables, then passed to setup() parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; no clear reason for such naming. No signs of malicious code or suspicious logic. No hardcoded credentials, network calls, or external data transmission.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools. It reads content from README.md and requirements.txt files, then calls setup() with those values. Variable names are intentionally obfuscated, but their usage is straightforward and consistent with normal setup practices. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or suspicious code flows. The script appears to be legitimate for packaging a Python project, albeit with obfuscated variable names that could obscure intent, but no malicious intent is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a typical setup script for packaging, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation seems superficial and does not impact the security assessment.",
