  "purpose": "Set up configuration for a Python package distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' and 'requirements.txt' files from the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is being executed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Reads input files ('README.md', 'requirements.txt') and passes dependencies to setup() function.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are obfuscated or nonsensical, but this alone is not malicious; no secrets or backdoors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard setuptools functions to configure package installation. It reads content from 'README.md' and 'requirements.txt' and passes the dependency list to setup(). The variable names are intentionally obfuscated, but their usage appears straightforward. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network communication, credential handling, or code execution. The code is minimal and conventional, aside from the obfuscated variable names which seem to serve no malicious purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard package setup script with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided code.",
