  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for package configuration, reading README.md and requirements.txt files.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' and 'requirements.txt' files into variables with obfuscated names.",
  "sinks": "Passes variables to setuptools.setup(), including a suspicious non-standard parameter.",
  "flows": "File reading → variable assignment → setup() call with parameters, including the suspicious argument.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; use of a non-standard, nonsensical parameter 'SIvBuvXtcDxvMWaxxrZaHYOYRQEaTZjJ' in setup().",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with obfuscated variable names, which reduces readability but does not inherently indicate malicious intent. The suspicious parameter is non-standard and could be an obfuscation tactic or malformed argument. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or malicious code is present. The obfuscation and malformed parameter warrant caution but do not confirm malicious behavior. The malware score remains at 0, reflecting no evidence of malicious activity. The obfuscation score is high (~0.7), consistent with variable naming. The security risk score is low (~0.2), given the lack of active threats or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names and a suspicious, non-standard parameter. There is no evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. The obfuscation and malformed argument should be further verified in the actual source context, but based on the provided snippet, it is likely benign.",
