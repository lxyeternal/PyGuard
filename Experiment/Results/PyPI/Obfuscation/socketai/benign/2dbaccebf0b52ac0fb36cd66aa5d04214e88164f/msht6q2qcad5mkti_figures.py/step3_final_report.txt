{
  "purpose": "The code performs data visualization and network graph analysis related to neural network activations, likely in a medical or research context, utilizing pandas DataFrames, numpy arrays, and custom modules.",
  "sources": "Data read from pandas DataFrames and numpy arrays, external modules 'utils', 'max_act_diff', 'calculations', and 'tgcnn_act_graph' for processing and analysis.",
  "sinks": "Visualization outputs via matplotlib and networkx; no external data exfiltration or system modifications detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input DataFrames and arrays through utility functions into visualization and graph construction routines, culminating in plotted graphs.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names, use of custom modules with unknown contents, but no malicious patterns or secrets identified.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily for data analysis and visualization, with heavy obfuscation in naming but no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data theft, or sabotage. The obfuscation is suspicious but could be due to auto-generation or proprietary reasons. No external system interactions or malicious code patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated ~0.7-0.8, risk=0.2) are consistent with the observations. The code's purpose aligns with legitimate research routines, and no anomalies suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, if obfuscated, data analysis and visualization script with no evidence of malicious activity or malware. The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not justify a malware classification. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score should remain at 0.",
