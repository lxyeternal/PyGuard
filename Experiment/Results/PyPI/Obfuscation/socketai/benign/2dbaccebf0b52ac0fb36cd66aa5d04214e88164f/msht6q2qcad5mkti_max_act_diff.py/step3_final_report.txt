  "purpose": "Analyze Python code performing data analysis on 4D numpy arrays related to patient graphs and filters, with visualization and statistical summaries.",
  "sources": "Input arrays 'pat_graphs' and 'filters', external modules 'calculations' and 'figures' for computations and plotting.",
  "sinks": "No external data leaks, network activity, or file operations; data processed internally within the code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays through nested loops and calculations, with results stored in a DataFrame and optionally visualized.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated variable names, but no suspicious strings, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs legitimate statistical and data processing tasks typical of neural network activation analysis. Obfuscated variable names hinder readability but do not imply malicious intent. No network, file, or system manipulation observed. External modules are used appropriately, and no suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration or code injection are present. The high obfuscation score is justified, and malware risk is minimal. Verbose output is controlled by a flag and does not indicate malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign data analysis routine with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation is likely for internal concealment or code compression, not malicious intent. Overall, the supply chain security risk is low.",
