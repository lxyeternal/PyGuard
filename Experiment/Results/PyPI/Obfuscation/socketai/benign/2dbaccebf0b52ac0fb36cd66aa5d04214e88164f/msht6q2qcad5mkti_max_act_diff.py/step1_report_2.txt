{
  "purpose": "The code performs a series of computations on 4D patient graph data and filters, calculating maximum activations and differences for analysis or visualization purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from parameters: 'pat_graphs', 'filters', 'ZidPDSgGRnsuESpPSrSuzCfZIEvLqWnn' (list), and 'verbose'/'show_plot' flags. Reads shape information from 'pat_graphs' and 'filters'.",
  "sinks": "Outputs a DataFrame with computed maximum activations and differences; potentially outputs plotting functions, but no data is transmitted externally or written to external systems.",
  "flows": "Input data is processed through nested loops, performing element-wise and slice operations, culminating in aggregation and optional plotting; no untrusted external data flows back or to network.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious strings observed. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code features detected. No signs of malicious data exfiltration or system commands.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly manipulates numpy arrays, DataFrames, and visualization functions. It computes maximum activations from input graphs and filters, then calculates differences between activations for each filter. The data processing appears standard, with no suspicious code patterns, no network communication, and no file manipulations. Functions import external modules ('calculations', 'figures'), but their internal behavior is not provided. No indication of hidden backdoors, malicious payloads, or sabotage mechanisms. The code's logic aligns with typical data analysis workflows in machine learning or signal processing contexts.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign data analysis routine with no malicious intent or security risks. It processes and visualizes statistical differences in input data without involving external communications or sensitive data handling beyond standard arrays and DataFrame operations.",
