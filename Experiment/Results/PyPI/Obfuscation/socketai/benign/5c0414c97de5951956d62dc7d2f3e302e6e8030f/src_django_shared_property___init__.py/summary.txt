  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static data storage with obfuscated variable names. There is no malicious activity, data leakage, or dynamic behavior. Obfuscation is superficial and does not pose a security threat. Current scores are appropriate; malware score is 0, obfuscation around 0.6, and risk at 0.1. Slightly lowering obfuscation scores could better reflect the benign nature, but overall, the assessment remains valid."
