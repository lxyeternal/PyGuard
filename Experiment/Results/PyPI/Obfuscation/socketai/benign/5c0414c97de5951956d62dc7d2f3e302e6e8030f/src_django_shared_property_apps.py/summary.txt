  "conclusion": "The dependency contains signs of obfuscation and dynamic code execution, indicating a moderate to high likelihood of malicious intent, particularly in Report 1. Other reports lack evidence of malicious activity, and their scores are appropriate. The overall security risk is elevated in Report 1, with a malware score of 0.6, obfuscation score of 0.8, and risk score of 0.7, aligning with the observed indicators."
