  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, network connections, subprocess calls, standard input/output, environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Network endpoints, file system, environment variables, subprocess execution.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or network data flow into processing functions, potentially leading to data exfiltration or command execution sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation, dynamic eval/exec with untrusted data, hardcoded secrets, unusual variable naming, lack of code clarity, signs of concealment.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits obfuscation and dynamic code execution, which are common indicators of malicious intent. It reads from environment variables and network sources, with potential data exfiltration pathways. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious network domains are observed. The code structure suggests concealment tactics. The absence of eval/exec in some reports reduces suspicion, but the presence of obfuscation and dynamic execution in others raises concern. Overall, the signs point toward possible malicious behavior, especially in Report 1, which shows strong obfuscation and dynamic code signs.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency contains signs of obfuscation and dynamic code execution, indicating a moderate to high likelihood of malicious intent, particularly in Report 1. Other reports lack evidence of malicious activity, and their scores are appropriate. The overall security risk is elevated in Report 1, with a malware score of 0.6, obfuscation score of 0.8, and risk score of 0.7, aligning with the observed indicators.",
