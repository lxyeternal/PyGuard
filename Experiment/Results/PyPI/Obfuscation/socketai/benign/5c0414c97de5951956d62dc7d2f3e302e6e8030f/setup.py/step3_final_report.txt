  "anomalies": [

    "incomplete 'long_description' value causing syntax error"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with obfuscated variable names, which may be superficial. The 'long_description' field is incomplete, leading to a syntax error, but no malicious code or external data flows are present. No dynamic behaviors or network activity are detected. The obfuscation does not appear to be used maliciously, and the syntax error is likely an oversight rather than an attack vector.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration with superficial obfuscation and a syntax error. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain attack. The obfuscation may hinder review but does not imply malicious intent. The main issue is fixing the syntax error for proper execution.",
