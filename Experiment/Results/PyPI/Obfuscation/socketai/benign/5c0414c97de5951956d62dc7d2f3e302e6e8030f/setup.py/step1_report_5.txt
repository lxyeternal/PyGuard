  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 't4vbvd0x8nuzss5u', including metadata and package data.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings, dictionary definitions, and package metadata; no external data sources or user input detected.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function is called with package configuration data; no untrusted data sinks or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the flow is static configuration data passed to setup().",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names, incomplete 'long_description' (missing string or data), and non-standard naming may suggest obfuscation or concealment. No malicious code such as network access, system modification, or data exfiltration detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs package setup with obfuscated variable names and minimal logic. It defines package metadata and configuration in a typical setup.py pattern, except for the strange variable naming and missing 'long_description' value. No code reads external input, writes data, or performs suspicious actions. The obfuscated names could be an attempt to hide intent, but no malicious behavior is evident. The code is static and serves a standard packaging purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names and incomplete fields. There is no indication of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The obfuscation is likely intended to conceal details but does not imply malicious intent.",
