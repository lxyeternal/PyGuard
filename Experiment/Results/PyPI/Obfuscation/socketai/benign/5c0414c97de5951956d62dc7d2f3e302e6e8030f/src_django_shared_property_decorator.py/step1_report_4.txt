{
  "purpose": "The code declares the source file encoding as UTF-8 but contains no further logic or functionality.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data processing or output points are present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows exist due to absence of code logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of an encoding declaration comment with no executable code, which is unusual and provides no operational purpose.",
  "analysis": "The provided code only contains a single line specifying the file encoding, which is a standard comment in Python files. There are no variables, functions, data inputs, or outputs. The lack of executable code means there are no potential attack vectors, data flows, or malicious behavior present. The minimal content raises questions about whether the code was truncated or improperly extracted, but based solely on this fragment, there is no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is essentially empty aside from a standard encoding declaration. It does not perform any operations, handle data, or include suspicious elements. No malware or security risks are evident from this snippet.",
