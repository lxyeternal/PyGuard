{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a minimal script with only a coding declaration and no functional implementation.",
  "sources": "No input or data sources are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points are present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow is observable due to the absence of executable statements.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a coding declaration; no actual logic, data processing, or function calls are present. This could indicate an incomplete or placeholder script.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a coding declaration comment specifying UTF-8 encoding. There are no variables, functions, imports, or executable statements. Without additional code, there are no apparent security concerns, malicious behavior, or suspicious patterns. The minimal nature of this script suggests it is either a template, a placeholder, or an incomplete snippet. No source-to-sink flows, anomalies, or malicious activities can be inferred.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It is a very minimal and benign code fragment with no executable logic.",
