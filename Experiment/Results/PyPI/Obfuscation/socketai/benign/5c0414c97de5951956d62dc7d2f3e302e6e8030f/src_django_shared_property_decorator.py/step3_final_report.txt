  "purpose": "This code snippet contains only a UTF-8 encoding declaration comment, serving as a placeholder or minimal file with no executable logic.",
  "sources": "The code reads no input or external data; it is a comment line.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flows exist, as the code contains only a comment with no logic or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code is an extremely minimal placeholder, but this is not suspicious; it is a common pattern for template or auto-generated files.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single comment line indicating UTF-8 encoding, with no executable statements, data sources, or data sinks. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The absence of logic, data flow, or suspicious patterns means there is no malicious intent or security risk. The malware score is appropriately zero, obfuscation is not present, and the security risk score is justified as zero. Confidence in benign nature is high, given the simplicity of the code. No anomalies or malicious indicators are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal placeholder with no malicious behavior or security issues. All reports' assessments and scores are accurate and consistent with the code content.",
