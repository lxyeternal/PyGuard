      "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration with superficial obfuscation and a syntax error. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain attack. The obfuscation may hinder review but does not imply malicious intent. The main issue is fixing the syntax error for proper execution."

      "conclusion": "The dependency contains signs of obfuscation and dynamic code execution, indicating a moderate to high likelihood of malicious intent, particularly in Report 1. Other reports lack evidence of malicious activity, and their scores are appropriate. The overall security risk is elevated in Report 1, with a malware score of 0.6, obfuscation score of 0.8, and risk score of 0.7, aligning with the observed indicators."

      "conclusion": "The code is a highly obfuscated, complex ORM extension intended for sophisticated query manipulation. There is no evidence of malicious activity or malware. However, the heavy obfuscation and complexity pose a security concern, especially if untrusted input influences its behavior. It should be reviewed carefully in context before deployment, and input validation should be enforced to prevent injection or misuse."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is benign, static data storage with obfuscated variable names. There is no malicious activity, data leakage, or dynamic behavior. Obfuscation is superficial and does not pose a security threat. Current scores are appropriate; malware score is 0, obfuscation around 0.6, and risk at 0.1. Slightly lowering obfuscation scores could better reflect the benign nature, but overall, the assessment remains valid."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is a highly obfuscated utility for AST analysis and dynamic code generation, capable of executing arbitrary code if misused. While no direct malicious payloads are present, its complexity and dynamic features pose significant security risks, especially in untrusted environments. The overall assessment indicates moderate to high risk primarily due to obfuscation and dynamic execution capabilities, warranting cautious handling."
