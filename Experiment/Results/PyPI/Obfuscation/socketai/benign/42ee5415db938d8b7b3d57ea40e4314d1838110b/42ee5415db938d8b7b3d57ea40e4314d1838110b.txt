      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, obfuscated API client library with no active malicious activity. The main security concern is the handling of 'endpoint' parameters, which could be exploited if inputs are malicious. Ensuring strict validation of 'endpoint' URLs is recommended. Overall, the supply chain risk is low; the obfuscation and flexible endpoint handling warrant caution but do not constitute malicious activity."
