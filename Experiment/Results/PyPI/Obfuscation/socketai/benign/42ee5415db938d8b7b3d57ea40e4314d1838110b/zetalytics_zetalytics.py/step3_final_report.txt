  "purpose": "Python API client with parameter validation and dynamic request handling.",
  "sources": "Functions accepting 'endpoint' parameters and request URL construction.",
  "sinks": "Requests sent to URLs constructed from 'endpoint' parameters, potential for redirection if manipulated.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (including 'endpoint') flow into URL concatenation, leading to network requests.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated method and class names; dynamic 'endpoint' parameters concatenated without strict validation.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a structured API client with extensive parameter validation, including token length enforcement. No hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads are evident. The primary concern is the flexible 'endpoint' parameter used in request URL concatenation, which could be exploited if controlled externally. Obfuscation of method names is suspicious but not malicious. No signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or sabotage are present. The malware score is appropriately low (0), but the security risk score should be moderate (~0.4) due to potential misuse of unvalidated 'endpoint' inputs. Proper validation of 'endpoint' URLs would mitigate this risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, obfuscated API client library with no active malicious activity. The main security concern is the handling of 'endpoint' parameters, which could be exploited if inputs are malicious. Ensuring strict validation of 'endpoint' URLs is recommended. Overall, the supply chain risk is low; the obfuscation and flexible endpoint handling warrant caution but do not constitute malicious activity.",
