  "purpose": "Import the Zetalytics class from the zetalytics.zetalytics module, likely for use in API interactions or data analysis.",
  "sources": "Import statement pulling the Zetalytics class from a package/module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code only imports a class without executing or passing data.",
  "flows": "No data flows observed; import statement alone does not process untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; only an import statement with no further code or suspicious patterns. The package name 'zetalytics' could be legitimate or potentially suspicious if unknown, but the code itself is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement importing a class from a module. No functions, data handling, or execution occurs. There are no apparent malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, code execution, or backdoors. The code is very minimal and does not present any security risks on its own.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a simple import statement with no malicious intent or suspicious activity. It does not pose a security risk but is too minimal to fully assess the trustworthiness of the package. Based on this, it is considered safe.",
