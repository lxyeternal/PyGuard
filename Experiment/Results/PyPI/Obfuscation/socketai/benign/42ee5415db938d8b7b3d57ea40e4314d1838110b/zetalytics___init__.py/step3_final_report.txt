  "purpose": "This code imports the Zetalytics class from the zetalytics.zetalytics module, likely for use in analysis or data processing tasks.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the module 'zetalytics.zetalytics' and the class 'Zetalytics' within it.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any actions that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "The source is the import statement; there are no data flows or execution paths beyond loading the class into the namespace.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is a straightforward import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement, which is standard in Python. It does not contain any obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. The import does not involve untrusted data, network activity, or system modifications. The security and malware scores are appropriately low (0), reflecting the benign nature. The confidence in this assessment is high (0.9), given the simplicity of the code. No anomalies or risks are identified, and the code's purpose appears to be to utilize the Zetalytics class for legitimate analysis tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are consistent with this assessment, and no further action is necessary based solely on this snippet.",
