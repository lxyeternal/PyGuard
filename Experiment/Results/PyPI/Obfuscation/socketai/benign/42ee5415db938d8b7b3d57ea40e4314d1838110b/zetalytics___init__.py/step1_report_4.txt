{
  "purpose": "The code imports the Zetalytics class from the zetalytics.zetalytics module, likely for use in analyzing data or performing some security-related function.",
  "sources": "Import statement accessing the 'zetalytics.zetalytics' module",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data is being processed or transmitted within this snippet",
  "flows": "No execution flow beyond the import statement; no data flow or processing occurs in this code snippet",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; only an import statement with no further actions. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code solely imports a class from an external module without executing additional logic or data handling. There are no indicators of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The import itself is standard and does not suggest malicious intent. As the code is only a single import statement, it provides insufficient context to evaluate further risks.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a simple import statement with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger project, and based on this fragment alone, it poses minimal threat.",
