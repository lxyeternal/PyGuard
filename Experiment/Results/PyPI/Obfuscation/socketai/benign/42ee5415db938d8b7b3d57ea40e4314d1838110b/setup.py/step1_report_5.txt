  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'zetalytics-api', which reads a README file for the long description and configures package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file, static package metadata strings",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or user input; only package setup configurations",
  "flows": "Read from file -> assign to variable -> pass variables to setup()",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names such as 'nizUgjaabLXpvXEdQuNnVxrZqAwlkQXT' with no clear purpose, which may suggest obfuscation or malicious intent, but appear to be simply placeholders or obfuscated variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools, reads a README.md file, and passes various static strings and variables to setuptools.setup() for packaging. The variable names used are nonsensical or obfuscated, which could be an attempt to hide malicious intent or just an obfuscation tactic. There are no indications of code injection, malicious network activity, or credential theft. The code appears to be a standard setup script with unconventional variable naming.",
  "conclusion": "The script functions as a typical setup.py for a Python package, with obfuscated variable names that could indicate an attempt at hiding malicious code. However, there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in the provided code.",
