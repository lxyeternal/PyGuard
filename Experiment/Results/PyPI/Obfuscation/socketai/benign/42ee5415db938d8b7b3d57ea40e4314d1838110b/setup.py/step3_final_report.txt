  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script that reads README.md and configures package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file into a variable.",
  "sinks": "Uses the variable in setuptools.setup() for the long description.",
  "flows": "Reads file content -> assigns to variable -> passes to setup()",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; one report notes a syntax error (missing comma) which would prevent execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with obfuscated variable names. It reads a README file and calls setuptools.setup() with static metadata. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or external data processing is present. The obfuscation appears superficial, likely stylistic. The syntax error noted in one report would cause runtime failure but is not malicious. All reports correctly assign malware score 0, indicating no malicious code detected. Obfuscation scores vary but are moderate, reflecting variable naming. Overall, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior or supply chain attacks, only superficial obfuscation and a minor syntax issue.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with superficial obfuscation. No evidence of malicious intent or supply chain compromise is present. The syntax error should be corrected for proper execution but does not imply malicious activity.",
