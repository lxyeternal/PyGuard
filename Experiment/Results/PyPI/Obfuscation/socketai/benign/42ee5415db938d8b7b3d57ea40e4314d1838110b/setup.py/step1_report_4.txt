{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package, intended to package and distribute the 'zetalytics-api' library.",
  "sources": "The code reads from 'README.md' file to assign to a variable; no other input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "The content read from 'README.md' is assigned to a variable but not used elsewhere in a malicious context; no data flows to insecure operations.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names such as 'nizUgjaabLXpvXEdQuNnVxrZqAwlkQXT' and 'ibSfMOPHHUDyGvtUUGaWwVauQyVQWpVB' are obfuscated or nonsensical, which is unusual for standard setup scripts. No other suspicious or malicious code behavior is present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a standard package setup, reading the README for the long description. Variable obfuscation is present but does not necessarily indicate malicious intent; it could be a stylistic choice or an attempt to obscure. There are no signs of malicious code such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. All functions appear consistent with normal packaging procedures.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain attack vectors within this script.",
