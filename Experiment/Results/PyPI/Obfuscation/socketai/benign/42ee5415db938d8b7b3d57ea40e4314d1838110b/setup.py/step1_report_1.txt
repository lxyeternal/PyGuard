{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package named 'zetalytics-api', intended to facilitate package distribution via PyPI or similar repositories.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file content to use as long description; no other data inputs observed.",
  "sinks": "Uses setuptools.setup() to define package metadata and configuration; no untrusted data processing or output operations detected.",
  "flows": "Reads README.md content, then passes static parameters to setuptools.setup() for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "The variable 'nizUgjaabLXpvXEdQuNnVxrZqAwlkQXT' is assigned the README content twice, with the second assignment overwriting the first. Variable naming appears obfuscated but is consistent with a benign purpose of storing package description. No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code are evident.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a README.md file, stores its content, and then calls setuptools.setup() with static, predefined package metadata. All variables are used in the setup call; no dynamic code execution or external data manipulation is present. Variable names are obfuscated but do not indicate malicious intent. The package description, author info, and URL appear legitimate. No code injection, data leakage, or suspicious network activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard package setup script with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscated variable names do not correlate with malicious activity; the script performs typical setup procedures.",
