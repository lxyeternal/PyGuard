  "purpose": "Import all contents from the module tracebackturbo, likely to enhance traceback or error reporting.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing from .tracebackturbo",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks present in this snippet",
  "flows": "Not applicable due to the limited scope of the code",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import (from .tracebackturbo import *), which can obscure code behavior and potentially hide malicious code, but on its own, it doesn't indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a relative import of all symbols from the tracebackturbo module. Wildcard imports are generally discouraged due to namespace pollution and difficulty in tracking imported entities. No explicit code execution, data handling, or suspicious activity is present. Without additional context or content of tracebackturbo, no malicious behavior can be inferred. The snippet is minimal and standard in structure, with no evident anomalies or malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with a wildcard import, which is often discouraged but not inherently malicious. There are no signs of malware or security risks in this limited snippet.",
