  "purpose": "Import all functions or classes from the tracebackturbo module within the same package",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the tracebackturbo module from the current package",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling observed in this single line",
  "flows": "No data flow can be determined from this single import statement alone",
  "anomalies": "Using a wildcard import ('*') can be considered poor practice, but it is not inherently malicious; no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets present",
  "analysis": "The code only contains an import statement that brings in all symbols from the tracebackturbo module within the same package. Without additional context or code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. Wildcard imports may obscure code clarity but do not by themselves indicate malicious intent. No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, network activity, or obfuscated code are evident from this line alone.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues. The code appears to be a standard module import, with no suspicious activity or security risks identifiable from this snippet.",
