  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports focus on a single line: `from .tracebackturbo import *`\n- The code is a wildcard import from a local module/package.\n- No additional code or context is provided.\n- The main concern raised is the use of wildcard imports, which can obscure what is imported and potentially hide malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming if issues are present:\n- **Code correctness:** The import statement is syntactically correct.\n- **Malicious code presence:** Cannot determine from this line alone; no evidence of malicious code is provided.\n- **Malicious behavior or anomalies:** No evidence in the code snippet itself.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes in the reports:\n- All reports correctly identify that wildcard imports are discouraged and can hide malicious code.\n- The reasoning is consistent: without inspecting the `tracebackturbo` module, we cannot confirm malicious intent.\n- The reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate given the lack of evidence.\n- The security risk scores vary slightly but are generally low, which aligns with the limited context.\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which is reasonable.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, which is also reasonable.\n- **Risk scores:** Range from 0.1 to 0.3, reflecting cautiousness but acknowledging the lack of concrete evidence.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5; all are cautious but not alarmist.\n- Given the potential for wildcard imports to hide malicious code, a slightly higher risk score could be justified if there was suspicion, but without evidence, keeping it low is appropriate.\n\n### Potential issues:\n- The reports do not challenge the assumption that the module could contain malicious code; they only note the risk of obscurity.\n- No claims are made about specific vulnerabilities or suspicious behaviors beyond the import style.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** Considering the context, a slightly higher risk score (e.g., 0.2-0.3) could be justified due to the use of wildcard import, but current scores are acceptable.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (due to wildcard import obscurity, but no evidence of malicious intent)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are consistent and cautious. The code itself is benign but uses a practice (wildcard import) that warrants further review of the `tracebackturbo` module. No evidence suggests malicious activity, so the current scoring is appropriate.\n\n**Recommendation:** Further inspection of the `tracebackturbo` module is needed to definitively assess security implications.",
