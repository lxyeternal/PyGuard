  "purpose": "Import all components from the tracebackturbo module.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads data from the tracebackturbo module, which could contain any code, functions, or data.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, any functions or code within tracebackturbo could be invoked or executed, leading to possible malicious behavior if the module contains harmful code.",
  "flows": "Import statement loads and executes code from tracebackturbo, which may contain executable code leading to sinks if functions are called later.",
  "anomalies": "The import uses a wildcard import ('*'), which is generally discouraged due to lack of explicitness and can hide malicious code or obscure the actual imported components. No other code present that explicitly reveals malicious intent, but wildcard imports can be suspicious in security reviews.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single import statement using a wildcard from a local package module. Wildcard imports can hide malicious code or unintended behaviors. Since no further code is present, the analysis is limited to the potential risks associated with such import statements. There is no evidence of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code in this fragment itself, but the wildcard import warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple import operation with a wildcard, which can hide malicious or unintended behavior within the imported module. On its own, the snippet is not malicious, but the use of wildcard import warrants attention, especially in supply chain security contexts.",
