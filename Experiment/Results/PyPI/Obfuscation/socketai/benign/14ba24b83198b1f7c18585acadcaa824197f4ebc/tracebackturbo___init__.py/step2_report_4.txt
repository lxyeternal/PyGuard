  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the reported issues with the original code, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n**Original Code:**\n```python\nfrom .tracebackturbo import *\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Import all components from tracebackturbo.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies that wildcard import can hide malicious code or unintended behavior.\n- **Findings:** No evidence of malicious code, but wildcard import warrants caution.\n- **Scores:** \n  - Confidence: 0.6 (moderately confident)\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0.3 (some concern due to wildcard import)\n  \n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is sound; the import itself isn't malicious but could hide malicious code if present in the module. The scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Import all functions/classes from tracebackturbo.\n- **Analysis:** Same as above, emphasizes that wildcard import can be suspicious but no malicious behavior confirmed.\n- **Scores:** \n  - Confidence: 0.5\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the reasoning is appropriate. The risk scores are consistent with the analysis. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Import all functions/classes from tracebackturbo within the same package.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes that wildcard import is poor practice but not inherently malicious.\n- **Scores:** \n  - Confidence: 0.3\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe low confidence and zero risk scores are justified. The report is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Import all from `.tracebackturbo` (relative import).\n- **Analysis:** Recognizes that wildcard import can obscure behavior but no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Scores:** \n  - Confidence: 0.7\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nHigh confidence, but no evidence of malware. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Import all from local 'tracebackturbo'.\n- **Analysis:** Similar to above, notes that wildcard import can conceal malicious code but no direct evidence.\n- **Scores:** \n  - Confidence: 0.4\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nReasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary & Recommendations:**\n\n- **Code presence of malicious code?**  \n  No. The code is just an import statement; no embedded or executed malicious code is visible.\n\n- **Obfuscation?**  \n  No, the code is straightforward.\n\n- **Malware risk?**  \n  Zero across all reports, which aligns with the code snippet.\n\n- **Scores consistency:**  \n  All reports' scores are consistent with their reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Assessment:**\n\nGiven the minimal nature of the code and the fact that no malicious or obfuscated code is evident, I would assign the following scores:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no evidence of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk:** **0.1** (low, mainly due to wildcard import, which is a best practice concern but not a security breach)\n- **Potential for malicious behavior:** None apparent from this snippet.\n\n**Note:** Wildcard imports are discouraged because they can hide imported symbols, potentially leading to security issues if the imported module is malicious or compromised. However, in this isolated context, there's no evidence supporting malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type        | Final Estimate |\n|-------------------|----------------|\n| Malware           | 0              |\n| Obfuscated        | 0              |\n| Security Risk     | 0.1            |\n\nThe existing reports' assessments are reasonable, and their scores are appropriate given the limited code context. The main concern remains the use of wildcard import, which should be replaced with explicit imports for clarity and security, but this does not constitute malware or obfuscation by itself.",
