  "purpose": "Import all functions or classes from the tracebackturbo module",
  "sources": "The import statement loads the tracebackturbo module or package",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data flows are evident in this single import statement",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as there are no data flows in this single line of code",
  "anomalies": "Use of a wildcard import (*) can be a sign of obfuscation or poor practice, potentially hiding malicious or unnecessary code",
  "analysis": "The code is a single import statement importing everything from the tracebackturbo module. Wildcard imports can make it difficult to determine what is being imported and may hide malicious code or unwanted behavior. Without additional context or code, it is impossible to assess if tracebackturbo contains malicious code. The code itself does not perform any malicious actions but the use of wildcard import warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code uses a wildcard import which can be suspicious, but no malicious behavior can be confirmed from this single line. Further inspection of the tracebackturbo module is necessary to determine if it contains malicious code.",
