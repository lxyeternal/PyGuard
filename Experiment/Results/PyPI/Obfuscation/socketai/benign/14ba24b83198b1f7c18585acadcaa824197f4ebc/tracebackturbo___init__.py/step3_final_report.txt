{
  "purpose": "The code performs a relative wildcard import from the 'tracebackturbo' module, likely to access its functions or classes.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; potential data or symbols imported from 'tracebackturbo'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, if 'tracebackturbo' contains malicious code, it could execute upon import, leading to code execution or malicious behavior.",
  "flows": "Importing the module (source) leads to execution of its top-level code (sink), which could be malicious if the module is compromised.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('*') obscures which symbols are imported, potentially hiding malicious functions or code. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple relative wildcard import, which is generally discouraged due to obscurity and potential security risks. No malicious code or obfuscation is visible in this snippet. The risk depends on the trustworthiness of 'tracebackturbo'. If untrusted, the import could execute malicious code. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with this assessment, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a low to moderate security risk due to the import style. Confidence is moderate to high that the code itself is benign but cautious due to the import method.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign in isolation but employs a wildcard import, which can hide malicious code if the imported module is compromised. No evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation is present. The security risk is low but warrants caution if the source of 'tracebackturbo' is untrusted.",
