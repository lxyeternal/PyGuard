{
  "purpose": "Defines a Python enumeration class with two members using obfuscated names, likely serving as symbolic constants or for concealment.",
  "sources": "The enum class and its members, imported from the enum module, with no external data input or output.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any I/O operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is static and does not handle external input.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and member names, which could be an attempt at concealment or auto-generation; no malicious code or hidden payloads present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static enum class with two members assigned via auto(). Names are nonsensical and obfuscated, but there are no signs of malicious activity, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation is noted but does not imply malicious intent. The code is syntactically correct, benign, and does not perform any operations that could pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated enum definition with no malicious behavior or security concerns. The obfuscation appears intentional or auto-generated but does not indicate malicious intent. The overall security risk is minimal, and the malware score remains at 0.",
