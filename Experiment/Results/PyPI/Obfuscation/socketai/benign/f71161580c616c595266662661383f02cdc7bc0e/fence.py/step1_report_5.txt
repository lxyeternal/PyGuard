  "purpose": "Define a Python enumeration with unique values, likely for internal use or symbolic constants.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are read; only the enum class definition.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points; no data leaks or external communication present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is purely declarative.",
  "anomalies": "The class name and enum member names appear obfuscated, with non-meaningful, random-looking identifiers. No secrets, credentials, or malicious code are evident. The code uses standard enum features and does not perform any suspicious operations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Enum, auto, and unique from the enum module, then defines a uniquely named Enum class decorated with @unique to prevent duplicate values. The class contains two members with automatically assigned values. The obfuscated class and member names suggest either code obfuscation or a generated code artifact. There are no apparent malicious behaviors such as network calls, file operations, or hidden logic. The structure and features are typical for defining symbolic constants.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward enumeration definition with obfuscated names, likely for internal or symbolic purposes. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It appears to be benign and intentionally obfuscated naming may be for code protection or random generation.",
