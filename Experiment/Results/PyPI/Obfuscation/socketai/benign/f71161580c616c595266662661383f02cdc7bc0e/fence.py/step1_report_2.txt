{
  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration class with two members using Python's enum module.",
  "sources": "No input sources; code is static and does not read external data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing, I/O, or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from input to output; static code with only class definition.",
  "anomalies": "Class name and member names are nonsensical and appear obfuscated; no meaningful logic or data handling present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports enum modules and defines an enum class with two members, both using auto() for automatic value assignment. The class name and member names are random or obfuscated, which could be intentional to hide purpose. There are no input/output operations, network calls, or other suspicious behaviors. The code is minimal and appears to be a part of a larger, possibly obfuscated codebase. No signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior are present in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a simple enum class definition with obfuscated names, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears benign and typical of code that may be intentionally obfuscated for concealment, but no malicious intent is detectable.",
