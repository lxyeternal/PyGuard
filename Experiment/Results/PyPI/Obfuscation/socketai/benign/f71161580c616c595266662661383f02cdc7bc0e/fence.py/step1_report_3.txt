  "purpose": "Define a Python enumeration with two members using the enum module.",
  "sources": "Import of enum module; class declaration with auto() for enum members.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data handling or external output present.",
  "flows": "N/A; enumeration is static and does not process untrusted data or perform data flow operations.",
  "anomalies": "Class name and member names are obfuscated or nonsensical, which may be suspicious. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the enum module and defines a unique enumeration with two members. The class name and member names appear intentionally obfuscated or meaningless, which can be suspicious as it might hide malicious intent or be used for obfuscation. However, the code itself is straightforward, with no runtime behavior, data processing, or network activity. The use of @unique and auto() indicates proper enum definition but does not inherently indicate maliciousness. Overall, the code appears as a static, harmless enumeration, albeit with obfuscated identifiers.",
  "conclusion": "The code defines an enumeration with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks based solely on this snippet. The obfuscation may suggest an attempt to hide purpose, but no malicious activity is evident.",
