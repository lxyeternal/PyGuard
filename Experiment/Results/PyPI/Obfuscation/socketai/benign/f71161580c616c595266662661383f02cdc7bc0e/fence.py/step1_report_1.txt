  "purpose": "Define a Python enumeration with two members using the enum module.",
  "sources": "Import of enum module; class declaration and enum member definitions.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "None applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a highly obfuscated class and member names that appear intentionally nonsensical; no other suspicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the enum module and defines a unique enumeration class with two members. The class and members use randomly generated, nonsensical names, which can be an obfuscation technique or intentional confusion. There are no inputs, data processing, or outputs. The code does not include any malicious functions, network activity, or sensitive operations. The obfuscation could be a sign of malicious intent, but in this context, it may also be simply obfuscated or auto-generated code without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple enumeration class with obfuscated names, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The unusual naming could be an attempt at obfuscation but does not indicate malicious activity.",
