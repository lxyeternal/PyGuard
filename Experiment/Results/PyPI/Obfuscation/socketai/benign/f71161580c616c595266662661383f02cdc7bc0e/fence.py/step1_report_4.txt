  "purpose": "Defines a Python enumeration class with unique members using the Enum module.",
  "sources": "Import statement for enum module, class definition, and auto() calls for enum members.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data handling or untrusted data flow observed.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; enumeration values are statically assigned.",
  "anomalies": "Class and member names are nonsensical and obfuscated; no meaningful identifiers or logic; no secrets, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Enum module and defines a class with the @unique decorator. The class members are assigned automatically via auto(). The identifiers used are random strings, which could be an obfuscation technique. There are no data inputs, network operations, or suspicious behaviors. The structure is straightforward and typical for enum definitions, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, obfuscated enumeration class with no malicious behavior or security issues detected. The random naming suggests possible obfuscation, but no harmful logic or vulnerabilities are present.",
