  "conclusion": "The code is obfuscated but lacks evidence of malicious activity or security threats. The high obfuscation scores are justified, but malware scores should remain at 0 or very low, as no malicious actions are observed. Overall, the code appears benign, with obfuscation being the main concern. The current scores are appropriate, but further context from the larger package could be necessary for comprehensive assessment."
