{
  "purpose": "Define a subclass with properties returning specific regex patterns and a boolean value, possibly for pattern matching or configuration.",
  "sources": "Import statement from an external module; class properties that return hardcoded strings and a boolean.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted input or cause side effects.",
  "flows": "No input flow from external sources; properties return static data, no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual class name and property names that appear obfuscated or auto-generated; no clear purpose; only static regex patterns and a boolean.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a potentially obfuscated class and defines a subclass with three properties: one returning a regex string '^```$', another returning True, and a third returning a regex string '^```(.*)$'. These patterns seem designed for matching code blocks or similar constructs, possibly for text processing. The static nature and lack of input handling suggest no malicious activity. No dangerous or suspicious code constructs are present. The code appears to serve as a configuration or pattern matching component. The obfuscated names may indicate an attempt to hide intent, but with only static properties, no malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to define static pattern-matching properties within a class, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscated naming may be a form of code concealment but does not inherently imply malicious intent.",
