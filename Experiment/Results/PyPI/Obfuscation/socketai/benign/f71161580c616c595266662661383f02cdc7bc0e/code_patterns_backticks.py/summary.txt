  "conclusion": "The code shows no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. The obfuscation is likely a concealment tactic rather than an indicator of malicious intent. Scores are consistent with the static, pattern-based nature of the code. It can be considered safe, with low security risk and no malware present."
