{
  "purpose": "Defines a class with properties returning regex patterns and a boolean, likely for pattern matching or configuration purposes.",
  "sources": "The class properties return static strings and a boolean; no external input or data sources are read.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data flows are present; the code does not process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code is static and does not perform data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names, obscure import path, static regex-like strings that could be used for pattern matching or parsing.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an obfuscated class inheriting from an imported base. It contains three properties: two returning static regex-like strings, and one returning a boolean True. No external data, network activity, or dynamic behavior is present. The patterns suggest use in pattern matching, possibly for markdown or code block detection. The obfuscation may be an attempt to conceal purpose but does not indicate malicious intent. The code is static, with no side effects or data leaks. The import path appears misspelled or intentionally obfuscated, but this alone is not suspicious. Overall, the code appears benign, serving as a configuration or pattern matching utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. The obfuscation is likely a concealment tactic rather than an indicator of malicious intent. Scores are consistent with the static, pattern-based nature of the code. It can be considered safe, with low security risk and no malware present.",
