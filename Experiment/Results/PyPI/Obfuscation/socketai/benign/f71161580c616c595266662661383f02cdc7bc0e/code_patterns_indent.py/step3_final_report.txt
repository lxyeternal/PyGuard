{
  "purpose": "Defines a class with regex pattern properties and a boolean flag, likely serving as configuration or validation patterns.",
  "sources": "Class property methods returning static regex strings and a boolean, no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static property returns without dynamic data.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names, misspelled import path 'comprehemd', all static returns, no active behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is obfuscated but consists solely of static regex pattern definitions and a boolean flag. There is no data processing, external I/O, or malicious activity such as code execution or data exfiltration. The obfuscation appears superficial, possibly for internal concealment, but does not indicate malicious intent. The import misspelling 'comprehemd' could be a typo or obfuscation tactic. All indicators point to benign configuration or pattern matching utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is obfuscated configuration code with no malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware and security risk scores should remain at zero or very low. The overall assessment indicates no active threat or malicious intent.",
