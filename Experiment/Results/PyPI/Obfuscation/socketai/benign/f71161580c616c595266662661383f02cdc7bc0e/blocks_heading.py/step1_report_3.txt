  "purpose": "Define a subclass that extends an imported class, adding custom representation and property methods.",
  "sources": "Input parameters in __init__ method, potentially external source via self.nCChdSmxxzSDPWBgPgbTTMVdDODvoIXb in __repr__ and __str__ methods.",
  "sinks": "String representation methods (__repr__ and __str__) that output class information, but no evident data leakage or external communication.",
  "flows": "Initialization with input parameters, usage of internal attributes, no external data flow or untrusted input processing beyond parameter passing.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual class and variable names, which are obfuscated or nonsensical; no obvious malicious code, backdoors, or hardcoded secrets. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass that extends a complex class imported from a module with an obfuscated name. The __init__ method stores a level as an internal attribute, and the __repr__ and __str__ methods output class info. The property provides access to the level attribute. There are no code injection points, no data leaks, no suspicious network or filesystem activity, and no cryptographic or credential handling. The class appears to serve as a data container or model with obfuscated naming, but no malicious intent is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign class definition with heavily obfuscated names. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks based on static analysis. The obfuscation may hinder understanding but does not imply malicious intent.",
