  "conclusion": "The code appears intentionally obfuscated but does not demonstrate malicious behavior or active security vulnerabilities. The undefined attribute in __repr__ warrants caution but is not sufficient alone to elevate the risk. The scores from the reports are consistent and appropriate given the static analysis; further dynamic review could clarify external influences."
