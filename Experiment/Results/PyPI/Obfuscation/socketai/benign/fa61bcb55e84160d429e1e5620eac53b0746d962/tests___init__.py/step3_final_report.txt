  "purpose": "Assessment of supply chain security and malicious behavior in Python package code.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, network/file operations, dynamic code execution, obfuscated code segments.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, dynamic eval/exec calls.",
  "flows": "Input sources (env vars, network) to sinks (network/file operations, eval/exec).",
  "anomalies": "Signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, suspicious network activity, minimal or no code context.",
  "analysis": "Most reports correctly identify the presence or absence of malicious indicators, with scores generally aligned to evidence. Report 4 shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, suggesting higher suspicion; its malware score should be increased from 0.2 to 0.3 to better reflect potential risk. Other reports are consistent and reasonable in their scoring and reasoning.",
  "conclusion": "Overall, the reports are accurate, with the main adjustment needed in Report 4's malware score to account for signs of obfuscation and dynamic features. This adjustment ensures the scoring reflects the potential for malicious behavior more appropriately.",
