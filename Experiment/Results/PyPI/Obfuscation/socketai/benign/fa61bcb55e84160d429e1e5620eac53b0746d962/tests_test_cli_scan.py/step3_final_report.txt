  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Dynamic code execution points, hardcoded strings, environment variables, input functions.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file system, environment variables, potential data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as eval/exec or input functions flow into code execution or data handling sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic code execution, obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, suspicious strings, complex constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits varying levels of obfuscation and dynamic execution. Benign code shows no suspicious patterns, with scores reflecting low threat. Suspicious code contains eval/exec, obfuscation, and hardcoded secrets, justifying higher malware and obfuscation scores. The assessments are consistent with the behaviors described, with high confidence in benign cases and moderate to high confidence in suspicious ones.",
  "conclusion": "Most reports are consistent with their scores; benign code is correctly scored low, while suspicious code with dynamic execution and obfuscation has appropriately higher scores. Slightly increasing malware score in the most suspicious report (report 5) from 0.3 to 0.4 could better reflect the suspicion, but current scores are acceptable. Overall, the scoring aligns well with the analysis, indicating no major revisions needed.",
