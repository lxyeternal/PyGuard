  "conclusion": "Most reports are consistent with their scores; benign code is correctly scored low, while suspicious code with dynamic execution and obfuscation has appropriately higher scores. Slightly increasing malware score in the most suspicious report (report 5) from 0.3 to 0.4 could better reflect the suspicion, but current scores are acceptable. Overall, the scoring aligns well with the analysis, indicating no major revisions needed."
