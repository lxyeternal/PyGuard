{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package named 'zqy4c6jqndiw8uef' that includes rules for the 'yara' security tool, manages platform-specific library loading, and registers console scripts.",
  "sources": "File reading in 'yara/version.py', os.walk for directory traversal, platform and environment data, environment variables, and package setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "File operations, platform and environment info, package data handling, setup configuration, and print statements.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from 'yara/version.py' -> uses platform info to determine library paths -> loads libraries conditionally based on OS -> registers setup info including package data and scripts.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated-like variable names, intentionally confusing lambda override for 'atexit.register', and dynamic path construction. The code does not contain clear malicious behavior but includes obfuscation techniques and hardcoded package info.",
  "analysis": "The code is a package setup script with obfuscated variable names and some unconventional constructs, such as overriding 'atexit.register' with a lambda that does nothing. It reads version info from a file, searches for rule files in a 'rules' directory, and dynamically constructs library paths based on OS and architecture. It loads platform-specific shared libraries (.dll or .so). The code does not perform network operations, system modification, or data exfiltration. However, the obfuscation and hardcoded strings could be used to hide malicious intent, but no explicit malicious actions are evident. The code is mainly for packaging and platform-specific library handling.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate setup process for a Python package involving YARA rules and libraries, with some obfuscation. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data leaks are detected. The obfuscation could be an attempt to hide complexity, but there is no clear malicious intent. Overall security risk is low.",
