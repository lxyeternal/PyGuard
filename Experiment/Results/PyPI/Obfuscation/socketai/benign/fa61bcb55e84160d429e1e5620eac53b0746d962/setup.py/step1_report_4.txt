{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package named 'zqy4c6jqndiw8uef' with specific package data, dependencies, and entry points, likely related to yara rules and native libraries.",
  "sources": "File reading of 'yara/version.py', environment information via platform module, and os.path functions for file path handling.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks of untrusted data are evident; setup parameters and file paths are constructed from static and environment-derived values.",
  "flows": "File content is read from 'yara/version.py' to extract version; file paths are assembled based on environment info and checked for existence; package data is assigned accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable and function names; a lambda overriding 'atexit.register' with a no-op; dynamic assembly of paths and conditional library linking based on platform; potential placeholder or dummy code with minimal functionality.",
  "analysis": "The code performs package setup operations, including reading version info from a file, gathering platform info, constructing paths for native libraries, and configuring package metadata. The obfuscated naming and dummy lambda for 'atexit.register' suggest an attempt to mask intent or reduce clarity. No evidence of data leakage, code injection, or malicious network activity is present. The code appears to be standard setup logic with some obfuscation, likely to hinder straightforward analysis but not inherently malicious. No suspicious data flows, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard package setup with deliberate obfuscation in variable names and minimalistic logic. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware signatures are evident. It primarily manages package configuration and native library inclusion based on environment, with no indication of security risks or malicious intent.",
