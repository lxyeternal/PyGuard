  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate security utility with a significant input handling vulnerability due to unsafe eval() usage. There is no active malicious behavior detected. The obfuscation level is moderate, and the overall security risk is primarily from potential code injection via eval(). The malware score should be set to 0, but the security risk score should be increased to reflect the eval() vulnerability."
