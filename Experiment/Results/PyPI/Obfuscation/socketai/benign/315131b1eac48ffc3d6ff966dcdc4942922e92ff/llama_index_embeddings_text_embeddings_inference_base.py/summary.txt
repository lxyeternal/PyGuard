  "conclusion": "The code is primarily a standard API client with configurable parameters. However, the use of a localhost URL and an undefined 'auth_token' introduces moderate security concerns, especially if the local server is malicious or the token is mishandled. These elements warrant further review before deployment, as they could be exploited for credential theft or local backdoor access."
