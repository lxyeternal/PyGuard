  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate test suite for telemetry instrumentation with no evidence of malware or sabotage. The embedding of trace context into SQL comments is standard practice, and obfuscation is typical for test or generated code. The supply chain security risk is minimal, with the main consideration being the exposure of trace IDs if logs are insecure, which is a known trade-off in distributed tracing."
