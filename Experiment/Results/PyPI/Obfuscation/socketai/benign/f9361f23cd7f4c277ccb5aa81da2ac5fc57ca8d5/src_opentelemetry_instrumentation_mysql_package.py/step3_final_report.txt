  "purpose": "Dependency declaration for mysql-connector-python with version constraints",
  "sources": "Assignment of dependency string to an obfuscated variable name",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or security effects",
  "flows": "N/A; simple variable assignment without data flow or external interactions",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable name; no other unusual code or behavior",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a standard dependency string to an obfuscated variable. No malicious logic, input handling, network activity, or code execution is present. The obfuscated variable name is unusual but does not imply malicious intent. The code is syntactically correct and benign. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, risk=0.1, obfuscated=0.3) are consistent with the benign nature. The obfuscation may be superficial or auto-generated, but it does not constitute malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign dependency declaration with an obfuscated variable name. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. The current scores are appropriate; no further action is necessary.",
