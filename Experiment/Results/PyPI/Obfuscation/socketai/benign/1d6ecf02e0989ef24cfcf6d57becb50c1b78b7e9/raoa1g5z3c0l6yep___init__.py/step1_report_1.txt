{
  "purpose": "Import a specific function from a local module within the package, likely for testing or internal use.",
  "sources": "Assignment of a version string, import statement importing 'lbwknvARgdKJnGHwhbUmafgzwDYTNXHI' from a local module.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any untrusted data sinks or operations that handle untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the import is static and safe.",
  "anomalies": "The variable name 'hNFlVZeTmuLWWAUVCABXLkSdYeuSurOY' is a nonsensical string, possibly obfuscated, but only assigned a version string; no other suspicious activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to a variable with a seemingly random name, then imports a function from a local module. No user input, network activity, or execution of untrusted code is present. The import statement is standard and does not pose a security risk. The unusual variable name could be a form of obfuscation, but in isolation, it does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, consisting of a version assignment and a local import. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
