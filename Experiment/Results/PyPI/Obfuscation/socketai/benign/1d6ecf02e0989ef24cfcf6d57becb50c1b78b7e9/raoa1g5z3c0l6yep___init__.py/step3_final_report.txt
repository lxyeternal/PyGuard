{
  "purpose": "Minimal code with version string assignment and local import, primarily obfuscated variable and module names.",
  "sources": "Assignment to variable 'hNFlVZeTmuLWWAUVCABXLkSdYeuSurOY'; import statement from local module '.pytest_pyvista'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, network activity, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only assigns a string and imports a module.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and module names; no additional code or logic; minimal structure.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a version string assigned to an obfuscated variable and an import from a local module with an obfuscated name. No evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or active malicious code. Obfuscation raises suspicion but is not conclusive. The import is from a local module, which is common in package code, but the nonsensical naming could be used to hide malicious intent. The code does not perform any network activity, data processing, or execute untrusted code. The minimal structure and obfuscation warrant further review of the imported module contents, but based solely on this snippet, the risk is low.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with obfuscation as the main concern. No active malicious behavior is detected. The low malware score is appropriate; obfuscation score is moderate to high due to naming patterns. Further inspection of the imported module is recommended to confirm safety.",
