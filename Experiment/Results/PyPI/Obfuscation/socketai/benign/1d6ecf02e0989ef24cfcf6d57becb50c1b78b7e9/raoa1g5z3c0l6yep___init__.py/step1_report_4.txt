{
  "purpose": "Define a version string and import a specific function from a local module named 'pytest_pyvista'.",
  "sources": "The version string assignment and the import statement from .pytest_pyvista",
  "sinks": "The import statement potentially loads external or local code; the version string is a data holder with no active effect",
  "flows": "The version string is set but not used; the import may lead to execution of code within pytest_pyvista, which could be malicious if the module contains malicious code",
  "anomalies": "The variable name for the version string appears obfuscated or nonsensical; no clear purpose or standard naming convention; the imported function has a seemingly random name, which may indicate obfuscation or malicious intent",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version string with an obscure variable name, which itself does not pose a security threat but suggests obfuscation. The import statement from a relative module 'pytest_pyvista' imports a function with an unusual name. Without inspecting 'pytest_pyvista', it is impossible to determine if the imported function is malicious. The code does not perform any actions beyond defining a string and importing a function, but the nonsensical naming and import pattern could be an attempt to hide malicious behavior. No explicit malicious code or suspicious behavior is evident in this fragment, but the obfuscation warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal and appears obfuscated through variable and function naming. It imports a potentially malicious or obfuscated module/function. Without further context, there's a moderate risk that this could be part of a malicious or obfuscated package, but the snippet alone does not confirm malicious intent.",
