  "confidence": 0.8,
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with obfuscation as the main concern. No active malicious behavior is detected. The low malware score is appropriate; obfuscation score is moderate to high due to naming patterns. Further inspection of the imported module is recommended to confirm safety."
