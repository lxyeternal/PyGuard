{
  "purpose": "Import a specific function from a local module within a package, possibly related to testing or plotting (based on module name 'pytest_pyvista').",
  "sources": "Assignment of a string to an obfuscated variable; import statement importing a potentially obfuscated function from a relative module.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data flows into sensitive functions or operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only assigns a string and performs an import.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a non-descriptive, seemingly obfuscated variable name; import of a function with an obfuscated name; no clear purpose or documentation. The variable assignment appears unnecessary unless used elsewhere.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to an obscure variable name, then imports a function with an obfuscated name from a sibling module. There are no data processing, network calls, or suspicious operations present. The import and assignment are benign on their own but could be part of a larger obfuscated code base. The naming pattern and lack of context raise minor suspicion but are not definitive of malicious intent. Overall, the code snippet is minimal and does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks in isolation.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be part of an obfuscated or poorly documented module, but there is no evident malicious behavior or security threat. The operations are benign and typical of package code, with no signs of malicious activity.",
