      "conclusion": "The snippet shows obfuscated identifiers and incomplete export declarations but no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware and risk scores should remain low. The code appears benign; further context is needed for definitive assessment, but current evidence indicates no malicious intent."

      "conclusion": "The code functions as an obfuscated, deprecated wrapper around an internal authentication library. No direct signs of malicious activity are present within this snippet. The primary concern is the trustworthiness of the external 'self.lib'. The obfuscation justifies a high obfuscated score, but the malware score remains low. Overall, the code appears benign but warrants further review of the external library to ensure security."

      "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a typical FastAPI security component with obfuscated identifiers. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or sabotage. The high obfuscation level warrants caution but does not justify a malware classification. The external validation method remains a trust point, but based on available information, the code is safe. Scores are consistent with the analysis: malware score 0, obfuscation high (around 0.7), and low security risk (around 0.3)."

The obfuscation is likely stylistic or for concealment, not malicious. The assigned scores are appropriate, with malware at 0, obfuscation around 0.7, and low risk (~0.1-0.2). The code poses minimal security concern within a testing context."
