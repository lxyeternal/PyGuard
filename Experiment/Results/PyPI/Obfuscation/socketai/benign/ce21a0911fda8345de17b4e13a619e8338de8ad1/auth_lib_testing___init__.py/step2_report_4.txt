  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code attempts to import two functions from 'auth_lib.testing.testutils'.\n- If the import fails, it prints instructions to install testing requirements and re-raises the ImportError.\n- The variable and function names appear random or obfuscated, but there's no malicious behavior or obfuscation beyond naming.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Import testing utilities or prompt installation.\n- **Analysis:** Straightforward import with error handling; no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscation:** Slightly obfuscated names but benign.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — correct.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — high, given the simplicity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.2 — reasonable, minor obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign dependency import.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's reasoning aligns with the code. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, handling import failure.\n- **Analysis:** Similar reasoning; standard dependency management.\n- **Obfuscation:** Slightly higher at 0.7, which is reasonable given the variable names.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal, as the code is benign.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.2 — slightly lower than report 1, but still acceptable.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity detected.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate assessment; no issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** Similar; emphasizes obfuscated identifiers but no malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscation:** High at 0.7, consistent with the code.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — low, as the code is benign.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8 — reasonable.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.7 — high, reflecting the obfuscated names.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** Well justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** Recognizes obfuscated function names but finds no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscation:** 0.8 — consistent.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — correct.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.8 — aligns with the code.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Same pattern.\n- **Analysis:** Notes obfuscated identifiers, no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscation:** 0.4 — moderate, reasonable.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — correct.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8 — justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.4 — reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, correctly reflecting no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** Slightly high but justified given the variable names.\n- **Risk scores:** All minimal, appropriate for dependency import code.\n\n**Potential improvements:**\n- The obfuscated scores could be slightly lowered if we consider the names as benign, but given the context, their high obfuscation justifies the current scores.\n- The confidence levels are high across reports, which is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Systematic Estimate:**\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** Around 0.3 to 0.4 — the code uses obfuscated-looking names but no malicious intent.\n\n**Risk score:** 0.05 to 0.1 — very low, as this is a dependency import pattern.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The reports are consistent with the code.\n- No signs of malware or malicious activity.\n- Obfuscation is likely benign, possibly for code protection or stylistic reasons.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and justified.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The overall security risk of this code snippet is negligible. The reports' assessments are accurate and thorough.",
