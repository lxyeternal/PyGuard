  "purpose": "Import testing utilities from the auth_lib package, or prompt installation if missing.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing specific functions from 'auth_lib.testing.testutils'.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data or untrusted input handling or data leakage points.",
  "flows": "Import attempt from external package; error handling prints message and re-raises exception.",
  "anomalies": "Use of seemingly random function and variable names which could suggest obfuscation, but no actual malicious behavior or obfuscation is evident. The code does not perform any suspicious actions beyond import handling.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import two functions from a testing module within 'auth_lib'. If the import fails, it prompts the user to install the testing requirements and re-raises the ImportError. The variable and function names appear random, which could be a simple obfuscation tactic, but there's no indication of malicious intent. The code is straightforward, primarily managing dependency import and error messaging, with no malicious or malicious-sounding operations. No data flow or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a simple dependency import with error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscated-like naming is likely intentional but benign, aimed possibly at code clarity or obscurity. Overall, this is a benign dependency import pattern with no security issues.",
