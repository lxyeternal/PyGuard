  "purpose": "Dependency import with error handling prompting installation of testing requirements.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'auth_lib.testing.testutils' and the exception handling block.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows or external effects.",
  "flows": "Import attempt → exception handling (print and re-raise) — no malicious or suspicious data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated or non-descriptive function/variable names; no malicious code or obfuscation tactics beyond naming.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import two functions from a testing utility module, with error handling prompting the user to install missing dependencies. The variable and function names are obfuscated but do not indicate malicious intent. The code does not perform any network activity, data processing, or malicious actions. The exception handling is straightforward, with print statements and re-raising the error. The obfuscated names raise suspicion but are not evidence of malicious behavior. The malware score is correctly 0, and the security risk is minimal (~0.1), consistent across all reports. The obfuscation score varies depending on the perceived obscurity of the names but remains moderate, justified by the cryptic identifiers.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign dependency import pattern with obfuscated identifiers that do not suggest malicious intent. No malicious activity, data leakage, or sabotage is evident. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
