  "purpose": "Attempting to import specific testing utility functions from an external library 'auth_lib.testing.testutils'.",
  "sources": "The import statement importing 'sDafKIeIDavMcVUXZtkaOBKtVrTlIWJz' and 'dCmWuzfPDKZBeLJHPylhvsNmxBFnOFWd' from 'auth_lib.testing.testutils'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present that process untrusted data or perform harmful actions.",
  "flows": "N/A - No data flow from source to sink identified in the code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The imported function names are cryptic and randomly generated, which is unusual for legitimate function names. The code has minimal structure and does not perform any actual logic beyond the import attempt. The exception handling only prints instructions for installing testing requirements, which is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import two functions from a testing utility module. If the import fails, it prompts the user to install the testing dependencies. The function names are intentionally obfuscated or randomly generated, which could indicate an attempt to hide malicious intent or simply be a placeholder. There is no evidence of data leakage, malicious behavior, or malicious code execution. The import and error handling are typical for optional testing dependencies. No suspicious code patterns, such as network activity, code execution, or credential handling, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import fallback pattern for testing utilities with obfuscated function names. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected. The obfuscated function names alone do not indicate malicious intent, and the overall structure is benign.",
