  "purpose": "Import specific test utilities from the auth_lib.testing.testutils module, or prompt to install testing requirements if not present.",
  "sources": "Import statement: from auth_lib.testing.testutils import ...",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; only exception handling and print statements.",
  "flows": "Import attempt from a potentially external library; if failed, print message and raise ImportError.",
  "anomalies": "Import statement uses obfuscated variable names; no evidence of malicious code, but the variable names may indicate obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import specific functions from a testing utility library. If the import fails, it prints instructions to install the testing requirements and re-raises the error. The import statement includes obfuscated function names, which could be an attempt to hide intent, but they are only used as import targets. The __all__ declaration exposes two identifiers, possibly used elsewhere in the project. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code execution. The only unusual aspect is the obfuscated variable names in the import statement, which is common in some obfuscated or protected code. Overall, the code's intent appears to be related to testing setup, with no malicious activity detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward attempt to import testing utilities with obfuscated identifiers. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The obfuscation might be for code protection or concealment but does not indicate malicious intent.",
