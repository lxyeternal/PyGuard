{
  "purpose": "The code attempts to import specific testing utilities from an external library, handling import errors by prompting the user to install required testing dependencies.",
  "sources": "The import statement from 'auth_lib.testing.testutils' is the primary source of external data input.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs a message to the console using print(), which could potentially leak information if verbose error messages are enabled in a different context, but this is standard behavior.",
  "flows": "If the import fails, the code prints instructions and re-raises the ImportError; otherwise, it completes without further data flow.",
  "anomalies": "The imported identifiers have obfuscated or non-descriptive names, which could be a sign of code obfuscation or simply poorly named variables. The exception variable 'kQLZIuVfxPHOLywIyffUYIJSJEJUkeiB' is unusually long and nonspecific, but this alone is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script's main function is to import testing utilities, and it handles failure gracefully by instructing the user to install missing dependencies. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as code execution, data exfiltration, or backdoors is evident. The use of obfuscated-looking variable names may indicate an attempt to conceal intent, but it is not definitive proof of malicious activity. The print statements are standard for dependency prompts. Overall, the code appears to be a simple dependency loader with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard dependency import with error handling for missing packages. There are no signs of malware or malicious behavior. The unusual variable naming could be suspicious but does not demonstrate malicious intent. Overall security risk is very low.",
