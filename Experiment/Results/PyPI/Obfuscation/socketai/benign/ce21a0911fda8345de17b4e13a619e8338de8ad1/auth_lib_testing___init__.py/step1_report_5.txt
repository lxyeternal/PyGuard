  "purpose": "Attempt to import specific testing utilities from an external library for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "The import statement from 'auth_lib.testing.testutils'.",
  "sinks": "The import itself; no other sinks present in the code.",
  "flows": "Import statement to local variables; no data flow beyond import and print statements.",
  "anomalies": "Use of seemingly random, obfuscated-looking variable names for imported modules. The code does not execute any malicious actions but uses non-descriptive identifiers that could hide malicious intent or simply be obfuscated. The print statements could indicate a potential for guidance or social engineering if maliciously altered.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import two testing utility functions from a package 'auth_lib'. If the import fails, it prompts the user to install a specific testing requirements package. The variable names used in the import are unusual and look obfuscated, but this alone does not imply malicious intent. The code's primary function is to ensure testing dependencies are available, which is common in test setup scripts. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. The obfuscated variable names could be an attempt to hide malicious code or simply a coding style, but based solely on this fragment, there is no evidence of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import with an error handling message guiding the user to install testing dependencies. While the variable names are unusual, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be part of a testing setup, not malicious or sabotage code.",
