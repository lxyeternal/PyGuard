  "purpose": "API middleware for authentication and authorization, validating tokens via external API, checking user scopes.",
  "sources": "Request headers and cookies for Authorization tokens, environment variables or configuration for API URLs, external API call for token validation.",
  "sinks": "External API call for token validation, response handling for authorization status.",
  "flows": "Token extracted from request, validated via external API, scope checked, then request proceeds or is rejected.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with meaningless variable names, unused dummy functions, and dummy string; no malicious code or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a standard auth middleware with obfuscation. No malicious activity such as data exfiltration, command execution, or network connections to suspicious domains is present. Obfuscation and dummy code suggest concealment but not malicious intent. External API dependency is standard but warrants monitoring. Overall, the code is legitimate with moderate obfuscation, and no active vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, if obfuscated, API authorization wrapper with no malware or malicious behavior detected. The security risk is low, and the obfuscation appears to be for concealment rather than malicious purposes.",
