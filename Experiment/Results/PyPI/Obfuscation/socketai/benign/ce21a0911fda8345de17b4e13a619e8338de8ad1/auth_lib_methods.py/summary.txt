  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate API client with high obfuscation but no evidence of malicious behavior. Malware score is 0, obfuscation is high (around 0.7), and security risk is low (0.2). Continuous monitoring is recommended due to obfuscation, but current analysis indicates no malicious activity."
