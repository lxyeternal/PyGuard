{
  "purpose": "API client for login, user info retrieval, logout, and user detail fetch, with obfuscated variable and class names.",
  "sources": "Input parameters (email, password, authorization token, user ID), responses from requests library.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to external endpoints, response handling, exception raising.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., email/password, auth token) sent via requests.post/get to specific URLs; responses processed to return data or raise exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names, complex exception class names, dynamic URL joins, no hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard API client with obfuscated identifiers, performing typical login, user info, logout, and user retrieval operations. No hardcoded secrets, malicious network activity, or data exfiltration is evident. Obfuscation raises suspicion but does not indicate malicious intent. Exception classes are imported but not defined here, limiting full assessment. The network requests use standard patterns, and response handling appears normal. Overall, the code seems legitimate but intentionally obfuscated, which warrants cautious monitoring.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate API client with high obfuscation but no evidence of malicious behavior. Malware score is 0, obfuscation is high (around 0.7), and security risk is low (0.2). Continuous monitoring is recommended due to obfuscation, but current analysis indicates no malicious activity.",
