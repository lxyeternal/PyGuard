{
  "purpose": "This code defines a deprecated class for asynchronous authentication methods, wrapping calls to an underlying library and issuing deprecation warnings.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration data during class instantiation, and takes input parameters in its methods such as email, password, token, and user ID.",
  "sinks": "The methods invoke underlying library functions that likely handle sensitive data such as credentials and tokens; these data could potentially be leaked or misused if the library behaves maliciously.",
  "flows": "Input parameters like email, password, token, and user ID are passed into class methods, which then call corresponding functions in the wrapped library, potentially transmitting or processing sensitive data.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only warnings for deprecation; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious control flows are present. The class wraps another library without revealing its implementation; the library's behavior is unknown. No explicit malicious code or backdoors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily consists of a deprecated wrapper class that forwards calls to an underlying library object, passing user-provided credentials and tokens. It issues deprecation warnings but does not include hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs. The underlying library's functions are unknown, which could potentially be a risk if malicious, but based solely on this code, no malicious behavior is detected. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscated code or unusual logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code acts as a deprecated wrapper around an internal library for authentication purposes. It does not exhibit malicious behavior itself but relies on the behavior of the underlying library, which is unknown. There are no signs of sabotage or malicious intent in this fragment.",
