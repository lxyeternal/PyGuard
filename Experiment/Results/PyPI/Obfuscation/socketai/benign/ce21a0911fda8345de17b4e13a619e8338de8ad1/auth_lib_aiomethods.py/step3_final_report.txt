{
  "purpose": "A deprecated wrapper class around an internal authentication library, heavily obfuscated, delegating core functions to 'self.lib'.",
  "sources": "Input parameters in methods (email, token, user_id), class constructor parameters.",
  "sinks": "Delegated calls to 'self.lib' methods, which may perform network or system operations depending on their implementation.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into delegated 'self.lib' methods; no direct data leaks or system modifications visible.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of class and method names, deprecation warnings indicating legacy code, delegation to an opaque external library.",
  "analysis": "The code is a heavily obfuscated, deprecated wrapper around an internal library, with all core functionalities delegated to 'self.lib'. No explicit malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious control flows are present. The obfuscation and delegation could be used to conceal malicious behavior if 'self.lib' is malicious, but within this snippet, no evidence supports malicious activity. The deprecation warnings suggest legacy code, and the reliance on an external library warrants further inspection of that component. The obfuscation justifies a high obfuscated score, while the malware score remains low due to lack of direct malicious actions. The security risk score is moderate, considering delegation to an external, opaque library.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as an obfuscated, deprecated wrapper around an internal authentication library. No direct signs of malicious activity are present within this snippet. The primary concern is the trustworthiness of the external 'self.lib'. The obfuscation justifies a high obfuscated score, but the malware score remains low. Overall, the code appears benign but warrants further review of the external library to ensure security.",
