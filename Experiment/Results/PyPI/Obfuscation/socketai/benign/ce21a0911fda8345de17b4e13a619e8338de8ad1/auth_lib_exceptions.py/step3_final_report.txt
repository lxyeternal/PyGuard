  "purpose": "Defines a set of obfuscated custom exception classes that accept dictionaries, convert them to strings, and pass them to the base exception class. The base class contains an unused string attribute.",
  "sources": "Input dictionaries provided during exception class instantiation.",
  "sinks": "Conversion of input dictionaries to strings for exception messages; no external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input dictionaries flow into string conversion, then into exception message construction.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and attribute names; unused string attribute in base class; no operational logic or external interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions with obfuscated names, accepting dictionaries and passing their string representations to the superclass. No network, file, or code execution activities are present. The obfuscation appears superficial, likely for concealment, but does not indicate malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, with no suspicious behaviors or vulnerabilities. Scores assigned across reports (malware=0, obfuscated ~0.7-0.8, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's structure and observed obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of obfuscated exception class definitions with no malicious or security-threatening behavior. The obfuscation appears superficial and does not suggest malicious intent or supply chain compromise. The current scores are appropriate and reflect minimal security risk.",
