{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for data processing and possibly for communicating with an external server.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables and external network requests.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to external domains, data output, and possible environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> Data processing functions -> Network request functions -> External server.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials observed; no obfuscated code; no suspicious network activity or hidden backdoors detected; standard data processing and network communication are present.",
  "analysis": "The code reads input from environment variables, processes data, and performs network requests to specific URLs. There is no evidence of malicious code such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors. Usage of standard libraries and straightforward code structure suggest no obfuscation or malware. The code's intent appears benign, although its purpose is mainly data transmission, which should be reviewed in the context of its deployment environment.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not show signs of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. It performs standard data processing and network communication without suspicious or malicious activities. No security risks are evident based on the provided code.",
