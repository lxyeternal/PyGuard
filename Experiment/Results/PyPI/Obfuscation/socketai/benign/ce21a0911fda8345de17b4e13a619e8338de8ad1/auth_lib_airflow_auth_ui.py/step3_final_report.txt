  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks based on provided code snippets or descriptions.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, network requests, data processing functions, system calls, input/output points.",
  "sinks": "Network communication endpoints, environment variables, system commands, data outputs.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or input data flow into processing functions, which may then send data over the network or execute system commands.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code or presence of benign code performing standard operations; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify the absence of code or benign code with no malicious indicators. The reports' scoring aligns with the described behavior: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk scores around 0.2, which are appropriate given the benign nature. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The high confidence scores reflect the clarity of benign behavior. The code described performs standard environment variable reading, data processing, and network requests without evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The provided reports are accurate and consistent with the code descriptions. No malicious activity or obfuscation is detected. The security risk is low, and the scores are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
