{
  "purpose": "The code appears to import a function and define a date string, then specify an exported symbol. Its purpose is likely related to authentication or authorization based on the name 'AuthLib'.",
  "sources": "The code reads an import statement from a local module '.methods' and assigns a string to a variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that handle untrusted data or lead to potential data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "The import flow does not process untrusted data; the string assignment is static and does not involve external input.",
  "anomalies": "The imported function name 'pRvYWIKpliBbJpvJRlKZIJorbEvOtPkt' appears obfuscated or randomly generated, which could be suspicious; the rest of the code is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a possibly obfuscated function from a local module, assigns a fixed date string to a variable, and declares an export. No evidence of malicious behavior or suspicious activity such as network communication, data exfiltration, or credential handling is present. The obfuscated function name may warrant further inspection of the 'methods' module, but on its own, this code fragment is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal, with no evident malicious intent. The obfuscated function name is unusual but not inherently malicious. Overall, the code appears safe, with no security risks identified.",
