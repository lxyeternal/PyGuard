  "purpose": "Minimal code importing an obfuscated function and defining a date string, with an export list referencing 'AuthLib'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from '.methods', assignment of obfuscated date string to variable, '__all__' list referencing 'AuthLib'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data flows present; no network, file, or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Import source to function usage (not shown), variable to potential external use (not present), '__all__' export declaration.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function and variable names, '__all__' referencing 'AuthLib' without definition, minimal code with no context.",
  "analysis": "The code imports an obfuscated function, assigns a date string to a nonsensical variable, and declares an export list referencing 'AuthLib'. No malicious actions such as network calls, data leaks, or code execution are evident. Obfuscation raises suspicion but is not conclusive of malicious intent. The absence of any external effects or malicious patterns suggests benign behavior. The obfuscated identifiers are consistent with obfuscation practices but do not demonstrate malicious activity. The '__all__' list references 'AuthLib' which is undefined here, indicating incomplete code or further obfuscation. Overall, the code is minimal, obfuscated, but lacks evidence of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet shows obfuscated identifiers and incomplete export declarations but no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware and risk scores should remain low. The code appears benign; further context is needed for definitive assessment, but current evidence indicates no malicious intent.",
