{
  "purpose": "The code imports a specific function from a local module and defines a string and an export list for a module named 'AuthLib'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module (.methods), assignment of a string to WMxfkVLHPcGUqDmmZquNqoMSufKdNOwd.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any apparent sinks such as network calls, file writes, or execution of untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the import and the string assignment; however, there are no flows leading to potential vulnerabilities or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "The imported function name 'pRvYWIKpliBbJpvJRlKZIJorbEvOtPkt' appears to be a nonsensical or obfuscated identifier; the variable name WMxfkVLHPcGUqDmmZquNqoMSufKdNOwd is also nonsensical, suggesting potential obfuscation or hidden intent. There are no other suspicious or malicious code patterns present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs minimal actions: importing a function from a relative module and defining a string and an export list. The function name and variable name appear obfuscated, which could be suspicious, but without further context or malicious actions, this is not conclusive. No network, file, or system modifications are present. The code alone does not indicate malicious intent, but the obfuscated names warrant caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and does not contain clear malicious behavior or security risks on its own. The obfuscated identifiers could suggest an attempt to conceal intent, but without additional context, this remains inconclusive.",
