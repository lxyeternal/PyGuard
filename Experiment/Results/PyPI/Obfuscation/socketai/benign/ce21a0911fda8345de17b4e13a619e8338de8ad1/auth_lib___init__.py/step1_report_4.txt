  "purpose": "Import a specific function from a local module and define a module-level variable and export.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a relative module; assignment of a string to a variable.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or external communication.",
  "flows": "Import retrieves code from a local module; variable assignment is internal.",
  "anomalies": "The imported function name appears to be a random string, which could be suspicious; the variable name and value seem benign, but the function name's obfuscation could be intentional or malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function with an obfuscated name from a local module, which might be normal or an attempt to hide malicious intent. The string variable assignment appears harmless. The __all__ declaration exposes only 'AuthLib', which is not defined in this snippet, possibly indicating incomplete or obfuscated code. There are no external data inputs, network connections, or evident malicious operations. The use of a non-descriptive function name could be an obfuscation tactic, but with no further context, it cannot be confirmed as malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal and does not show clear malicious behavior, but the obfuscated function name and lack of context warrant cautious review of the full package. No direct security risks are evident from this snippet alone.",
