  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a typical FastAPI security component with obfuscated identifiers. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or sabotage. The high obfuscation level warrants caution but does not justify a malware classification. The external validation method remains a trust point, but based on available information, the code is safe. Scores are consistent with the analysis: malware score 0, obfuscation high (around 0.7), and low security risk (around 0.3)."
