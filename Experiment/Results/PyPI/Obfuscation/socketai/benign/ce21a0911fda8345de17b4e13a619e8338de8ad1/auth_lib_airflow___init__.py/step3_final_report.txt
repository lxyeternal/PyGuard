    "justification": "The scores are adjusted to reflect the detailed analysis: benign reports (1, 2, 4, 5) are assigned minimal or zero malware and obfuscation scores with low security risk, consistent with their descriptions. Report 3's high suspicion indicators justify its elevated malware (0.75), obfuscation (0.9), and security risk (0.8) scores. These adjustments ensure internal consistency and alignment with the evidence-based reasoning."
