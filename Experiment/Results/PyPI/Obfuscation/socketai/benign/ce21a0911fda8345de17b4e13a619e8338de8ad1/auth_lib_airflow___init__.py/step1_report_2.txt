{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script that performs data processing and possibly interacts with external resources or user input, but specific intent cannot be determined without the code content.",
  "sources": "Input from environment variables, user input, file reads, network responses, or external APIs.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks through network transmission, writing to files, or printing sensitive information. Possible execution of system commands or eval statements if present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (user input, environment variables, files) to sinks (network, files, system commands).",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns are evident; lack of obfuscation or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "Based on the available information, the code does not show clear signs of malicious behavior. No suspicious network connections, backdoors, or data exfiltration routines are apparent. Usage of third-party libraries seems standard. The code structure does not reveal obfuscation or hidden behavior. Without seeing specific code lines, the assessment is limited to general patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign based on the provided context and analysis. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected. The overall security risk is low, with moderate confidence due to limited details.",
  "confidence": 0.7,
  "obfuscated": 0,
