  "purpose": "This code defines a class with methods for different mathematical damping functions, possibly for simulation or signal processing purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data through method parameters, especially the variable R passed to multiple functions.",
  "sinks": "The code returns numpy array computations; no explicit sinks for untrusted data leakage or external system interaction are evident.",
  "flows": "Input R flows into various mathematical functions within the class methods, returning processed numpy arrays.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. Usage of numpy and mathematical functions appears standard. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The class implements several mathematical functions using numpy, with behavior controlled by the 'style' parameter. No code injection, data leakage, or suspicious network activity is present. The code structure is straightforward, with clearly defined functions and conditional logic based on 'style'. No hardcoded secrets or anomalies are identified. The code appears to perform standard mathematical computations with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a mathematical utility class without malicious behavior or security risks. It processes input data and returns computations based on selected styles. No malicious or supply chain security issues are evident.",
