{
  "purpose": "The code performs scientific analysis related to radial distribution functions (RDFs), volume calculations, and data fitting, primarily for molecular simulation data.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from files, environment variables, and external libraries; processes data internally without external network communication.",
  "sinks": "No external network activity or data exfiltration detected; data flows are confined within memory and file I/O.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file parsing and data reading functions through internal calculations, deep copies, and scientific computations, with no external communication.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation in variable and class names; complex, convoluted logic that may be for hiding intent but not necessarily malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is complex with heavily obfuscated identifiers, performing scientific calculations typical in RDF analysis, volume, and fit procedures. No signs of malicious payloads, network activity, or sabotage are evident. The obfuscation appears to be for code concealment rather than malicious intent. The data flow is internal, with no external communication or data leaks. The use of standard scientific libraries and deep copies suggests legitimate scientific purpose. The high obfuscation score reflects the confusing naming, but no malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate scientific software with significant obfuscation but no evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. The supply chain risk is minimal, and the malware score should remain at 0. The obfuscation score is high (~0.7), reflecting the code's confusing naming conventions. The overall security risk is low (~0.2), primarily due to obfuscation, but no active threats are detected.",
