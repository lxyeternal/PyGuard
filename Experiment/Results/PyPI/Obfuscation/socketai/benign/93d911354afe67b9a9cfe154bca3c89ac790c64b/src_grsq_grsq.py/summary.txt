  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate scientific software with significant obfuscation but no evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. The supply chain risk is minimal, and the malware score should remain at 0. The obfuscation score is high (~0.7), reflecting the code's confusing naming conventions. The overall security risk is low (~0.2), primarily due to obfuscation, but no active threats are detected."
