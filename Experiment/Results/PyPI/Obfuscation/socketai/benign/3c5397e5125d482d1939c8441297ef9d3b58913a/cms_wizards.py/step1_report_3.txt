{
  "purpose": "Define and register a custom Wizard class for a Django CMS project, involving form and model handling, and register it with a wizard pool.",
  "sources": "Imports from Django, CMS, parler, and treebeard modules; data from models and form classes; input parameters such as title and description.",
  "sinks": "None directly, as the code mainly defines classes and registers a wizard without executing dangerous operations or untrusted data flows.",
  "flows": "Initialization of the wizard object with static parameters and registration into the wizard pool; no untrusted data flows observed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of non-descriptive class and method names; no actual code execution or dynamic data handling; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious strings.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a wizard class inheriting from Django CMS classes, sets up form handling, and registers the wizard with the pool. The method within the wizard class does nothing (returns None). The registration involves creating an instance with static parameters, including a translated title and description, and a form factory. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The structure appears typical for Django CMS plugin development.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django CMS wizard registration with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It mainly involves class definitions and registration, with no suspicious data flows or side effects.",
