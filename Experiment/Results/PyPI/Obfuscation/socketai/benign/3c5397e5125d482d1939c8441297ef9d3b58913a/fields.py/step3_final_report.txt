  "purpose": "Utility classes for safe rendering of Django model data and custom model fields with obfuscated class and method names.",
  "sources": "Model attributes accessed via safe_translation_getter; no external or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "Uses escape and mark_safe for HTML rendering; no external network or file operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from model attribute 'name' through safe_translation_getter into escape and mark_safe functions for safe HTML output.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names; no external data leaks or malicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard Django practices for safe HTML rendering and model field definitions. Obfuscation appears stylistic or proprietary, not malicious. No network activity, data exfiltration, or suspicious logic detected. The use of escape and mark_safe is cautious and appropriate. The obfuscation increases suspicion slightly but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of obfuscated Django utility classes for safe display and model handling, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security threats. The low malware and risk scores are justified. Obfuscation is likely stylistic rather than malicious.",
