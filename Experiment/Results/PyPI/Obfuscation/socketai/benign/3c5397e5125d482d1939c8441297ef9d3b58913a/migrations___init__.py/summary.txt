  "conclusion": "The provided reports accurately assess the security posture of the code snippets. Suspicious features like obfuscation and eval/exec are correctly flagged, and benign cases are appropriately scored. The overall malware score (~0.2-0.3) and obfuscation (~0.2-0.3) reflect the evidence, with Report 2 as the primary concern. No further modifications are needed."
