  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated; it appears to be a generic Python script with no clear functional goal based on the provided fragment.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables and possibly from user input via functions or modules (though not explicitly shown in the fragment).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, network connections, or data outputs, but specific sinks are not explicitly identified in the provided fragment.",
  "flows": "Unclear due to the lack of detailed code; generally, data may flow from sources like environment variables or input functions towards processing or external communication points.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious function calls are visible in the provided snippet. The code structure appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and does not contain any suspicious patterns. There are no indications of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs. Without additional context or more code, it appears benign but limited in scope for a thorough analysis.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code fragment, there are no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears benign, but the lack of detail limits confidence. It is recommended to review the complete code for a comprehensive assessment.",
