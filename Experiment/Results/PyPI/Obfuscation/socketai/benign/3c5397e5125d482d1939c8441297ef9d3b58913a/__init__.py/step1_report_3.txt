  "purpose": "Define version and application module name variables, possibly for configuration purposes.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting string literals to variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input, data leakage, or external data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; just variable assignments.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated-looking variable names and long strings, which could be suspicious. No apparent malicious activity, but the variable naming is unusual and could be intended to hide purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only two variable assignments: one setting a version string ('1.2.0') and another setting a module path string ('aldryn_categories.apps.AldrynCategories'). There is no external input, no network activity, no code execution, or other suspicious behavior. The variable names are nonsensical, which might be an obfuscation attempt or simply non-descriptive naming, but there is no active malicious code or behavior present. Without further context, the code appears benign but somewhat suspicious due to naming conventions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal and only assigns static string values to variables. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks in this fragment. The unusual variable names could be an obfuscation attempt or simply a coding style. Overall, it appears safe but slightly suspicious due to naming.",
