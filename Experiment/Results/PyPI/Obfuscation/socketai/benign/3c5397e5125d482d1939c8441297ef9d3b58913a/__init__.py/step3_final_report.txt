{
  "purpose": "The code assigns static string literals to variables with obfuscated names, likely serving as configuration or metadata.",
  "sources": "No input sources; only static variable assignments.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow, output, or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, but no malicious or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only two variable assignments with obfuscated names, storing version info and module path. No functions, input/output, network activity, or dynamic behavior are present. The obfuscation may be stylistic or for concealment but does not indicate malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with malware scores at 0 and low security risk scores. The obfuscation scores are moderate, reflecting the obscure variable names, but this alone does not imply malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as configuration or metadata with obfuscated variable names. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The current scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
