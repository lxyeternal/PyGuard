  "purpose": "The code appears to define two string variables, likely used for configuration or module identification.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements assigning string literals to variables",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or external output",
  "flows": "Variables assigned from hardcoded string literals; no flow of untrusted data",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names that seem obfuscated or randomly generated, with no apparent purpose",
  "analysis": "The code defines two variables with seemingly random names, storing version info and module path. There are no inputs, outputs, or data flows involving external sources. The variable names suggest obfuscation or automated code generation, but no malicious behavior is evident. No code execution, network activity, or credential handling is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving likely as configuration or metadata. No malicious activity or security risks are apparent.",
