The high obfuscation level warrants caution but does not justify a malicious malware score. The overall security risk is low, and the supply chain security posture is acceptable based on static analysis."

The current malware score is appropriate at 0, obfuscation is notable but not malicious (score ~0.7), and the security risk score remains low at 0.2."

Suspicious features like obfuscation and eval/exec are correctly flagged, and benign cases are appropriately scored. The overall malware score (~0.2-0.3) and obfuscation (~0.2-0.3) reflect the evidence, with Report 2 as the primary concern. No further modifications are needed."

The scores assigned are appropriate, with a low malware and security risk score, and a high obfuscation score justified by the naming pattern."

The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No modifications are necessary; the code is likely benign but warrants cautious monitoring if obfuscation patterns persist elsewhere."
