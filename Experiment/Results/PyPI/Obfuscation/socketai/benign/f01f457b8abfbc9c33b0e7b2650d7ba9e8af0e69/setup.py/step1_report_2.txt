{
  "purpose": "To define the setup configuration for a Python package named 'fhhssfvwfktnxyx3' with specified dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Static code defining package metadata, including 'setup' function call with parameters for name, version, license, modules, dependencies, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "The 'setup' function call itself is not a sink for untrusted data; it merely declares package info and dependencies. No external data input or untrusted data handling is present.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows from sources to sinks; the script is a static configuration script.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual package name 'fhhssfvwfktnxyx3' which appears randomly generated; minimal other anomalies. No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to package a Python module. The package name appears intentionally obfuscated or random, which could be a sign of trying to evade detection. No dynamic code, input handling, or suspicious operations are present. All dependencies are standard, and no malicious behaviors such as network communication, file modification, or data exfiltration are visible.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign package configuration with a possibly intentionally obscure package name. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The risk level is very low.",
