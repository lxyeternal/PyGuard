{
  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script using setuptools, with a suspiciously obfuscated package name.",
  "sources": "Static data in setup() parameters, no dynamic input or external data handling.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows; no network or file system operations.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual, random-looking package name 'fhhssfvwfktnxyx3' which may indicate obfuscation or placeholder.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with no dynamic code, malicious payloads, or obfuscation techniques beyond the package name. The package name's randomness raises suspicion but does not constitute malicious behavior. No code injection, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present. The consistent zero malware scores across reports align with the static, benign nature. Obfuscation scores vary slightly, justified by the package name's appearance, but do not indicate malicious obfuscation. Overall, the script poses minimal security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The package is a benign setup script with an obfuscated package name. No malicious activity or security vulnerabilities are detected. The scores should reflect no malware, slight obfuscation, and very low overall risk.",
