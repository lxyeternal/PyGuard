  "purpose": "Static assignment of author and license metadata strings, no malicious or obfuscated behavior.",
  "sources": "Variable assignments reading static string literals.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; static data assigned to variables.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are nonsensical and obfuscated, but no malicious intent or obfuscation techniques detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string assignments with obfuscated variable names. There are no inputs, outputs, external communications, or dynamic behaviors. The variable names are nonsensical, indicating obfuscation, but this is benign in this context. No data flows or suspicious patterns are present. The code functions as metadata or documentation placeholders. Given the absence of malicious code, data leaks, or malicious behaviors, the malware score is 0. The obfuscation score is low to moderate (~0.2-0.3), justified by variable naming. The security risk score is negligible (~0.1), reflecting the static, metadata nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, containing only static metadata with obfuscated variable names but no malicious activity or security threats. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with minor adjustments to obfuscation and risk levels for consistency.",
