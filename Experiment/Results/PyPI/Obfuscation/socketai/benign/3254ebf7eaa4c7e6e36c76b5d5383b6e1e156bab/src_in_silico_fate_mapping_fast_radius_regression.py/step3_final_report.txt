{
  "purpose": "Implementation of a custom neighbor regressor extending scikit-learn's RadiusNeighborsRegressor with custom weight calculations and sparse matrix operations.",
  "sources": "Input data arrays, 'dist' parameter, and class attributes; data is processed internally without external data leaks.",
  "sinks": "Data flows within numpy arrays and sparse matrices; no external network activity or data exfiltration detected.",
  "flows": "Input data → weight calculation functions → sparse matrix construction → regression prediction methods.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names and convoluted logic; no malicious code, backdoors, or network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard neighbor-based regression tasks with custom weight functions. Obfuscation appears superficial, serving to conceal complexity rather than malicious intent. No external data leaks, network activity, or malicious behaviors are present. The functions and class methods follow typical ML patterns, and no suspicious external calls or data exfiltration are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, albeit obfuscated, implementation of a neighbor regression utility. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation is superficial and likely intended to conceal complexity rather than malicious intent.",
