  "purpose": "Manage the application's cursor state during long operations by setting a wait cursor and restoring it afterward.",
  "sources": "qtpy.QtCore.Qt, qtpy.QtGui.QCursor, qtpy.QtWidgets.QApplication",
  "sinks": "QApplication.setOverrideCursor(), QApplication.restoreOverrideCursor()",
  "flows": "On entering the context, set override cursor; on exit, restore cursor",
  "anomalies": "Function name 'hgyMaAGiyceHVczppuOHXTyrGxSUAuld' is obfuscated or nonsensical",
  "analysis": "The code defines a context manager that temporarily changes the cursor to a wait cursor during a long operation and restores it afterward. It uses standard Qt functions via qtpy, with no external data or network activity involved. The only unusual aspect is the obfuscated function name, which could suggest code hiding but does not imply malicious intent. The code is straightforward, with no security flaws or malicious behavior detected. The obfuscated name warrants suspicion but is not sufficient to classify the code as malicious. Scores reflect benign functionality with moderate obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for cursor management in a Qt application. The obfuscated function name is unusual but not malicious. No security risks or malicious activity are evident. The scores are appropriate, with malware score at 0, obfuscation at around 0.6, and risk at 0.1.",
