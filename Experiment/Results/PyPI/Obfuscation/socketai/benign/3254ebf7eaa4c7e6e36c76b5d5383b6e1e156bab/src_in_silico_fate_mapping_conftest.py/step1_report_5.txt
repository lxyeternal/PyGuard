  "purpose": "Generate synthetic multi-dimensional numpy array data with configurable parameters, potentially for testing or simulation purposes.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions, particularly the function arguments and environment variables if used externally.",
  "sinks": "Return statements that output large numpy arrays; no evident data leakage or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input parameters → data generation via numpy → output numpy array; no external data flows or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "Use of fixed seed in numpy.random.default_rng(42) suggests deterministic output, which is common but not malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. Functions are designed to generate random data, not perform malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to generate large numpy arrays filled with random values, based on input parameters. It uses a fixed seed for reproducibility, which is typical in testing scenarios. The data generated is purely synthetic, with no external data input, external network access, or hidden behaviors. The structure includes fixtures for testing, but these are standard and do not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscated code, no malicious network calls, or suspicious operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign data generation utility intended for testing or simulation purposes. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks. It uses standard numpy functions and testing fixtures without any suspicious side effects.",
