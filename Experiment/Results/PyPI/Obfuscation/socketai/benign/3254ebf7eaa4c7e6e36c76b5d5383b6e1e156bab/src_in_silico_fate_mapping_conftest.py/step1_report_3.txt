  "purpose": "Generate synthetic multidimensional numerical data for testing or analysis purposes.",
  "sources": "np.random.default_rng(42), np.random.normal, np.linspace, np.arange",
  "sinks": "Return statements that output large arrays; no external data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Data generated by random number generator and uniform distributions flow into array computations and are returned.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a fixed seed for the random number generator, which is typical for reproducibility but not malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. The function names and variables are obfuscated but do not imply malicious intent. No external network activity, system modifications, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The script defines functions that generate random numerical data with specific shapes and values, utilizing numpy's random number generation with a fixed seed for reproducibility. It creates structured arrays with specific patterns, likely for simulation or testing. No external input, no data leakage, no system commands, or network activities. The code is complex but appears to be for data synthesis, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation techniques. No suspicious I/O or hidden backdoors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a data generation utility intended for testing or simulation, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The obfuscation seems purely to hinder readability but is not malicious. Overall, it poses no security threat.",
