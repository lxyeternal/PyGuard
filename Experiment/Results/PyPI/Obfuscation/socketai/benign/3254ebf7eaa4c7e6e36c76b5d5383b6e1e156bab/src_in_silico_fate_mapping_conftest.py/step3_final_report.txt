  "purpose": "Synthetic data generation for testing or simulation purposes using numpy with fixed seed for reproducibility.",
  "sources": "Data is generated internally via numpy's random number generator; no external data sources or inputs are used.",
  "sinks": "Outputs large numpy arrays; no external data flow, network activity, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Generated data flows from numpy's random functions into array structures, then returned as reshaped arrays; no external sinks involved.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names, complex array manipulations, but no malicious patterns or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses numpy's random generator with a fixed seed to produce synthetic multi-dimensional arrays. Variable names are intentionally obfuscated, which hampers readability but does not indicate malicious intent. No network, file, or system modification activity is present. The data appears purely synthetic, intended for testing or simulation. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors are found. The obfuscation is superficial and not malicious. The code's purpose aligns with data generation, and there are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious system manipulation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign synthetic data generator used in testing environments. Despite obfuscation, it does not exhibit malicious behavior. The malware score is 0, the security risk score is low (~0.2), and the obfuscation score is justified given the variable naming. Overall, the code is safe and does not pose security threats.",
