{
  "purpose": "The code appears to process CSV files containing track data, extract specific columns, and organize the data into structured formats.",
  "sources": "Input file path provided as string or Path object, which is used to read CSV data via pandas.read_csv.",
  "sinks": "Data extracted from CSV is stored in arrays and dictionaries; no direct data leakage or network transmission observed.",
  "flows": "CSV file path -> pandas.read_csv (reading headers) -> data filtering and extraction -> structured data output.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains obfuscated variable names, functions with non-descriptive names, and unconventional code style, which might suggest concealment. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious strings are visible. The functions do not perform any apparent malicious network activity or system modification.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a list of column mappings, then processes a CSV file by reading its header and checking for specific columns. It filters columns based on inclusion/exclusion rules, raising errors if required columns are missing. The functions manipulate data arrays and return structured data objects. Obfuscation is present through variable and function naming, but no malicious actions or malware behaviors (e.g., network connections, file modifications, or hidden code) are evident. The data flow is limited to reading CSV headers and data extraction. No external network or system actions are performed.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a data processing utility for specific CSV files with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The obfuscation may indicate an attempt to hide its purpose, but no harmful actions are detected. Overall security risk is low.",
