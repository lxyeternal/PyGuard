{
  "purpose": "The code appears to handle CSV file reading and processing, extracting specific columns and transforming data structures related to tracking data.",
  "sources": "Reading file paths from function parameters; accessing file system via Path.exists(); reading CSV files with pandas.read_csv().",
  "sinks": "Returning data structures, raising KeyError exceptions, and potentially processing input data for further use.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (file paths) flow into CSV reading functions, which process and return structured data, with some conditions and key lookups.",
  "anomalies": "Use of non-descriptive, obfuscated variable and function names; presence of hardcoded file extensions; complex control flows with unnecessary checks; no obvious malicious code like network calls or data exfiltration; some inconsistent code, e.g., undefined variable 'svdujsIrFktHyLQyGEKlWLFyORgATQhY' used in return statement.",
  "analysis": "The code obfuscates its purpose with scrambled variable and function names, but fundamentally it reads CSV files, extracts columns, and organizes data into dictionaries. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, system modifications, or hidden backdoors. The code's main function is data extraction and restructuring, with error handling for missing columns. The use of hardcoded file extensions and nested checks seem unnecessary but do not indicate malicious intent. The presence of an undefined variable in the return statement suggests incomplete or broken code, but this does not equate to maliciousness. Overall, it looks like an obfuscated data processing utility without malicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be an intentionally obfuscated data processing script for CSV files with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. Its structure suggests data extraction and transformation tasks without malicious intent, though the obfuscation makes it harder to interpret. No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious network activity is present.",
