{
  "purpose": "Define version information and conditional type aliasing based on a boolean flag.",
  "sources": "The code reads the boolean value 'aiBChcTjXnZdUUrrFKLwCrYkBeQMDGKe' to determine import and type aliasing; it also reads the 'version' string and assigns it to variables.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is used in a risky manner; no I/O, network, or security-sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "The boolean flag controls the import and type aliasing, but there are no data flows from external input to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains obfuscated variable names with no apparent purpose, and the conditional import is unnecessary for functionality. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports 'Tuple' and 'Union' from 'typing' based on a boolean variable, then defines a type alias accordingly. It also assigns a version string and a tuple representing the version. There are no external inputs, no network or file operations, and no suspicious or malicious behavior. The obfuscated variable names seem to serve no purpose beyond obfuscation but do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily defining version info and a conditional type alias. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks are present.",
