{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define version information and type annotations for a package or module, with conditional type aliasing based on a boolean flag.",
  "sources": "The code reads the boolean flag 'aiBChcTjXnZdUUrrFKLwCrYkBeQMDGKe' and the string variables 'version' and 'version_tuple'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; no untrusted data is used in a way that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "The boolean flag determines the type aliasing; version variables are assigned static string and tuple data without involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "The flag 'aiBChcTjXnZdUUrrFKLwCrYkBeQMDGKe' is a randomly named, hardcoded constant set to False; the code contains no user input, no dynamic data, or suspicious behavior. The structure is overly complex for simple version assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a control flow based on a hardcoded boolean, assigning type annotations and version info. There are no functions, external data sources, or suspicious operations. The presence of a meaningless conditional and obfuscated variable names could indicate code obfuscation but does not suggest malicious intent. The static nature of the code indicates it's a benign version declaration setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign version and type annotation setup with obfuscated variable names and an unnecessary conditional. There is no malicious behavior, no data leakage, and no suspicious activity detected. The complexity appears intended to obfuscate but does not contribute to any security threat.",
