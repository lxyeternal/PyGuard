{
  "purpose": "Defines version information with conditional type aliasing based on a static boolean flag, primarily for version tracking or metadata.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of version string and tuple; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static assignments only.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; unnecessary conditional import controlled by a constant boolean; static version info.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a boolean flag to False, then conditionally imports typing constructs and defines a type alias based on that flag. Since the flag is always False, the type alias defaults to 'object'. It also assigns version info to variables with static values. Variable names are intentionally obscure, possibly for obfuscation. There are no external inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors. The code appears to be a benign versioning snippet with obfuscation and unnecessary conditional logic, but no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a version info placeholder with obfuscation and redundant conditional logic. It does not contain malware or security risks. The obfuscation is stylistic rather than malicious, and the overall security risk is negligible.",
