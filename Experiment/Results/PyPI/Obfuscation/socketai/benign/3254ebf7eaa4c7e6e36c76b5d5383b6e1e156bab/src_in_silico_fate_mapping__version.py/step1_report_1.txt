{
  "purpose": "Define version information and type hints for a package or module, with conditional type annotation imports based on a flag.",
  "sources": "Reads the value of the boolean variable 'aiBChcTjXnZdUUrrFKLwCrYkBeQMDGKe' to determine import behavior; assigns version strings and tuples.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code does not handle external inputs or output data vulnerable to injection or leakage.",
  "flows": "The boolean flag controls type annotation imports; version data is assigned directly to variables without involving external data sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a flag to conditionally import typing modules seems unnecessary and could be indicative of obfuscation or attempt to avoid static analysis; variable names are intentionally obscure. No other suspicious or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports type hints based on a boolean flag, which appears redundant. It defines version-related variables with static values. There are no data inputs, outputs, or external interactions that could be exploited. No malicious behavior, code injection, or security risks are evident. Variable names are intentionally obscure, possibly to evade straightforward analysis, but this does not constitute malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily sets version information with obfuscated variable names and conditional imports, but it contains no malicious behavior or security issues. It appears benign, possibly obfuscated for stylistic reasons. No security risks identified.",
