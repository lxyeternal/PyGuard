  "purpose": "The code appears to set version information for a package or module, with conditional type annotations based on a flag.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are read or processed in this code.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flows that lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow from source to sink.",
  "anomalies": "The use of an always false flag (aiBChcTjXnZdUUrrFKLwCrYkBeQMDGKe) to conditionally import typing and define a type alias appears unnecessary and possibly obfuscates intent. No actual malicious behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a boolean variable set to False, then uses it to conditionally import typing modules and define a type alias. Since the flag is always False, the type alias 'npHjzzWHqWUhXtFSOAcLcWUbSayborrl' is set to 'object'. It assigns version strings and tuples, but there is no dynamic input, external data, or code execution. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a version identifier with conditional type annotations that are effectively disabled. No malicious intent or security risks are present.",
