{
  "purpose": "Define version information and conditional type annotations based on a boolean flag.",
  "sources": "The code reads the boolean flag 'aiBChcTjXnZdUUrrFKLwCrYkBeQMDGKe'.",
  "sinks": "No external data sources or sinks are present; no untrusted data handling or output occurs.",
  "flows": "The flow depends on the boolean flag; if True, it imports typing and assigns a complex type annotation; if False, assigns a generic object.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional import and type annotation assignment based on a flag are unusual but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports typing and defines a type alias based on the boolean 'aiBChcTjXnZdUUrrFKLwCrYkBeQMDGKe'. It assigns version strings and tuples, which are standard. No data leaks, malicious imports, or suspicious logic are evident. The structure appears to be for flexible type annotation or version handling, with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a version and type annotation setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
