  "purpose": "Import version information and widget class from the in_silico_fate_mapping package for use in the current module.",
  "sources": "Reading the '_version' and '_widget' modules from the in_silico_fate_mapping package.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no untrusted data is written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Import statements and assignment to __all__ variable; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names (jBxuFWMpbbgzNXlaXjCXnUmfobwCeEzH and vCtelmLEjQSnEgbJJeKbsFjCLVBBRzqw) which appear to be intentionally non-descriptive, possibly to obscure intent. No other suspicious activity or hardcoded secrets observed.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import a version string from a submodule, defaulting to 'unknown' if the import fails. It also imports a widget class and defines __all__ for exports. Variable names are intentionally obfuscated, which can be suspicious, but this pattern alone is not definitive evidence of malicious intent. No network activity, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior detected. The obfuscation may be for licensing or namespace reasons.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard import operations with obfuscated variable names. There is no evident malicious activity or security risk. The obfuscation could be for benign reasons, though it warrants noting. Overall, the code appears safe.",
