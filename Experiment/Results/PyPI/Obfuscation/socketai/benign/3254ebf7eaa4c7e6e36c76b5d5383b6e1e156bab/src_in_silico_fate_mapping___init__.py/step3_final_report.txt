  "purpose": "To perform a supply chain security assessment of the provided Python code snippet, focusing on malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'in_silico_fate_mapping._version' and 'in_silico_fate_mapping._widget', with error handling and obfuscated variable names.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data leaks, network activity, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Import source to variable assignment; no data flow to external sinks or network endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "Use of heavily obfuscated variable names; standard import pattern with error handling; no malicious code or suspicious activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard module imports with error handling, assigning default values upon failure. Variable names are intentionally obfuscated, which is a common practice for namespace management or stylistic reasons but can also be suspicious. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code patterns are present. Malware score is zero, reflecting no malicious intent. Obfuscation scores are high due to variable naming but are justified as benign stylistic choices. Security risk is minimal, consistent with a benign import routine. The overall assessment indicates no evidence of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module setup with obfuscated variable names, likely for stylistic or namespace reasons. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The high obfuscation does not imply malicious intent in this context. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
