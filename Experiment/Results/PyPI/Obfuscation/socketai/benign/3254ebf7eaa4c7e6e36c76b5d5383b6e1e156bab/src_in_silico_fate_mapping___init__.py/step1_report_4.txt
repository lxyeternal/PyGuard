  "sinks": "None explicitly; no untrusted data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Import statements to setting of __all__, no data flow between untrusted sources and sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of non-descriptive variable names for imported modules and version, but no malicious or suspicious code behavior evident.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import a version string and a widget component from a package, with error handling for ImportError. Variable names appear intentionally obfuscated but are used solely for module imports. The __all__ variable limits exported symbols. No code execution, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors are present. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or obfuscation techniques are detected. The code is straightforward and serves as module setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard import setup with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger module's initialization.",
