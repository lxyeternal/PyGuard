  "purpose": "Import version information and a widget component from the in_silico_fate_mapping package, with fallback for missing version.",
  "sources": "Reading from in_silico_fate_mapping._version and in_silico_fate_mapping._widget modules",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; no data is written to external sources or untrusted outputs",
  "flows": "Data flows from imported modules into internal variables; no external data flows identified",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names (jBxuFWMpbbgzNXlaXjCXnUmfobwCeEzH, vCtelmLEjQSnEgbJJeKbsFjCLVBBRzqw), but this is a common pattern for minimizing conflicts or code obfuscation; no hardcoded credentials or malicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import a version string and a widget class from the in_silico_fate_mapping package, with a fallback for the version if the import fails. The variable names are intentionally obfuscated, but the import structure is standard. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code is minimal and appears to serve a typical module import purpose, potentially with obfuscated naming to prevent easy reverse engineering, but not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module import with obfuscated variable names. There are no indications of malicious intent, security risks, or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a normal part of a larger package, possibly designed to hide variable names but not maliciously so.",
