  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Input data reading points, such as environment variables, user inputs, network calls, file reads, or external libraries.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network transmissions, file modifications, or system commands that could be exploited if untrusted data is processed.",
  "flows": "Data flow from sources to sinks, including any code that processes untrusted input leading to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscation, unusual network activity, backdoors, or malicious code snippets.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets are either incomplete, obfuscated, or minimal, with no evidence of malicious behavior such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors. Obfuscation suspicion in some reports is acknowledged but not confirmed. No suspicious input/output handling, insecure functions, or malicious payloads are detected. The overall structure and content suggest benign code, with scores reflecting low threat levels. The confidence scores align with the clarity and completeness of the code, and no anomalies are present that indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The low malware and security risk scores are justified, and the cautious obfuscation suspicion in some reports is reasonable but not indicative of malicious intent. Overall, the dependency is considered safe based on the provided analysis.",
