  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Limited code snippets; potential data sources include environment variables, user input, external files.",
  "sinks": "Potential network, file, subprocess operations, but no explicit code provided.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (environment, input) to sinks (network, files), but no concrete flows observed.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0) are appropriate given the limited information. The security risk scores are low (~0.2-0.3), reflecting minimal concern. Confidence levels are reasonable, higher where code snippets are present, lower where no code is available. No evidence suggests malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency appears benign with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The low security risk scores are justified, and the assessments are consistent and well-founded. No adjustments needed.",
