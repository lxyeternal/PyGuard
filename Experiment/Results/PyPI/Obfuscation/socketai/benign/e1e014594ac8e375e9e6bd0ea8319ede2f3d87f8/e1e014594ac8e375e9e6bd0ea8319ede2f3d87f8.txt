      "conclusion": "The script contains an obfuscated, non-standard parameter that raises suspicion but does not demonstrate active malicious behavior. The high obfuscation score is justified, and the malware risk remains low. The overall security risk is moderate due to potential concealment. Further investigation into the source and intent of this setup script is recommended, but based on current evidence, the code is not malicious."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation and risky eval() usage, creating a significant security concern. While no explicit malware or malicious payloads are confirmed, the pattern of dynamic evaluation could be exploited. The scores assigned in the reports (malware around 0.3-0.4, obfuscation high, risk around 0.7) are justified and consistent with the analysis. Refactoring to eliminate or sanitize eval() calls is strongly recommended to mitigate potential vulnerabilities."
