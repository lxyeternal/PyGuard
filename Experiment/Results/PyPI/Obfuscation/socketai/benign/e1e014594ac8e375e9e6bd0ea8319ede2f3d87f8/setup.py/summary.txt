  "conclusion": "The script contains an obfuscated, non-standard parameter that raises suspicion but does not demonstrate active malicious behavior. The high obfuscation score is justified, and the malware risk remains low. The overall security risk is moderate due to potential concealment. Further investigation into the source and intent of this setup script is recommended, but based on current evidence, the code is not malicious."
