  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for package distribution.",
  "sources": "The 'setup()' function call and its parameters, especially the non-standard parameter 'ZjnJwJTiYCDcDhStGyeMWcDvRJGcgETn' containing dependencies.",
  "sinks": "The non-standard parameter could be used to hide dependencies or malicious code; no explicit sinks are present in the code.",
  "flows": "The list assigned to the suspicious parameter is not used elsewhere; no data flows to or from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of an obfuscated, non-standard parameter 'ZjnJwJTiYCDcDhStGyeMWcDvRJGcgETn' with dependency list; variable name is random and not recognized by setuptools.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with a suspicious, obfuscated parameter that is not recognized by setuptools, indicating potential obfuscation or concealment. No malicious code, dynamic execution, or network activity is present. The obfuscated parameter's presence suggests an attempt to hide dependencies or malicious behavior, but no active malicious actions are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (obfuscation 0.7, malware 0.2, security risk 0.4) are appropriate given the suspicion but lack of concrete malicious activity. The obfuscation warrants caution, especially in supply chain contexts, but the code itself appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains an obfuscated, non-standard parameter that raises suspicion but does not demonstrate active malicious behavior. The high obfuscation score is justified, and the malware risk remains low. The overall security risk is moderate due to potential concealment. Further investigation into the source and intent of this setup script is recommended, but based on current evidence, the code is not malicious.",
