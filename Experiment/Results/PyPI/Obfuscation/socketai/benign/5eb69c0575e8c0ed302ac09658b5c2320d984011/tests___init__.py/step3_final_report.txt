  "purpose": "The code appears to be a minimal or placeholder script with no clear functionality or malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Modules imported, environment variables, and potential input functions (though specifics are not provided).",
  "sinks": "Potential system, network, or file operations if present, but no explicit sinks are identified due to limited code context.",
  "flows": "Data flow from sources (inputs/environment) to sinks (system/network), but no concrete flow is observable in the snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors detected; code appears benign.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet is minimal with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The purpose is unclear, but no indicators of malicious activity are present. The security risk score is low (0.2), reflecting the limited context. Malware score is 0, consistent with the absence of malicious patterns. Confidence is moderate (0.6), acknowledging incomplete information.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there is no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk score is appropriate given the limited context. The code appears benign, and no immediate threats are identified.",
