  "purpose": "Assess the security implications of importing all symbols from the 'remarshal.main' module in Python code.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from remarshal.main import *' itself; no other code provided.",
  "sinks": "Potentially any functions or variables imported from 'remarshal.main' that could be used maliciously later in the code.",
  "flows": "Importing symbols from 'remarshal.main' (source) into the current namespace (sink), which could be exploited if the module contains malicious functions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import, which obscures imported symbols; no evidence of malicious code or obfuscation in the snippet itself.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a wildcard import from 'remarshal.main', which is discouraged due to namespace pollution and difficulty in static analysis. No malicious activity or obfuscation is evident solely from this line. The 'remarshal' library is an open-source serialization tool, generally benign. The primary concern is that such imports can hide malicious functions if the module is compromised. The malware score is set to 0, consistent with the lack of evidence. The security risk score is low (~0.2), reflecting the potential for hidden symbols but not an active threat. Confidence in this assessment is high (0.9), given the limited context. Overall, the code is low risk but warrants further review of the 'remarshal.main' module to confirm safety.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement alone does not indicate malicious activity. The main concern is the use of 'import *', which hampers clarity and security auditing. No malware or obfuscation is present. The overall security risk is minimal, but further inspection of the imported module is recommended to ensure it does not contain malicious code or side effects.",
