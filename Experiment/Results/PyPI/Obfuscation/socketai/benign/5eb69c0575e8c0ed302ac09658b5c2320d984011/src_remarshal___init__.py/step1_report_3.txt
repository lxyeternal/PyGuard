  "purpose": "Import all functions and classes from the remarshal.main module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from remarshal.main",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "Not applicable; only an import statement",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import (from module import *) can lead to namespace pollution and obscure code behavior; no malicious activity evident from import alone",
  "analysis": "The code contains a single import statement that brings all public symbols from the remarshal.main module into the current namespace. This practice can hide which functions or variables are used and complicate security auditing. The remarshal library is an open-source package that handles serialization/deserialization, and simply importing it does not indicate malicious intent. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious code execution in this line alone. The statement does not perform any operations or data flows.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists solely of an import statement from a third-party module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks based on this line alone. The use of wildcard import is a best practice violation but not malicious.",
