  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports are based solely on a single import statement: `from remarshal.main import *`.\n- No subsequent code or data flows are provided, limiting the ability to detect malicious activity directly.\n- The main concern revolves around the use of `import *`, which can obscure what functions or variables are imported, potentially hiding malicious or unintended code.\n- The `remarshal` package is an open-source serialization/deserialization library, which by itself is unlikely to be malicious.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent is present in this import statement alone.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming Issues in the Code\n\n**Issue Presence:**  \n- The code is just an import statement with a wildcard. It does **not** contain any malicious code or behavior itself.\n- The concern is about the *potential* misuse or hidden malicious code within `remarshal.main`, which cannot be determined from this line alone.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- No malicious behavior is directly observable in the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes in the Reports\n\n- All reports correctly identify the use of `import *` as a potential concern for code clarity and security, which is valid.\n- They correctly note that without further context, no malicious activity can be confirmed.\n- The reasoning is consistent; no logical flaws are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Score Review and Justification\n\n**Malware Scores:**  \n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the information.\n- Since no malicious code is evident, a malware score > 0 would be unjustified.\n\n**Obfuscated Scores:**  \n- All reports assign 0, which is reasonable; there's no obfuscation evident.\n\n**Risk Scores:**  \n- The risk scores vary from 0.1 to 0.3, primarily due to the use of `import *` and potential for hidden issues.\n- Given the lack of evidence, a risk score higher than 0.3 seems unwarranted. The scores are generally reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\n- The reports suggest further review of `remarshal.main`. While this is prudent, the import statement alone doesn't indicate malicious intent.\n- The use of `import *` is discouraged but not inherently malicious; it warrants caution but isn't a security breach by itself.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment and Recommendations\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n| Score Type      | Reasoning                                                                                   |\n|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | **0** — No evidence of malicious code or behavior in the import statement.                |\n| Obfuscated     | **0** — No obfuscation present.                                                             |\n| Risk           | **0.1** — Slight concern due to wildcard import obscuring symbols, but overall low risk. |\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code snippet itself is benign.\n- The primary concern is the use of `import *`, which can hide malicious or unintended functions if the module is malicious or compromised.\n- Further review of `remarshal.main` is recommended but not justified solely based on this import line.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nAlways review the actual content of the imported module and subsequent code to accurately assess security risks. The import statement alone, especially from a well-known open-source package, does not constitute a security threat.",
