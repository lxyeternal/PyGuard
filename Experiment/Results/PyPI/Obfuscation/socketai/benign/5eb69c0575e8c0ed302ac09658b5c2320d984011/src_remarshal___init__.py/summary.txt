  "conclusion": "The import statement alone does not indicate malicious activity. The main concern is the use of 'import *', which hampers clarity and security auditing. No malware or obfuscation is present. The overall security risk is minimal, but further inspection of the imported module is recommended to ensure it does not contain malicious code or side effects."
