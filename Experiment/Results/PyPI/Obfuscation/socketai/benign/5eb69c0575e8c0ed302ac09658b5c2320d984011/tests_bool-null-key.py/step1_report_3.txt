{
  "purpose": "This code creates a Python dictionary with mixed key types, including booleans, strings, and None.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data leaks or outputs are present; the code simply defines a dictionary.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; no data flow analysis needed as no input/output operations are present.",
  "anomalies": "Using boolean values (True, False) and None as dictionary keys is unusual but syntactically valid in Python; no malicious intent evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a dictionary with keys of various data types. No external input, network access, or dynamic execution present. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code. The structure is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns or potential security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple dictionary definition with non-standard key types, which does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks.",
