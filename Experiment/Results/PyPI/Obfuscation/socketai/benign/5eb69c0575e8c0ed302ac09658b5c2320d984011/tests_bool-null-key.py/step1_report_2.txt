{
  "purpose": "Defines a Python dictionary with various key-value pairs, including boolean and None keys.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; the code statically defines a dictionary.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; static dictionary declaration.",
  "anomalies": "Uses boolean and None as dictionary keys, which is valid but somewhat unusual; no malicious intent observed.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a dictionary with keys of different types: True, False, a string 'another', and None. These are standard Python data types used as dictionary keys. There are no external data sources, no user input, no environment variables, and no suspicious function calls. No obfuscated code, malicious logic, or malicious behavior detected. The code appears to be a straightforward dictionary definition. No security issues or malicious activities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple dictionary declaration with standard Python syntax and data types. It shows no signs of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
