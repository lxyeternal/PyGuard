  "purpose": "Defines a Python dictionary with various key types and string values.",
  "sources": "N/A (no input or data reading occurring in this code fragment).",
  "sinks": "N/A (no data output, file writing, network communication, or untrusted data handling).",
  "flows": "N/A (no data flow from source to sink).",
  "anomalies": "Using non-string keys such as True, False, and None as dictionary keys is unusual but not inherently malicious; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a dictionary with keys of different data types, including booleans and None, mapping to string values. There is no indication of input reading, data leakage, network activity, or malicious logic. The structure and content appear normal and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple dictionary declaration with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It does not perform any suspicious operations or contain any malware indicators.",
