{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Python dictionary with various key-value pairs, including boolean and None keys.",
  "sources": "The dictionary itself as a data structure; no external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data flows into potentially dangerous operations.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code is static data assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Using boolean and None as dictionary keys is unusual but syntactically valid; no evidence of obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a dictionary with keys: True, False, 'another', and None, mapped to string values. There are no input operations, no dynamic code execution, no external data, and no suspicious behavior. The structure appears to be static and straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple static dictionary definition with unusual but valid keys. It does not contain malicious behavior, security issues, or obfuscation. The risk level is negligible.",
