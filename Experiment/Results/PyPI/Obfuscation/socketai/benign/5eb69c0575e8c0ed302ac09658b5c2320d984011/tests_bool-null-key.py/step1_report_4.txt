{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Python dictionary with various key-value pairs, including boolean and None keys.",
  "sources": "The dictionary definition itself, which provides static data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow to external systems or untrusted sources; no data is being transmitted or executed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is purely a static dictionary assignment.",
  "anomalies": "The use of boolean and None as dictionary keys is unusual but syntactically valid in Python; no signs of malicious obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward dictionary initialization with mixed key types. No input is read at runtime, no data is sent externally, and there are no dynamic code execution or suspicious patterns. The key usage is unconventional but not malicious. The code appears purely static and safe.",
  "conclusion": "There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this code snippet. It is a simple, static dictionary definition with no malicious intent or suspicious activity.",
