  "purpose": "Static definition of a Python dictionary with mixed key types (booleans, None, string).",
  "sources": "No external input, data read from static code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs; no untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static data structure.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual use of boolean and None as dictionary keys, but valid in Python.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static dictionary with mixed key types, including booleans and None. No dynamic code, input/output, or external data sources are involved. The use of non-string keys is unconventional but valid. No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is benign, and the scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all appropriately zero. The confidence in this assessment is high, given the static and simple nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static dictionary with unconventional but valid keys. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk detected. The scores should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
