  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate data format conversion utility with no malicious or security-critical issues. The obfuscated class is inert and harmless. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is superficial (score ~0.1), and overall security risk is very low (~0.1). The reports' assessments are consistent and justified."
