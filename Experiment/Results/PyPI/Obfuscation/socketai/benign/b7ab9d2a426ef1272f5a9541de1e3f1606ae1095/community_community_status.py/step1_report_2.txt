  "purpose": "Class definition for handling multiple data points in a structured manner, intended as a replacement for named tuples for compatibility reasons.",
  "sources": "No data input sources or data reading mechanisms are present in this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or output mechanisms are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is observable in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The class name appears to be a nonsensical or obfuscated string, which can be suspicious but could also be a non-malicious obfuscation or placeholder. The docstring is generic and does not contain executable code. No further code, methods, or logic are provided that could be malicious.",
  "analysis": "The provided code only includes a class definition with a descriptive docstring. There are no data inputs, outputs, or executable logic, nor any suspicious code constructs such as dynamic execution, network communication, or credential handling. The unusual class name may warrant further review, but on its own, it is not indicative of malicious behavior. The lack of code activity or external interactions suggests a benign purpose, though limited context restricts full assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet appears to be a benign class declaration with a generic docstring, showing no signs of malicious behavior. The unusual class name is noteworthy but not inherently malicious. More code would be needed for a thorough security assessment.",
