{
  "purpose": "The code imports functions from a local module 'community_louvain' and defines two static variables, likely for versioning and contact info.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the local module and static variable assignments.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, network activity, or output handling present.",
  "flows": "Import statements and variable assignments are static; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated or randomly generated variable names; no malicious code or dynamic behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of imports and static variable definitions. No external input, data processing, or network activity is present. Variable names are obfuscated but do not indicate malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports correctly reflect the benign nature, with malware scores at zero and low security risk. Obfuscation scores are justified by variable naming but are not suspicious. Overall, the code shows no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious activity detected. Obfuscation is minimal and not indicative of malicious intent. The current scoring in the reports is appropriate; no adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
