  "purpose": "Import modules from the 'lemniscat' library for runtime operations and version management.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from 'lemniscat.runtime.lem' and 'lemniscat.runtime.version'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows are present.",
  "flows": "N/A - only static imports with no runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected in the code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from a third-party library. No dynamic code execution, data leaks, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are evident. The 'lemniscat' library's presence alone does not imply malicious intent. The high confidence scores reflect that these lines are benign. Given the minimal code, the malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk is very low (~0.1). No signs of malicious behavior or security issues are identified in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, containing only straightforward import statements. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks based on these lines. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
