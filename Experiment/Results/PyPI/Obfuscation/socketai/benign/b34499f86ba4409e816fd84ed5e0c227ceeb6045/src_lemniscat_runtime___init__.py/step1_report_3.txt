{
  "purpose": "Import modules from the lemniscat.runtime package, likely to access functions or classes defined within those modules.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing 'lemniscat.runtime.lem' and 'lemniscat.runtime.version'. These are static imports, not reading user input or external data at runtime.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows involving untrusted data, user input, or network operations are present in these lines.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks since only static imports are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code only contains import statements; no unusual patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific modules from the 'lemniscat.runtime' package. Import statements alone are not suspicious. There is no evidence of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or data leaks. The imported modules could be benign or malicious, but based solely on these lines, there's no indication of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code consists solely of import statements from a package named 'lemniscat.runtime'. No malicious activity or security risks are evident in these lines. Without further context or code execution, it appears benign.",
