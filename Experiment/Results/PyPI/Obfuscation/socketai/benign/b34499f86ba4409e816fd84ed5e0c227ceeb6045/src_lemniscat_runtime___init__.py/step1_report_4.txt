  "purpose": "The code imports modules from the 'lemniscat' package, likely to use functionalities related to 'runtime' and 'version'.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'lemniscat.runtime.lem' and 'lemniscat.runtime.version'.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs present in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "N/A – only import statements with no data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not contain any anomalies; imports are straightforward and use standard syntax. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two import statements importing specific modules from the 'lemniscat' package. There is no execution of code, data handling, or communication. The package 'lemniscat' is publicly available and used for legitimate purposes in various projects. Without additional context, the code appears benign. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a minimal set of import statements that appears to be part of a larger project. It does not contain any malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or security risks on its own.",
