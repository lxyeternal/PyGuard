{
  "purpose": "The code imports modules from the lemniscat library, likely to utilize functions or classes from these modules.",
  "sources": "Imports from lemniscat.runtime.lem and lemniscat.runtime.version",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or outputs are visible in these import statements",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink can be determined from import statements alone",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'lemniscat' library, which is less common; no evidence of obfuscation or malicious code; only import statements with no further code",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from a third-party library 'lemniscat'. Without additional code, it's impossible to determine intent or malicious behavior. The library itself is not inherently malicious, but without context, potential concerns include the library's functionality. No suspicious patterns or malicious code are present in these imports.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code only performs imports, which by itself are not suspicious. Further context is needed for a comprehensive assessment.",
