  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI setup for a task orchestrator with obfuscated function names that do not suggest malicious intent. There is no evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. Obfuscation is superficial and likely intended to hinder readability but not malicious. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score is zero."
