  "conclusion": "The analysis indicates a high likelihood of malicious behavior in the code described in Report 1, with appropriate scores reflecting suspicious patterns. Other reports lack code or show benign patterns, with scores correctly set to zero. Minor obfuscation suspicion is acknowledged. Overall, the scores are consistent with the behaviors described, and the assessment supports cautious handling of the dependency, especially if behaviors are confirmed."
