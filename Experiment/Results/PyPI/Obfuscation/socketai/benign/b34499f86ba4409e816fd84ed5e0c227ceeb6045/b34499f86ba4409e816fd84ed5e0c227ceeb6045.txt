There is no evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. Obfuscation is superficial and likely intended to hinder readability but not malicious. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score is zero."

All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious activity and assign appropriate low scores. The risk remains negligible unless actual plugin loading code is introduced, especially from untrusted sources. The scores should remain at zero for malware and obfuscation, with a very low security risk score (~0.1) to account for potential risks if implementation details are added later."

Other reports lack code or show benign patterns, with scores correctly set to zero. Minor obfuscation suspicion is acknowledged. Overall, the scores are consistent with the behaviors described, and the assessment supports cautious handling of the dependency, especially if behaviors are confirmed."
