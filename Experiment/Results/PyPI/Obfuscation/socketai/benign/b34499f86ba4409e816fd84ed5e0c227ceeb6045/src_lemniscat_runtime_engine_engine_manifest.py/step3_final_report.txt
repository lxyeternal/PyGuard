    "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided reports.",
    "sources": "Code snippets, dynamic execution points, network activity, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated patterns, input/output handling.",
    "sinks": "Network connections, file modifications, environment variable access, data leaks, eval/exec calls.",
    "flows": "Sources such as input data or environment variables flow into sinks like network transmission or file writes, potentially via obfuscated or dynamic code execution.",
    "anomalies": "High obfuscation scores (e.g., 0.8), signs of dynamic eval/exec, suspicious network activity, hardcoded secrets, inconsistent or missing code with high suspicion indicators.",
    "analysis": "Most reports correctly identify absence of code and assign zero scores where appropriate. Report 2 describes obfuscation and dynamic behavior with scores: obfuscated=0.8, malware=0.6, risk=0.65, which are justified by the described signs. Minor adjustments include increasing malware to 0.7 for stronger suspicion or lowering the security risk in reports lacking evidence. Overall, the scores are consistent with the analysis. The highest observed obfuscation score (0.8) suggests an overall obfuscated score around 0.75, and the malware score around 0.65 reflects suspicion without confirmed malicious payloads. The overall security risk is balanced around 0.4–0.6, considering the signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution but no confirmed malicious activity.",
    "conclusion": "The reports are generally accurate; the most suspicious code (Report 2) warrants a malware score around 0.65–0.7, with high obfuscation (around 0.75). Reports with no code or evidence are correctly scored at zero. Slight score adjustments improve consistency, but current assessments are reasonable. Overall, the supply chain security posture remains cautious but justified based on the available signals.",
