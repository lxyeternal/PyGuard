  "anomalies": "Absence of actual code; only a comment or descriptive text.",
  "analysis": "The snippet is purely a comment with no implementation, data handling, or logic. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are present. The lack of executable code means no potential for malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities can be inferred. The scores assigned in the reports reflect this minimal content, with malware and obfuscation scores at zero and very low security risk scores. The high confidence in some reports is inconsistent with the minimal content but does not impact the overall assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is only a descriptive comment with no executable logic or security concerns. All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious activity and assign appropriate low scores. The risk remains negligible unless actual plugin loading code is introduced, especially from untrusted sources. The scores should remain at zero for malware and obfuscation, with a very low security risk score (~0.1) to account for potential risks if implementation details are added later.",
