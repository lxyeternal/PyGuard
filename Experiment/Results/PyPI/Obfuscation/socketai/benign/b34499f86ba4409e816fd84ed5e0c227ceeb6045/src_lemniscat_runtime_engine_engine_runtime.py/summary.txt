  "conclusion": "The code snippet is only a descriptive comment with no executable logic or security concerns. All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious activity and assign appropriate low scores. The risk remains negligible unless actual plugin loading code is introduced, especially from untrusted sources. The scores should remain at zero for malware and obfuscation, with a very low security risk score (~0.1) to account for potential risks if implementation details are added later."
