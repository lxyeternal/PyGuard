  "purpose": "The purpose of this code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to import modules and possibly perform some network or system operations.",
  "sources": "Potential sources include imported modules and any functions or methods that read input, environment variables, or files. Specific sources are not visible due to missing code content.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, system commands, or data exfiltration points, which are not explicitly shown in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "Without the actual code, it is not possible to identify specific data flows from source to sink. The analysis is limited due to the absence of code content.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious function calls, or unusual patterns, are observable in the provided snippet. Lack of code details limits deeper analysis.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet provided is empty or incomplete, preventing thorough review. Without actual code, it is impossible to identify sources, sinks, flows, or anomalies. No suspicious patterns or malicious indicators are evident in the current fragment.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available information, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign or incomplete. Further review with complete code is necessary for a definitive assessment.",
