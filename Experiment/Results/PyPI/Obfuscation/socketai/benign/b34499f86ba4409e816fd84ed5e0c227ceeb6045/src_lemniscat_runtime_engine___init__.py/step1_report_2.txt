{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script intended for data processing or computation, but the specific purpose is unclear without additional context.",
  "sources": "Data inputs may come from user input functions, external files, environment variables, or network requests, though none are explicitly visible in the provided code snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leak points include print statements, file writes, network transmissions, or environment variable access, but none are explicitly identified here.",
  "flows": "Without concrete source or sink references in the code, it is difficult to define exact source-to-sink flows. The code's flow seems to involve data processing steps without external data exposure.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious function names, or unusual code constructs are observed. The code does not contain obfuscated patterns or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward and uses standard Python constructs. No malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communication to suspicious domains, or system manipulation is evident. The code does not appear to contain malware, backdoors, or malicious intents. Its structure and logic are typical of benign scripts, with no signs of obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard, benign Python script with no suspicious activity detected.",
