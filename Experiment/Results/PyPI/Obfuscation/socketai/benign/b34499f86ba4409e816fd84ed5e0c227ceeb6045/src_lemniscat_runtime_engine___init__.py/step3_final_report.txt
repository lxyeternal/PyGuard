  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, network sources, system calls, files, dynamic code evaluation.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, system commands, files, subprocesses, environment variables.",
  "flows": "Data from sources (environment, input, network) to sinks (network, system, files) via code execution paths.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated code, dynamic eval/exec, suspicious imports, hardcoded strings, dynamic code evaluation.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits moderate obfuscation (score 0.4) and dynamic code evaluation, which are red flags but no explicit malicious payloads are observed. The overall structure suggests potential misuse pathways but lacks concrete malicious activity. In the absence of code, assessments are cautious, assigning low malware (0) and low to moderate security risk (0.3). The scores are consistent with the analysis, with obfuscation and dynamic evaluation being the primary concerns. The code's benign appearance in reports without obfuscation or suspicious patterns supports low malware and risk scores. Continuous monitoring is recommended for obfuscated or dynamically evaluated code segments.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency shows no definitive malicious activity; obfuscation and dynamic code evaluation are noted but not confirmed malicious. Scores are justified and consistent with the provided analyses. No immediate action required, but ongoing vigilance is advised.",
