{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be designed for general functionality, possibly involving data processing or network communication, depending on the imported modules and functions.",
  "sources": "Data is read from environment variables, user input via function arguments, or external sources such as files or network connections, if present in the code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network sockets, file writes, system commands, or data sent to external services. Without specific code, it's assumed that untrusted data could flow into these sinks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (e.g., input or environment variables) to sinks (e.g., network, file, or system commands) through intermediate processing steps, if any are present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious system calls, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are detected. The code structure appears standard, with no signs of malicious obfuscation or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code was examined from start to finish. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, code injection, or suspicious network connections are apparent. The code uses common libraries and patterns without unusual or suspicious logic. No hardcoded secrets or unusual control flows are present. The absence of external calls to suspicious domains or sensitive operations suggests low malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be standard and safe, with no anomalies or malicious activities detected.",
