{
  "purpose": "To assess the supply chain security and potential malicious behavior of the open source dependency based on provided code review reports.",
  "sources": "The code snippets reviewed in the reports, focusing on suspicious functions, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, and anomalous patterns.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, execution of malicious functions (eval, exec), network communications, or modifications to system files.",
  "flows": "Input sources such as user data or environment variables flow into functions like eval(), exec(), or network calls, which could lead to malicious actions if present.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious functions, obfuscation, or anomalies in the code snippets; reports consistently note benign patterns.",
  "analysis": "All five reports conclude no malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks, assigning malware scores of 0 and low security risk scores (~0.2-0.3). Confidence levels are moderate to high, reflecting cautious but consistent assessments. The reports are internally consistent and align with each other, indicating no evident malicious intent or sabotage in the reviewed code snippets.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the comprehensive review, the dependency appears benign with no detectable malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk scores are appropriate, and the malware scores of 0 are justified. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.2,
