  "review": "Let's carefully analyze each report and the provided code snippet.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports indicate that the code snippet is purely descriptive, consisting only of comments and parameter annotations.\n- No executable code, data processing, or system interactions are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, suspicious patterns, or malicious behaviors are identified.\n- The confidence levels are generally high (around 0.9), which aligns with the fact that the code is non-executable documentation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **Yes.** All reports correctly note that the snippet contains only comments and parameter descriptions, with no actual implementation.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- The reports are consistent in pointing out the lack of executable logic.\n- No logical errors are evident since there's no code to analyze.\n- The main flaw is that the reports treat documentation as if it could contain security issues, but since there's no code, this is more a matter of incomplete code snippets rather than actual vulnerabilities.\n\n### Scores Review:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Also zero, which is correct.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Zero, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Potential adjustments:**\n- Since the code is purely documentation, the risk and malware scores should remain at 0.\n- The confidence scores are high, which is reasonable given the detailed comments.\n\n### Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.5, so no adjustment needed here.\n- If any report had assigned a higher risk, it would be unjustified given the lack of executable code.\n\n### Challenging Assumptions:\n- The reports assume the code could involve dynamic imports or filesystem operations, but since no such code exists, these are mere possibilities, not actual risks.\n- No evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent exists in the provided snippet.\n\n### Consistency of Scores:\n- All scores are consistent with the content (comments only, no executable code).\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Overall malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports correctly identify the absence of code and malicious activity. They are cautious but accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code snippet is purely descriptive documentation with no executable or malicious elements. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no changes are necessary. The overall security assessment should reflect that there is no risk or malware present based on the provided information.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis.",
