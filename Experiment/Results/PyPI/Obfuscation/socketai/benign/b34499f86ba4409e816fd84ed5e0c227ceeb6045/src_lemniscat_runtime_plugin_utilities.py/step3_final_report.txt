{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for filtering directories and managing plugin configurations, primarily through comments and parameter annotations.",
  "sources": "Parameter definitions and comments indicating input parameters such as plugins_package, package_name, and module_name.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No executable data flow exists; the snippet contains only descriptive comments without logic.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of actual code, only comments and parameter descriptions; no suspicious or unusual code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The provided snippet consists solely of comments and parameter annotations with no executable logic or system interactions. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The code appears to be documentation or placeholders rather than functional code. Given the lack of implementation, there are no security risks or malicious behaviors to evaluate. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the evidence. Confidence levels are high where the code is clearly only comments, and slightly lower where the code is incomplete or only described.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is purely descriptive documentation with no executable or malicious elements. The security risk, malware, and obfuscation scores are correctly set to zero. No further action or concern is warranted based on the provided information.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
