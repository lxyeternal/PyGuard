  "flows": "Input parameters flow through the configuration functions, with no indication of data manipulation or transfer to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Lack of actual implementation code; only docstrings or comments are present without executable logic or security-sensitive operations.",
  "analysis": "The code fragment consists solely of descriptive comments and parameter annotations. No actual logic, data handling, or external interactions are present to analyze for security issues. Without executable code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, suspicious data flows, or security risks.",
