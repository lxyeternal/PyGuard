  "purpose": "Provides functionality to filter directories and handle package/module configuration",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'plugins_package', 'package_name', 'module_name'",
  "sinks": "Potentially none explicitly, but could involve dynamic imports or file system operations if expanded",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into filtering and configuration logic (not explicitly shown in the snippet)",
  "anomalies": "Code snippet contains only comments and parameter descriptions; no executable logic, no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors",
  "analysis": "The provided code consists solely of descriptive comments outlining functions for filtering directories and handling package/module configuration. There are no actual executable statements, no data reads, or any dynamic code execution present. The comments suggest intended functionality but do not include implementations that could be analyzed for malicious behavior or security issues. Given the absence of code logic, there are no suspicious or malicious elements detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is purely descriptive documentation with no executable or malicious code. It does not pose any security risks or malicious behavior concerns.",
