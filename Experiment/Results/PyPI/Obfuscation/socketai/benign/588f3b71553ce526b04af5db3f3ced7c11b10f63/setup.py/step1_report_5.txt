  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'pampy' Python package, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file; importing the 'pampy' module; reading package version from an obfuscated variable.",
  "sinks": "Potentially passing untrusted data (though here, it's static) to setuptools.setup; no external data sinks evident.",
  "flows": "Reading the README file content into a variable; passing this variable to the setup function; using an imported module to get version info.",
  "anomalies": "The imported module 'pampy' is imported with an unusual, seemingly random name 'FOcruQqERhayRLLuccxNiMEbOOCrEnCT'; the variable names used for data are nonsensical and obfuscated; no explicit version string, instead a variable that may be dynamically set.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' for packaging. It imports 'pampy' with an obfuscated name, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. The version is obtained from a variable with a random name, which could be dynamic, but there is no code showing dynamic execution or malicious payloads. Reading the README file is standard for setup scripts. No untrusted input sources or external data processing are present. The obfuscated import and variable names are suspicious but could be intentional obfuscation, not necessarily malicious. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious actions are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This appears to be a standard setup script for a Python package with obfuscated variable and module names. The obfuscation alone does not indicate malicious intent. No malicious behavior, security risks, or malware are evident based on this code.",
