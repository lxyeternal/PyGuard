  "conclusion": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and complex data handling that could conceal malicious activity, but no explicit malicious actions are detected. The primary concern is the external function, which warrants further investigation. Overall, the code should be treated with caution, with a malware score around 0.4, reflecting moderate suspicion due to obfuscation and unknown behavior."
