{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a sample or utility script that performs basic data processing, likely intended for data transformation or preparation tasks.",
  "sources": "Potential data inputs include user input via standard input (e.g., input() function), environment variables, or external files read using open().",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive sinks include print() statements, file writes, or network transmissions if present; however, no such actions are evident without further context.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as user input or files through processing functions and then to output or storage sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, unusual variable naming, or suspicious dynamic code execution detected. No obfuscated code or misleading constructs observed. The code structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "Step 1: The script reads data from sources like user input or files. Step 2: It processes this data through functions that perform transformations, such as string manipulations or calculations. Step 3: Output is sent to standard output or written to files. No network calls, code injection points, or obfuscated constructs are detected. The code lacks malicious payloads or backdoors and adheres to common coding practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no evident malicious intent or security risks. It functions as a typical data processing script without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
