  "conclusion": "The dependency appears benign with no detected malicious or obfuscated code. The scores are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and minimal security risk scores reflecting the lack of suspicious activity. Minor adjustments could be made to lower the risk scores for reports without code, but current scores are acceptable. Overall, the supply chain security posture of this dependency is considered safe based on available analysis."
