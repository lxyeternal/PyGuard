{
  "purpose": "The code appears to verify Python version compatibility and import specific functions and variables from the 'pampy' package, likely for pattern matching or related functionalities.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info (reads Python version), import statements (load external modules and symbols from 'pampy')",
  "sinks": "Imported symbols (potential use in the code), sys.exit (can terminate program execution), import statements (may load malicious modules if compromised)",
  "flows": "sys.version_info → conditional checks → sys.exit, import statements → potential use of imported functions/variables",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names (e.g., CmkawQqERhayRLLuccxNiMEbOOCrEnCT, khJmdzXbnzltcoyoUAQMvVRQXGXDgCHT, etc.), unusual naming conventions, no clear comments or documentation, dependency on external 'pampy' package without context",
  "analysis": "The code checks Python version for compatibility, which is standard. The variable names are highly obfuscated, likely to conceal intent or hinder analysis. Import statements are from a well-known package 'pampy', which is used for pattern matching; these are legitimate functions but could be misused if exploited maliciously. No direct data handling, network activity, or dangerous commands are present. The obfuscation and lack of clarity are suspicious but not conclusive of malicious intent. The code itself does not perform malicious actions but is intentionally obscured, which warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily performs environment checks and imports functions from an external package with obfuscated identifiers. While it doesn't contain explicit malicious behavior, the obfuscation and lack of context raise suspicion. There is no evidence of malicious payloads such as data exfiltration, system modification, or network communication within this snippet. Overall, it appears benign but suspicious due to obfuscation.",
