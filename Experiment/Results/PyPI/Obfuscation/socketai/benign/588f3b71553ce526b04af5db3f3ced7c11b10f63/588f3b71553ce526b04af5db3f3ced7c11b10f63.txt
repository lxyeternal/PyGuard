      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits obfuscation and suspicious import patterns, notably the obfuscated class name and undefined version variable, which could be exploited to execute malicious code during import or setup. No concrete evidence of malicious activity is present, but the obfuscation and anomalies justify a moderate security concern. Further static or dynamic analysis of the 'pampy' package and the imported class is recommended before deployment."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be environment setup with heavy obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious activity in this snippet, but the obfuscation could be used to conceal malicious code elsewhere. The malware score is low (0.1), the obfuscated score is high (0.8), and the security risk is moderate (0.3), reflecting caution due to obfuscation but no active threats."

      "conclusion": "The code is a collection of introspection utilities with high obfuscation but no evidence of malicious activity. It is benign in isolation, though obfuscation could be exploited if integrated into larger malicious code. The malware score is correctly set to 0, and the obfuscation and risk scores reflect the code's nature. Overall, it is low risk but warrants caution due to obfuscation."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a sophisticated pattern validation and matching utility with significant obfuscation. There are no signs of malware or malicious activity, but the obfuscation and dynamic features could potentially be exploited. Overall, the security risk is low, with a very low likelihood of malicious intent."

      "conclusion": "The dependency appears benign with no detected malicious or obfuscated code. The scores are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and minimal security risk scores reflecting the lack of suspicious activity. Minor adjustments could be made to lower the risk scores for reports without code, but current scores are acceptable. Overall, the supply chain security posture of this dependency is considered safe based on available analysis."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign, primarily obfuscated test code for pattern matching functions. There is no evidence of supply chain attacks, malware, or malicious sabotage. The high obfuscation warrants caution but is not, in itself, malicious. Overall, the security risk is low, and the malware likelihood is negligible."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a sophisticated test suite with no explicit malicious activity. The primary security concern stems from the use of the 'khJmdzXbnzltcoyoUAQMvVRQXGXDgCHT' function, which is unknown and could be exploited if it evaluates untrusted input. The obfuscation and complex pattern matching increase suspicion but do not confirm malicious intent. Further review of the 'pampy' library's implementation and the specific function is recommended before deploying in sensitive environments."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate testing framework for a pattern matching function, with obfuscated naming and dynamic redefinition, but no evidence of malware or malicious activity. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to obfuscation, which warrants cautious review but does not imply malicious intent."

The primary concern is the external function, which warrants further investigation. Overall, the code should be treated with caution, with a malware score around 0.4, reflecting moderate suspicion due to obfuscation and unknown behavior."

The high obfuscation score reflects complexity but not malicious intent. The malware risk score is zero, and the overall security risk is low. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not indicate malicious behavior."
