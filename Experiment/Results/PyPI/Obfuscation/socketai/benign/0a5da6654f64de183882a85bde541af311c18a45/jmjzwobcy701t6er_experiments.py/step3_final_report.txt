  "purpose": "Scientific computations involving vibrational data, neutron scattering weights, and element properties, likely for materials analysis.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'vibration_info', 'select', and external data dictionaries; imported modules and class attributes.",
  "sinks": "In-memory calculations; no external network, file I/O, or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through functions and class methods, involving array manipulations and dictionary lookups, culminating in numerical results.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and class names, dynamic function calls, and complex data handling; no explicit malicious code or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code performs scientific calculations typical in physics or materials science, with obfuscation possibly for proprietary reasons. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system modification, or malicious payloads. The obfuscation and dynamic code patterns raise suspicion but are not definitive indicators of malicious intent. The data sources and sinks are internal, and no external communications are detected. The overall structure suggests legitimate scientific use, with obfuscation as the primary concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be scientific in nature, with obfuscation techniques that could be used to conceal malicious activity but no concrete evidence of such. The malware score is low, consistent with the absence of malicious indicators. The obfuscation score is moderate to high, reflecting the obfuscated identifiers and dynamic code patterns. The overall security risk is moderate, mainly due to obfuscation, but no active threats are evident.",
