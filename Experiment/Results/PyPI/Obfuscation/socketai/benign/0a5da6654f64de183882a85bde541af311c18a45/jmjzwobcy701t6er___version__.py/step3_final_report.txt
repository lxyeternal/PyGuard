{
  "purpose": "Assigns a version string \"1.8.4\" to an obfuscated variable name, likely representing a dependency version.",
  "sources": "N/A (no input or external data sources; static assignment).",
  "sinks": "N/A (no data flow, external communication, or data leaks).",
  "flows": "N/A (no source-to-sink data flow; static assignment only).",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable name; minimal code complexity; no malicious code or external interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static assignment of a version string to an obfuscated variable name. No input/output, data flow, or external communication is present. The variable name's obfuscation is typical in minified or auto-generated code but does not imply malicious intent. The assigned value appears to be a version number, indicating benign purpose. No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or sabotage are detected. The simplicity and static nature of the code suggest a low security risk.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is benign, representing a version assignment with obfuscated variable naming. There is no malicious activity, data leakage, or external communication. The obfuscation alone does not imply malicious intent, and the overall security posture is very low.",
