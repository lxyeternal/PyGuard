  "conclusion": "The import statement itself is benign and does not contain malicious behavior. The primary risk lies in the external module's content, which cannot be assessed here. The use of 'import *' is discouraged but not malicious. Overall, the code poses minimal security threat, with a very low risk score justified by external dependency considerations."
