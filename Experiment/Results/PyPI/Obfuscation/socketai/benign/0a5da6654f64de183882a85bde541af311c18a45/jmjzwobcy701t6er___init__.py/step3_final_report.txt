  "purpose": "Import all functions and objects from the 'spin_phonon_suite.cli' module, potentially to use its functionalities.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no data input sources are present in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows are present in this code snippet; it only imports modules.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths are identifiable from this single import statement.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' which can obscure imported names and hinder security analysis; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement importing all symbols from an external module. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior is evident in this line. The main concern is the external dependency's trustworthiness and the use of 'import *', which reduces code clarity and maintainability but does not inherently pose a security risk. The scores should reflect the benign nature of the code, with a slight concern due to external dependency and wildcard import practices.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement itself is benign and does not contain malicious behavior. The primary risk lies in the external module's content, which cannot be assessed here. The use of 'import *' is discouraged but not malicious. Overall, the code poses minimal security threat, with a very low risk score justified by external dependency considerations.",
