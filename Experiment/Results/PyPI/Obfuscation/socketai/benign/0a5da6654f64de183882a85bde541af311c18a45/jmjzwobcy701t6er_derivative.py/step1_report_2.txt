{
  "purpose": "The code reads vibration data from a text file, processes it, and writes formatted output to a file.",
  "sources": "Input file read operations (open and read lines), reading specific lines containing 'Vibration:', parsing float values from lines.",
  "sinks": "Write operations to an output file (f_name), including formatted data entries.",
  "flows": "Data is read from a file, stored in variables, then processed and written to the output file in a structured format.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains dynamic file reading and writing, but no hardcoded credentials, suspicious network calls, or obfuscated logic. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions: one for parsing and processing vibration data from a file, and another for reading the same data. The first function writes formatted data, including vibrational energy and derivatives, to a file. The second function reads lines, extracting specific float values, and constructs arrays. No obfuscated code, no suspicious imports or network activity, and no code injections are present. The overall purpose appears to be data processing without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs data reading and writing for vibration analysis, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It operates within typical data processing boundaries, and no malicious signals are detected.",
