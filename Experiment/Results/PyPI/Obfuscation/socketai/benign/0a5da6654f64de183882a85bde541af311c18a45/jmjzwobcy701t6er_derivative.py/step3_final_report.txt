{
  "purpose": "Processes vibrational energy data and derivatives, reading from and writing to files in a structured format.",
  "sources": "Lines containing 'Vibration:' and subsequent lines with derivative values, read from input files.",
  "sinks": "Formatted output written to specified files; no untrusted data flow beyond file I/O.",
  "flows": "Input lines with 'Vibration:' → parsing of energy and derivatives → formatted data written to output file.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are obfuscated, but no malicious patterns, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard scientific data parsing and formatting. It reads specific lines, extracts float values, and writes formatted output. No network activity, external command execution, or credential handling is present. Variable obfuscation is superficial and not indicative of malicious intent. The logic is straightforward, with no error handling, but this does not introduce security risks. Overall, the code appears legitimate, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain compromise.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical scientific data parser and formatter with superficial variable obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. The low malware and risk scores are justified, and the obfuscation score reflects variable naming but not malicious intent.",
