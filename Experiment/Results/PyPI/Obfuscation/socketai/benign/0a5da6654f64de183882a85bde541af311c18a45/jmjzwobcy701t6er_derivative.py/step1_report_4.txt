{
  "purpose": "The code reads vibration and energy data from a file, processes it, and writes formatted output to another file, likely for spectral or vibrational analysis.",
  "sources": "Reading from a file specified by f_name; extracting data lines containing 'Vibration:'; parsing float values from lines.",
  "sinks": "Writing to a file specified by f_name; outputting formatted numerical data and headers.",
  "flows": "Data is read from the input file (source), processed into numerical arrays, and then formatted and written to the output file (sink).",
  "anomalies": "The code performs no network activity, credential handling, or obfuscated operations. It has repetitive, straightforward file I/O and data processing without suspicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code contains two functions: one for reading and parsing data from a file into numpy arrays, and another for writing processed data back to a file. The reading function searches for lines containing 'Vibration:', extracts specific float values, and appends parsed data into lists which are converted to numpy arrays. The writing function formats and writes descriptive headers and numerical data. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The operations are standard data I/O and formatting routines. The code does not use dynamic code execution or obfuscation. It appears to be a legitimate data processing script with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data parsing and formatting script with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or suspicious anomalies. It appears to be a legitimate utility for processing vibrational data.",
