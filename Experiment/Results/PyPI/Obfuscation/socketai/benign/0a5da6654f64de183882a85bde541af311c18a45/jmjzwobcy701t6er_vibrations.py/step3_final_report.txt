{
  "purpose": "The code implements scientific routines for vibrational and phonon analysis, structure manipulation, and eigenvalue problems, primarily using external scientific libraries and complex mathematical operations.",
  "sources": "File I/O operations such as reading/writing HDF5 datasets, parsing OUTCAR and POSCAR files, and loading external data via libraries like phonopy, pymatgen, and scipy.",
  "sinks": "Data outputs to HDF5 files, text files, and arrays; no network connections, system commands, or external communication routines detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external files into arrays and objects, processed through mathematical and eigenvalue computations, then exported back to files or returned as objects.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of highly obfuscated variable names and large numerical constants, which are typical in physics simulations but could be mistaken for malicious obfuscation; no suspicious code injections or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of scientific routines with complex variable naming and constants, consistent with proprietary physics simulation software. No network, system commands, or malicious payloads are present. Obfuscation appears intentional for IP protection rather than malicious intent. Data flows are standard for scientific computation, with no signs of sabotage or data exfiltration. The high obfuscation score (0.7) reflects the variable naming complexity, while malware score remains at 0 due to the absence of malicious behaviors. The overall security risk is low (0.2).",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate scientific software with significant obfuscation likely for proprietary reasons. No malicious activity, sabotage, or malicious data handling is evident. The assigned scores are consistent with the analysis, indicating a low security threat.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.7,
