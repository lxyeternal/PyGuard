      "obfuscated": 0.8,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code functions as a legitimate file indexing and monitoring utility. The heavy obfuscation is suspicious but not evidence of malware. No malicious activity such as network communication or sabotage is detected. The assigned low malware scores are justified. Continued monitoring and static analysis are recommended if used in sensitive environments."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign, representing a straightforward assignment of a version string to an obfuscated variable. There is no evidence of malicious activity, data exfiltration, or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation is likely for internal or auto-generated purposes and does not indicate malicious intent. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is a standard file and content management implementation with superficial obfuscation. There are no signs of malware, sabotage, or malicious behavior. The primary concern is unvalidated path inputs, which should be addressed for security best practices, but this does not indicate malicious intent."

      "conclusion": "The code does not show explicit malicious activity but uses obfuscation that warrants caution. Without further insight into the behavior of the imported function, the risk remains moderate. The current scores reflect suspicion due to obfuscation but lack concrete evidence of malware."
