  "conclusion": "The code functions as a legitimate file indexing and monitoring utility. The heavy obfuscation is suspicious but not evidence of malware. No malicious activity such as network communication or sabotage is detected. The assigned low malware scores are justified. Continued monitoring and static analysis are recommended if used in sensitive environments."
