  "sources": "Assignment statement reading a constant string value.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; this is a simple variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable name; no other anomalies or suspicious code behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single line assigning a static string '0.7.8' to a variable with a non-descriptive, obfuscated name. There are no inputs, no external data sources, no network communications, and no complex logic. The code appears to be a version or configuration string assignment, common in many packages. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, representing a straightforward assignment of a version string to an obfuscated variable name. No malicious intent or security risks are detected.",
