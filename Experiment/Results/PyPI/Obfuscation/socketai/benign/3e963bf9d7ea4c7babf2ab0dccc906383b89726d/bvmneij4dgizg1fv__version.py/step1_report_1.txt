  "purpose": "Store and format user data including name, email, flags, and timestamp.",
  "sources": "Variables assigned at the beginning (e.g., string assignments, tuple creation). No external input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data is written to files, network, or external systems.",
  "flows": "Data assigned to variables, then a tuple is created and used in string formatting to produce a formatted timestamp string.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code simply manipulates data locally.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several variables, including a name, email, some numeric flags, and a timestamp string. It then creates a tuple from some of these variables and formats a string with the tuple elements. There are no functions, external input, or external output mechanisms. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be straightforward data storage and formatting without any malicious intent or security risks.",
