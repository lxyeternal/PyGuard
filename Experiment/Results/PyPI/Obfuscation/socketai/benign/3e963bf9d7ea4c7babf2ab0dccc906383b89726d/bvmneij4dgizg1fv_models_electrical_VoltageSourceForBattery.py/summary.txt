  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code is an obfuscated but benign simulation component that updates voltage based on current and soc inputs. There is no evidence of malware, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not imply malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
