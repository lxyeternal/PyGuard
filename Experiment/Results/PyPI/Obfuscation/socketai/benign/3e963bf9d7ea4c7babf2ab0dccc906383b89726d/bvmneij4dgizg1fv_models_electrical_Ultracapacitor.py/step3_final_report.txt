  "purpose": "Simulation model managing electrical parameters such as voltage, current, and state of charge for a battery or capacitor component.",
  "sources": "Reads 'current' from input dictionary; imports obfuscated modules and classes for modeling components.",
  "sinks": "Updates internal voltage, current, and SOC; raises exception if 'current' is missing; no external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input 'current' influences voltage and SOC calculations; internal state updates based on inputs.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of class, method, variable, and module names; no hardcoded secrets, network calls, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a simulation component for electrical parameters with safety checks and exception handling. Obfuscation is prominent but appears to serve proprietary concealment rather than malicious intent. No evidence of data exfiltration, network activity, or system modification is present. The input validation is standard, and the logic manages voltage, current, and SOC appropriately.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, heavily obfuscated simulation module modeling electrical components. No malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities are evident. The high obfuscation score is justified, and no active threats are detected. The supply chain security risk remains low.",
