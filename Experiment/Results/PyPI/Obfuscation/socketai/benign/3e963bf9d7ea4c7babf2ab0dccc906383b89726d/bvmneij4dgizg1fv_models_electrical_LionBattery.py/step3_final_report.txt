  "purpose": "Modeling a battery or electrical system with simulation methods for state of charge and voltage updates.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'current', 'step', 'soc', 'ocv', 'r', and 'parameters' used within methods.",
  "sinks": "Internal state updates; no external data leaks or network activity detected.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., 'current', 'step') flows into calculations for voltage, state of charge, and temperature updates.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code; no external communication.",
  "analysis": "The code is heavily obfuscated but structurally consistent with a simulation model for a battery or electrical system. It reads input parameters, updates internal states, and performs calculations without external data leaks or network activity. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The obfuscation appears to serve proprietary or concealment purposes rather than malicious intent. The logic is standard for such models, involving input validation, state updates, and parameter calculations. The high obfuscation scores across reports are justified, but they do not indicate malicious behavior. The malware score remains at 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2), reflecting the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, obfuscated simulation component modeling battery behavior. No evidence of malicious activity or security risks is present. Obfuscation likely for proprietary reasons rather than malicious intent. The overall security assessment is low risk, with high obfuscation but no malicious indicators.",
