{
  "purpose": "The code defines a decorator function that logs a deprecation warning when a function is called.",
  "sources": "The code reads the function name (__name__) and logs a message via vTEVSEyBDiqTiKOUojQQnXPZMnueFhgu.critical.",
  "sinks": "The sink is the logging function call, which outputs a message indicating deprecation.",
  "flows": "When a decorated function is invoked, the function name is retrieved and logged, then the original function is called.",
  "anomalies": "The logger variable name appears obfuscated, but it is used solely for logging. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code are present. No unusual dynamic code execution or hidden behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a logger object with an obfuscated name, then defines a decorator that logs a deprecation message every time the decorated function is invoked. The pattern is standard for deprecation warnings. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The obfuscated logger name is suspicious but not inherently malicious; it may be an attempt to evade detection or obfuscate intent. Overall, the code appears to serve a benign purpose related to deprecation notices, with no malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard deprecation warning decorator that logs function calls. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
