{
  "purpose": "The code defines a decorator function that logs a deprecation warning when a decorated function is called.",
  "sources": "The source is the decorator function 'eSXNdEqMlBQBCwEkcjQaVDSexctZhKMU', which wraps any target function, and the imported logger 'vTEVSEyBDiqTiKOUojQQnXPZMnueFhgu'.",
  "sinks": "The critical logging call within the wrapper function logs to 'vTEVSEyBDiqTiKOUojQQnXPZMnueFhgu', but does not leak data or perform other sensitive actions.",
  "flows": "The source is the invocation of the decorator; the flow is the call to the wrapped function, which triggers a log message indicating deprecation.",
  "anomalies": "The logger object 'vTEVSEyBDiqTiKOUojQQnXPZMnueFhgu' is obfuscated, and the function name 'eSXNdEqMlBQBCwEkcjQaVDSexctZhKMU' is also obfuscated, which may suggest an attempt to hide intent. However, the code itself only logs a message and does not perform any malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a logger and defines a decorator that logs a deprecation warning when a function is called. The logger object is obfuscated, but the usage is straightforward. There are no signs of data leakage, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The code simply warns users about deprecation, which is a common practice. The obfuscation could be for hiding internal logic but does not inherently indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard deprecation warning decorator with obfuscated names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The only notable aspect is obfuscation, which may hinder understanding but does not imply harm.",
