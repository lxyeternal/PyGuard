  "purpose": "Manage and verify software versioning through reading, writing, and updating a configuration file",
  "sources": "Reading version data from the file 'VERSION_LOCK.ini', reading user input via input()",
  "sinks": "File write operations, file delete operations, user input, potential program termination via sys.exit()",
  "flows": "Read version data from file -> compare with input version -> warn or update version -> possibly delete or overwrite config file",
  "anomalies": "Uses input() for user confirmation, which is standard; no suspicious hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code; no network or system-level malicious actions observed",
  "analysis": "The code appears to implement version management functions with validation, comparison, and update capabilities. It reads configuration data from a file, writes updates, and prompts the user for confirmation before proceeding if versions match or differ. No code injection, network activity, or data exfiltration routines are present. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are detected. The use of input() suggests interactive usage, not malicious intent. The only potential security concern is the reliance on user input for flow control, which is typical for configuration management but does not indicate malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version management utility with no evident malicious behavior or supply chain threats. It performs file operations, version validation, and user prompts in a normal manner, with no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
