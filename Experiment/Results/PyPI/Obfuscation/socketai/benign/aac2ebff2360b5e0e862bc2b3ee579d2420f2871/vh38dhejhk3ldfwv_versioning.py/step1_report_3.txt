  "purpose": "Manage and verify software versioning using configuration files and user prompts.",
  "sources": "Reading version data from 'VERSION_LOCK.ini' file; reading input from user prompts; reading from and writing to configuration files.",
  "sinks": "File operations (read/write/ delete) involving the version configuration file; user input via input() for build confirmation.",
  "flows": "Source: Reading version data from file and user input → Sink: Writing version info to file, deleting files, and exiting process based on input and version comparisons.",
  "anomalies": "Use of input() for build confirmation could be exploited for denial of service or misbehavior if automated scripts interfere; no hardcoded credentials or obvious backdoors. The code involves user prompts which are normal but can be misused in malicious contexts. No network activity or external data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code reads version information from a config file, compares it with a provided version string, and prompts the user for confirmation if the current version equals or exceeds the last-built version. It performs file existence checks, reading, writing, and deletion operations on a configuration file. The user prompt for continuing builds could be manipulated to cause delays or halt processes, but it does not exhibit malicious intent like data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious obfuscated code are present. The code's main concern is version management with user confirmation, which is standard practice in build systems.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily focused on version management, with no clear malicious behavior detected. The user prompts could be misused in an attack scenario to cause inconvenience or denial of service but do not constitute malicious code per se. No malware or security risks are evident beyond normal application logic.",
