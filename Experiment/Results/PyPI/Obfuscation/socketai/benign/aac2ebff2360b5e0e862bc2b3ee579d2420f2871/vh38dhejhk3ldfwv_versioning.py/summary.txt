  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate version management utility with superficial obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. The obfuscation appears to be for concealment rather than malicious intent. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score should remain at 0. The obfuscation score is high but justified given the variable naming. Overall, the code poses no supply chain security threat."
