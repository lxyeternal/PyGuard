  "purpose": "Set up logging configuration with a custom formatter and stream handler",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or untrusted data; it only initializes logging objects and configurations",
  "targets": "The code does not send data to external systems, files, or network locations; it only configures logging",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Variables are assigned non-descriptive, seemingly random names; however, this alone does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the logging module, creates a Logger object, a Formatter object, and a StreamHandler, then configures the handler's level and formatter before attaching it to the logger. All steps are consistent with standard logging setup in Python. Variable names are obfuscated but do not by themselves imply malicious intent. There is no evidence of data exfiltration, network activity, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate logging setup with obfuscated variable names. There are no signs of malicious activity or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
