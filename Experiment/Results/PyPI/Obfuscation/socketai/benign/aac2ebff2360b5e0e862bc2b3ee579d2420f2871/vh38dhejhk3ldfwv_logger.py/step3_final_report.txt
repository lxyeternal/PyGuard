  "purpose": "Configure a Python logger with detailed formatting and stream output.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it sets up internal logging components.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or outputs that could lead to data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code only configures logging components internally.",
  "anomalies": "Use of heavily obfuscated variable names; no malicious code or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard logging setup: creates a logger, formatter, stream handler, sets levels, and attaches the formatter. Variable names are obfuscated but this does not imply malicious intent. No external data handling, network activity, or malicious payloads are present. The obfuscation appears to be solely for obscuring variable names, not for malicious purposes. The code is syntactically correct and follows typical logging configuration practices. Scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0.8, risk=0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No evidence suggests malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard logging configuration with obfuscated variable names. It does not contain malware or security vulnerabilities. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
