  "sources": "logging module import, logging.Logger, logging.Formatter, logging.StreamHandler, method calls to setLevel and setFormatter, addHandler",
  "sinks": "None identified; code configures logging but does not perform any data transmission or sensitive operations",
  "flows": "Import logging -> create logger -> create formatter -> create stream handler -> set level and formatter -> add handler to logger",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious variables or code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic present",
  "analysis": "The code imports the logging module and creates a logger object with a custom formatter and stream handler for debugging. All steps follow standard logging setup procedures without any obfuscated or suspicious constructs. No external data, user input, or untrusted sources are involved, and no data is transmitted or stored maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply sets up a logging configuration for debugging purposes. There is no indication of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
