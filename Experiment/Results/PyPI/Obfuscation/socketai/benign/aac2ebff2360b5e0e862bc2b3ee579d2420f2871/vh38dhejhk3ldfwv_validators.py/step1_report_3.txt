  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for validating version lists, app names, bundle identifiers, directory paths, file paths, architectures, and log levels.",
  "sources": "User inputs such as version list, name, identifier, path, type, architecture, and log level; also data retrieved via os.path functions.",
  "sinks": "Logging calls that output validation results; potential data leaks if sensitive data is logged (though unlikely here); filesystem checks.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are validated through regex, type, or existence checks, then logged; no untrusted data flows into dangerous system commands or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors observed. Logging of all validation results is standard. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution found. All validation routines are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly performs validation of input data using regex matching, type checking, and filesystem checks. Logging is used to record validation outcomes. No execution of untrusted code, no network activity, and no storage or transmission of sensitive data is evident. The code appears to be standard validation logic with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The imported modules seem to be standard or project-specific logging and helpers, with no evidence of hidden or malicious code. All operations are benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of input validation functions with no malicious intent or security risks. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The validation and logging are standard and do not indicate supply chain threats.",
