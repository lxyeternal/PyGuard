  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class named NYuIHCKAnYdQOIjzYmwssDZuzqwQbXkV.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading sources present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output sinks present.",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow or input/output operations.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual class name that appears obfuscated or intentionally obscure; no other suspicious code elements.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single custom exception class with an obfuscated name. It inherits from Python's built-in Exception class and properly initializes with a message and optional arguments. There are no external data sources, sinks, or data flow paths. The class implementation is straightforward and does not perform any malicious actions, data handling, or system modifications. The obscured class name may suggest an attempt to hide intent, but there is no active malicious behavior or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign definition of a custom exception class with an obfuscated name. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or unusual activity.",
