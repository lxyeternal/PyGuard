  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class named NYuIHCKAnYdQOIjzYmwssDZuzqwQbXkV",
  "sources": "Class definition and the __init__ method, which accept a message and optional arguments",
  "sinks": "super().__init__() call, which initializes the base Exception with provided arguments",
  "flows": "Input message and args flow into Exception initialization via super().__init__()",
  "anomalies": "The class name is a nonsensical, random string; no meaningful purpose indicated. No suspicious code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class with a randomly generated name, inheriting from Exception. The constructor passes the message and any additional arguments to the base Exception class. No external data sources, network activity, or malicious behaviors are present. The code appears to be straightforward and benign, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a simple, benign custom exception class with a nonsensical name. No malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious activity are detected.",
