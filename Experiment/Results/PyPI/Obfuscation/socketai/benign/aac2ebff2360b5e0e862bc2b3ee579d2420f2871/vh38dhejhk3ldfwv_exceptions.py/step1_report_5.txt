{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class with an obfuscated name for handling specific errors.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling detected.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "The class name appears intentionally obfuscated and does not convey meaningful purpose; no other suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with a non-descriptive, obfuscated name that inherits from Exception. The constructor simply calls the superclass constructor with a message and optional arguments. There are no external data inputs, no network activity, no code injection, or suspicious operations. The obfuscated class name may indicate an attempt to hide intent, but the code itself is straightforward and not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely defines an obfuscated exception class with no malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscated name alone does not indicate harmful intent, and the implementation is standard.",
