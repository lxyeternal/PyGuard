  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources present",
  "sinks": "No data output or external system interaction points present",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; class definition has no runtime data processing",
  "anomalies": "Class name appears to be a random string, indicating obfuscation or lack of clarity; no meaningful purpose apparent",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of Exception with a non-descriptive, seemingly random name. It includes an __init__ method that forwards its message and additional arguments to the parent Exception class. There are no external inputs, no data leaks, no malicious behavior, no system calls, and no suspicious logic. The unusual class name might suggest obfuscation, but it alone does not imply malicious intent.\n\nOverall, the code is a straightforward custom exception class with no evidence of malicious activity or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple custom exception class with an obscure name. It does not perform any malicious actions, data leakage, or insecure operations. Its primary concern is clarity and intent, which are lacking due to the random class name, but this does not introduce security risks.",
