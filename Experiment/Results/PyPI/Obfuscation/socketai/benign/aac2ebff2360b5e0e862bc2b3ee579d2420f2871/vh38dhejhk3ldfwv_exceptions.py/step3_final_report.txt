  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class with an obfuscated name.",
  "sources": "Class instantiation and inheritance from Exception; constructor forwarding message and args.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, network, or system calls.",
  "flows": "Class creation and instantiation; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class name; no functional anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class inheriting from Exception with a nonsensical name, serving as a custom exception. It contains no malicious logic, external data handling, or system interaction. The obfuscated name suggests obfuscation but does not imply malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, with scores reflecting high obfuscation but no malware or security risks. The code's simplicity and lack of external effects confirm its benign status.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated custom exception class with no malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation score is justified, but malware and risk scores should remain at 0 and 0.1 respectively, consistent with the reports. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
