  "conclusion": "The code functions as a legitimate utility for building and executing packaging commands, with proper validation steps in place. While obfuscation and dynamic command construction introduce some risk, there is no evidence of malicious behavior. The main security consideration is ensuring the validation functions are robust enough to prevent injection or invalid inputs. The malware score is appropriately zero, and the obfuscation and risk scores are justified given the context."
