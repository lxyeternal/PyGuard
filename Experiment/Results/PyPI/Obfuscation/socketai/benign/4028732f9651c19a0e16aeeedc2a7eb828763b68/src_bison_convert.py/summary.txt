  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate and straightforward parser generator tool that reads grammar and lex files, processes their content, and outputs a Python parser module. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious routines. The primary security consideration is ensuring the input files are from trusted sources to prevent malicious code generation. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the static analysis and the code's behavior."
