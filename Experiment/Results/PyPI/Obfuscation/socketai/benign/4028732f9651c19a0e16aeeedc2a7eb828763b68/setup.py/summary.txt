  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, platform-aware setup script for a Python package involving Cython extensions. No evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities is present. The obfuscation appears superficial and typical for generated or protected code. The assigned malware and risk scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
