{
  "purpose": "The code processes a file specified as a command-line argument, reading and analyzing lines that contain mappings, and printing certain lines based on lookup conditions.",
  "sources": "The code reads a filename from command-line arguments and then reads the entire content of this file line by line.",
  "sinks": "The code reads files based on dynamic filenames derived from the input data; it also prints specific lines to standard output.",
  "flows": "Input filename -> read file content -> process lines with pattern ' ==> ' -> lookups in other files -> print matched lines",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic filename reading and reading files based on input data could be exploited if input data is malicious; no validation or sanitization of filenames or input data is present. The code reads and outputs data without any filtering or encryption. It loads entire files into memory repeatedly, which could be inefficient but not necessarily malicious. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code reads a filename from the command line, then processes its lines to find lines containing ' ==> '. For such lines, it extracts parts of the line to determine filenames and line numbers. It reads these files' contents into memory and then outputs specific lines based on the parsed data. The use of input data to determine filenames for reading, combined with no sanitization, could allow for malicious input to cause unauthorized file access or information leakage. The code also prints lines directly, which might lead to information disclosure if sensitive files are processed. There are no signs of code injection, backdoors, or network activity. No suspicious external dependencies or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to perform intended file processing operations without explicit malicious intent, but its handling of filenames derived from untrusted input poses a security risk for file access or information leakage. It does not contain malware or obfuscated code but warrants caution due to input-based file access.",
