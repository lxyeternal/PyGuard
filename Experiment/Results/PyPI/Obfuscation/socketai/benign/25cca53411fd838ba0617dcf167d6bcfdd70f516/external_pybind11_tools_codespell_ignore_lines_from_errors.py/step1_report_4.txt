  "purpose": "Process a file containing lines with mappings, read specific lines from other files based on these mappings, and print certain lines to the output.",
  "sources": "Input filename from command line argument; read lines from files whose names are derived from the input file.",
  "sinks": "Print statements outputting lines read from files based on mappings; file read operations accessing potentially untrusted files.",
  "flows": "Read lines from a file specified in command line argument -> Parse each line for indices -> Access other files based on parsed data -> Read specific lines from those files -> Print these lines.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic file access based on input data without validation; multiple file reads that depend on the content of the input file; no validation on filenames or indices; potential multiple file reads which could be exploited.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a filename from the command line argument, then processes each line of that file. For each line, it searches for a pattern (' ==> '), then extracts a filename and an index. It reads the target file only once per filename, caching the lines. It then retrieves a specific line from the cached file based on the index and prints it if not already printed. The code involves dynamic file access and printing data based on external input, but does not execute code or contain obvious backdoors. No hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads are present. Potential risks include reading arbitrary files based on input data, but there's no evidence of malicious intent beyond normal file processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs file processing and selective printing based on input data, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The main concern is the potential for reading arbitrary files specified in input, which could be misused in a broader context, but no malicious code or malware is evident.",
