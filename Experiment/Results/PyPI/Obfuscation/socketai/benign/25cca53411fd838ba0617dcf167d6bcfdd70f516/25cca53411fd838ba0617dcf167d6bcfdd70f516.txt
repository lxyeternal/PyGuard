      "security_risk": 0.3,
      "obfuscated": 0.65,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code appears benign in its current form, performing standard setup tasks. The suspicious, unused obfuscated variable and package name warrant caution but do not confirm malicious activity. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscation is moderate, and overall security risk is low. Further review of the full codebase is advised to ensure no malicious payloads are hidden."

      "obfuscated": 0,
      "confidence": 0.7,
      "conclusion": "The import statement is benign in isolation, with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary concern is the use of a wildcard import from an internal module, which could conceal malicious functions, but no such functions are demonstrated here. Overall, the security risk is minimal, and the malware likelihood is effectively zero."

      "obfuscated": 0.2,
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for extracting specific lines from files based on input mappings. While it does not contain malware or obfuscation, its lack of input validation introduces moderate security considerations, mainly the risk of reading unintended files if input is malicious. The overall assessment aligns with the provided reports, with malware score 0, obfuscated score approximately 0.2, and risk score around 0.3."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The script is a benign file size monitoring utility with obfuscated variable names and some coding flaws. There is no evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious activity. The high obfuscation score reflects the variable naming but does not imply malicious intent. Overall, the security risk is low, primarily due to poor coding practices rather than malicious actions."

      "conclusion": "The code snippet is a benign changelog parser fragment with obfuscated variable naming. No malicious activity or security threats are evident. The high obfuscation score is justified, but the malware score remains at zero due to lack of malicious behavior. The overall security risk is low."
