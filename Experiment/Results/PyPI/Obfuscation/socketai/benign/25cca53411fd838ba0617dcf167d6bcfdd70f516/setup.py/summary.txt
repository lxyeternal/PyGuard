  "conclusion": "The code appears benign in its current form, performing standard setup tasks. The suspicious, unused obfuscated variable and package name warrant caution but do not confirm malicious activity. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscation is moderate, and overall security risk is low. Further review of the full codebase is advised to ensure no malicious payloads are hidden."
