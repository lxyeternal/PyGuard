  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The code is a simple wildcard import. No malicious activity is evident. The concern is mainly about code clarity, not security.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.3\n- **Evaluation:** The low malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate. The security risk is minimal, given the limited context.\n- **Conclusion:** No change needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, with slightly higher confidence. The wildcard import raises concerns about hidden functions, but no malicious activity is demonstrated.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.3, confidence=0.6\n- **Evaluation:** The risk score is reasonable, considering the potential for hidden functions. Malware remains at zero, which aligns with the evidence.\n- **Conclusion:** No change needed.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** The import from an internal module. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, confidence=0.2\n- **Evaluation:** The very low risk score is appropriate. The low confidence reflects the minimal information.\n- **Conclusion:** No change needed.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous reports, importing from a private/internal module with no evident malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, confidence=0.6\n- **Evaluation:** Appropriate given the context.\n- **Conclusion:** No change needed.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, a straightforward import with no further context.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, confidence=0.6\n- **Evaluation:** Correctly reflects the low risk and no malware suspicion.\n- **Conclusion:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, consistent with the straightforward import statements.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slight variation, but generally low, reflecting the minimal code snippet and lack of context.\n- **Confidence Scores:** Varying but generally low to moderate, appropriate given the limited information.\n\n### Final Assessment:\nBased on all reports, the actual risk appears minimal. The only potential concern is the use of wildcard imports, which can obscure code behavior but do not inherently imply malicious intent.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to reflect the concern about import style, but overall very low)\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent with my analysis. No evidence of malware or obfuscation, and the risk remains low.",
