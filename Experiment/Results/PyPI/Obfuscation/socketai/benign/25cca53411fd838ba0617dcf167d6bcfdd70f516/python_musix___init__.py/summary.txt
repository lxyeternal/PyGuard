  "conclusion": "The import statement is benign in isolation, with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary concern is the use of a wildcard import from an internal module, which could conceal malicious functions, but no such functions are demonstrated here. Overall, the security risk is minimal, and the malware likelihood is effectively zero."
