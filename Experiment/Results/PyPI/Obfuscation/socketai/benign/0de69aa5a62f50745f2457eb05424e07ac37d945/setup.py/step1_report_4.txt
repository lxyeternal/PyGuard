{
  "purpose": "The code is configuring package data for a Python package using setuptools, specifying stub files and metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package data definitions for 'package_data' in the setup() function call.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks; the code only specifies static data for packaging.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; this is a static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and typical for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and calls setup() with a static dictionary defining package data for two packages, 'dateparser-stubs' and 'dateparser_data-stubs'. There are no dynamic inputs, code execution, or external data dependencies. No indications of obfuscation, malicious intent, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign package configuration script used to specify static data files for distribution. It does not contain any malicious code, obfuscation, or security risks.",
