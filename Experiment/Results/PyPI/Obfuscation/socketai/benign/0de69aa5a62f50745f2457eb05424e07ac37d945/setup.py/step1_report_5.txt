{
  "purpose": "The code configures package data for a Python package named 'dateparser-stubs' and 'dateparser_data-stubs' using setuptools.setup.",
  "sources": "The source of data includes the package_data dictionary containing file paths for .pyi and .toml files.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or perform potentially dangerous operations.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks, as the code solely defines package data.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a straightforward setup configuration with no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setup' from setuptools and calls it with a static dictionary specifying package data files. The file list includes type stub files (.pyi) and metadata files (.toml, .typed). No dynamic code execution, input reading, or data processing occurs. The structure is standard for package configuration. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup configuration snippet for defining package data. There are no malicious or security-related issues detected.",
