{
  "purpose": "This code is setting up package data for a Python project, specifically defining data files for the 'dateparser-stubs' and 'dateparser_data-stubs' packages.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data files (e.g., __init__.pyi, *.pyi, METADATA.toml, py.typed) from specified directories.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; no untrusted data processing or output operations are observed.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code only specifies static package data files.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are present. The code appears to be a standard setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setup' from setuptools and invokes it with a dictionary specifying package data. The data includes multiple .pyi stub files and metadata files for two packages. There are no input streams, no processing logic, no network operations, or dynamic code execution. The code appears straightforward, standard, and safe, primarily used for package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is a typical configuration for including package data files and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard, benign package setup configuration.",
