{
  "purpose": "The code is configuring package data for the 'dateparser-stubs' and 'dateparser_data-stubs' packages using setuptools.setup()",
  "sources": "The data is read from the 'setup()' function arguments, specifically the 'package_data' parameter",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network connections, file writes, or external system calls are present",
  "flows": "Data flows from the static package data definitions into the packaging system during setup; no runtime data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code appears to be standard package configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward call to 'setup()' from setuptools, defining package data for distribution. No dynamic execution, no input handling, and no suspicious code patterns are present. It strictly serves to specify static package metadata.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical package setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and solely intended for packaging purposes.",
