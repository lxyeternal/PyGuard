{
  "purpose": "To include package data files in a Python package distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads package data files specified in the 'package_data' dictionary, which includes various '.pyi' stub files and metadata files.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or external system calls are present in this code.",
  "flows": "The code primarily configures package data without any data flow from untrusted sources; there are no source-to-sink flows related to untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior; the code appears straightforward and standard for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'setup' function from 'setuptools' and calls it with a 'package_data' argument that specifies the inclusion of various stub and metadata files for the 'dateparser-stubs' and 'dateparser_data-stubs' packages. No dynamic code execution, external data input, or suspicious patterns are observed. It is a typical package setup configuration aimed at distributing static files, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration for including package data files in a Python package. There are no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears safe and aligned with common packaging practices.",
