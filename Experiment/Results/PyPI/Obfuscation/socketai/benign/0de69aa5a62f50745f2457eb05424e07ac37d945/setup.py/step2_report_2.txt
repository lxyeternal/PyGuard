  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as a standard setup script for including static package data files.\n- No reports identify any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The code only specifies static data files (e.g., .pyi, .toml, .typed) for distribution.\n- No untrusted data input, dynamic code execution, network operations, or external dependencies are involved.\n\n**Confirming the code's presence and behavior:**\n- The code imports 'setup' from 'setuptools' and calls it with a 'package_data' dictionary.\n- The data files listed are all static, known to be used for type stubs and metadata.\n- The structure and content are typical for package distribution.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**\n- No errors or flaws are apparent in the code.\n- The logic is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns or anomalies.\n- The reports correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n\n**Scores and their justification:**\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is appropriate.\n- Confidence levels are 1, reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n- No adjustments are necessary; the scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:**\n- The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as static package configuration.\n- There are no claims of hidden malicious behavior, and none is evident.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is a typical setup script for including package data files.\n- There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and justified.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary:**\nThis is a standard, benign package setup configuration with no security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's nature.",
