  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward setup script configuring static package data files.\n   - The code only imports `setup` from `setuptools` and calls it with a `package_data` dictionary, listing various `.pyi`, `.toml`, and `.typed` files.\n   - There are no dynamic data flows, no input handling, no network or file operations beyond static inclusion, and no suspicious code patterns.\n   - **Conclusion:** The code appears benign and standard for package distribution. No issues are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n   - They correctly identify the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign `malware` scores of 0, `securityRisk` scores of 0, and `obfuscated` scores of 0.\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports and the code itself show no malicious intent or security issues, risk scores should remain at 0.\n   - Any higher score would be unjustified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n   - The malware score of 0 across all reports is correct.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports base their conclusions on static analysis, which is appropriate.\n   - No assumptions about hidden malicious behavior are made; the analysis is conservative and accurate.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis provided.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is a typical setup script for including static package data files. It does not process untrusted data, does not perform any dynamic operations, and contains no suspicious or malicious content. The reports are accurate and appropriately score the security aspects.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis is a benign, standard package setup configuration with no security concerns.",
