{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a setup script for including static package data files in a Python package distribution, specifically listing stub files and metadata for 'dateparser-stubs' and 'dateparser_data-stubs'.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it solely defines static data files within the setup() call.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or system effects, as the code does not process untrusted input or execute dynamic code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only specifies static package data without any runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The code is straightforward and standard for package configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setup' from 'setuptools' and calls it with a 'package_data' dictionary listing static files ('.pyi', '.toml', '.typed') for two packages. It contains no dynamic operations, user input, network calls, or code execution. All files are static, known for type hints and metadata. The code is a typical setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. The reports correctly identify it as benign, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. There are no anomalies or security concerns, and the code does not process untrusted data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static package configuration script with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
