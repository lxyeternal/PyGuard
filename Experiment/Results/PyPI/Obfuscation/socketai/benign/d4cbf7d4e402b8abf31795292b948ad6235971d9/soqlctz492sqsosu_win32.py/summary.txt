  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Windows console API wrapper with heavy obfuscation. There is no evidence of malware or sabotage. The low malware score and high obfuscation score are justified. The moderate risk score accounts for potential misuse due to obfuscation. Overall, the code appears benign but warrants cautious review if part of a larger supply chain or deployed environment."
