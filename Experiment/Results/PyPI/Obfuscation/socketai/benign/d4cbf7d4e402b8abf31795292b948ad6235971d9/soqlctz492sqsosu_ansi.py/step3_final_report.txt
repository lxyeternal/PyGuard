{
  "purpose": "Generate terminal escape sequences for styling and control, obfuscated to conceal simplicity.",
  "sources": "Class attributes, function parameters, internal string concatenations",
  "sinks": "Terminal output sequences (ANSI escape codes)",
  "flows": "Attribute values wrapped with escape sequences, functions returning escape sequences based on inputs",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation via variable and class names, dynamic string concatenation, no malicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code constructs ANSI escape sequences for terminal styling, using obfuscated variable names and class attributes. No network, file, or system modification operations are present. The obfuscation appears to be for concealment rather than malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads are evident. The functions generate escape sequences based on input parameters, primarily for styling terminal output. The class hierarchy wraps attribute values with escape sequences, likely for styling purposes. No suspicious data flows or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated terminal styling utility. No malicious activity or security vulnerabilities are present. The obfuscation is notable but not malicious. The low malware score (0) and low security risk score (~0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality.",
