{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a series of functions and classes that manipulate terminal escape sequences, possibly for styling terminal output or controlling terminal behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads from class attributes and functions that generate escape sequence strings. It does not read external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "The code constructs escape sequences and modifies object attributes; no direct data leaks or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Attributes are initialized with escape sequences, then modified via methods that wrap their values with additional sequences. No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Code uses dynamic attribute setting and string concatenation with escape sequences. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are detected. No obfuscated code or malicious logic is evident. The purpose seems to be styling or controlling terminal output rather than malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines various functions to generate terminal escape sequences, and classes that initialize attributes with these sequences, then modify them dynamically. The pattern is consistent with styling terminal output or controlling terminal behavior. No external data sources, network activity, or suspicious behavior is observed. No obfuscated code features or malicious logic are present. The code structure is straightforward and aligns with terminal styling purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily designed for terminal output styling and does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. No evidence of malware, malicious data flow, or suspicious activity is detected.",
