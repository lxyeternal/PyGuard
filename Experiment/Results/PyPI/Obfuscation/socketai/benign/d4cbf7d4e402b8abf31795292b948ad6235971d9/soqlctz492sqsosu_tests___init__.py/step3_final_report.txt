  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "External network requests, environment variables, dynamic code execution (eval()/exec()), input data, data processing functions.",
  "sinks": "Network communication functions, environment variable access, dynamic code execution points, file I/O, data leaks.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or network requests flow into dynamic execution or data processing functions, which may lead to data exfiltration, external communication, or system modification.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of dynamic execution (eval()/exec()), environment variable usage, obfuscation patterns, external network requests, minimal or placeholder code with no clear logic.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits patterns such as dynamic code execution and environment variable usage, which are common in malicious scripts but can also be benign. No explicit malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are confirmed. External communication and dynamic features raise moderate suspicion, but without concrete payloads or behaviors, the likelihood of malicious intent remains low. The absence of obfuscation in most reports and minimal suspicious activity supports low malware and security risk scores. Slightly elevated scores in some reports reflect cautious monitoring rather than confirmed threats.",
  "conclusion": "Overall, the dependency code shows low to moderate suspicion primarily due to dynamic features and external communication patterns. No definitive malicious activity is detected. The scores assigned are appropriate, with minor adjustments to reflect the cautious stance. Continuous monitoring is recommended, especially for dynamically executed code and obfuscated patterns.",
