  "conclusion": "Overall, the dependency code shows low to moderate suspicion primarily due to dynamic features and external communication patterns. No definitive malicious activity is detected. The scores assigned are appropriate, with minor adjustments to reflect the cautious stance. Continuous monitoring is recommended, especially for dynamically executed code and obfuscated patterns."
