  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated identifiers, but no malicious activity or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static import statements from local modules with obfuscated names and a version string assignment. No external data sources, network activity, or code execution are evident. Obfuscation may be used for concealment but does not inherently indicate malicious intent. The absence of dynamic behavior or data flow reduces suspicion. The high obfuscation scores reflect the naming but are not indicative of malicious behavior. Malware and security risk scores should remain at zero or very low, consistent with the benign nature of the code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious activity. The obfuscation alone is not sufficient to assign a high malware risk. The code appears benign, and the current scoring aligns with this assessment. No further action is necessary unless additional code or context suggests otherwise.",
