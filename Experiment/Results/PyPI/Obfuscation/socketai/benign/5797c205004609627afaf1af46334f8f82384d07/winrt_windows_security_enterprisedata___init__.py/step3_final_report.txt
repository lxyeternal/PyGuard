{
  "purpose": "Static setup of Windows security-related enums and import of security modules, likely for use elsewhere in the application.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'winrt' library and enum class definitions with obfuscated names.",
  "sinks": "No data flows, network calls, or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "None; static enum definitions and imports only.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and enum names, which may indicate code obfuscation or auto-generation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and numerous enum class definitions with nonsensical or obfuscated names. There is no active logic, data processing, or network activity. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not inherently imply malicious intent. The malware score is correctly set to 0, as no malicious behavior is evident. The obfuscation score is high, justified by the nonsensical naming. The security risk score is very low, given the static nature and lack of active operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, obfuscated set of enum definitions and imports related to Windows security features. There is no evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or malicious data handling in this snippet. The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not indicate malicious intent based solely on static analysis.",
