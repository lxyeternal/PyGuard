{
  "purpose": "The code defines a data processing class for array quantization and clustering, utilizing numpy and optionally sklearn, with parameter validation and configurable methods.",
  "sources": "Reads input numpy arrays for processing; no external untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "Processes data internally within memory; no external data exfiltration or network communication.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays through numpy operations, percentile calculations, and clustering routines within the class methods.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are obfuscated, and sklearn import is conditional, which could be a form of obfuscation but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data normalization, quantization, and clustering tasks with thorough validation. No suspicious code patterns, network activity, or hardcoded secrets are present. Obfuscation appears to be stylistic or for code protection rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate data processing utility with no signs of supply chain compromise or malware. Obfuscation is present but not indicative of malicious behavior. The overall security risk is low.",
