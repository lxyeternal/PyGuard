  "purpose": "A class for numpy array processing, including statistical operations, reshaping, and random sampling, configurable via parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads from numpy.ndarray inputs, specifically the array 'LfYTIqLbOQxPzmoygyCRYjSknOmUXcUC' and optionally from 'tHqtgVQoqgeQBOGtwsYhxAgKanfatKEx'.",
  "sinks": "Outputs processed numpy arrays; no external network or file I/O observed.",
  "flows": "Array data flows through reshaping, selection, aggregation (max, min, mean), and random choice operations, with internal array manipulations and optional input copying.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated variable and method names, complex reshaping logic, use of numpy's RandomState with configurable seed, and repeated array operations that could be used to conceal malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code performs data transformations typical in ML or data analysis pipelines, with configurable parameters for statistical operation ('kind'), size, and per-channel processing. The obfuscation and complex reshaping could be used to hide malicious payloads, but no explicit malicious patterns such as network activity, file modification, or system commands are present. The use of numpy's random seed suggests deterministic behavior, possibly for reproducibility. The code's core functions are legitimate array manipulations, with no evident malicious intent. Variable obfuscation is superficial and may be stylistic or for code minification.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, albeit obfuscated, data processing utility. There is no concrete evidence of malicious activity, but the high obfuscation and complex reshaping warrant cautious review before deployment. The overall malware risk is low, with a malware score around 0.2, and the obfuscation score is high (~0.75). The security risk remains low (~0.2), but the obfuscation could be used to conceal malicious payloads in a larger context.",
