  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that could leak data or execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks in this minimal script.",
  "anomalies": "The script is extremely minimal and only calls setup() with default parameters. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'setuptools' library and calls the 'setup()' function with default arguments. It does not contain any hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, network operations, or other potentially malicious instructions. Given the simplicity, it appears to be a standard setup script for packaging a Python project, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
