  "purpose": "Minimal setup script for packaging a Python project using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup()' with no arguments.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code does not process external input or output data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks; the code simply executes a function call.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, minimal Python packaging script. It imports 'setuptools' and invokes 'setup()' without parameters, indicating a standard package setup. No external inputs, data flows, or malicious behaviors are present. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features suggest no security risks or malicious intent. The reports correctly identify this, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0 with high confidence.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and poses no security threat. All assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
