{
  "purpose": "To set up a Python package installation using setuptools.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code imports and uses the 'setuptools' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks; the code simply calls setup() without processing untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks present.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no unusual or suspicious constructs; no hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'setuptools' library and calls the setup() function with default parameters, which is standard in Python package setup scripts. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or unusual logic. The script does not process input, handle secrets, or execute external commands. It appears to be a basic setup script intended for package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign setup script for Python packages with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
