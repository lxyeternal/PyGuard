{
  "purpose": "To set up and install a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources; uses static import and function call.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data handling or untrusted data flow.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code simply calls setup() with default parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or unusual code constructs. The code is minimal and standard for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'setuptools' library and calls its setup() function with no arguments, which is typical for a minimal Python package setup. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious code execution are present. The code does not contain any dynamic execution, hardcoded secrets, or network activity. The simplicity indicates it's a standard setup script.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for Python packaging with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
