  "purpose": "A data transformation class performing interpolation and array manipulations, likely used in scientific or machine learning contexts.",
  "sources": "Inputs from numpy arrays, class attributes, and external parameters for interpolation and randomness.",
  "sinks": "Internal data structures; no external network, file, or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays through interpolation, array operations, and randomization functions, resulting in transformed output arrays.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, complex array manipulations, use of np.random.RandomState seeded with class attribute, but no explicit malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is heavily obfuscated with variable names designed to obscure intent, but the operations involve standard numpy/scipy functions for data interpolation and array processing. No network, file, or system commands are present. The use of a class attribute seed in RandomState could potentially be exploited for predictable outputs, but this alone does not indicate malicious intent. The complex data manipulations appear consistent with data augmentation or signal processing routines. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious payloads are detected. The high obfuscation score reflects variable naming, but the overall logic aligns with legitimate data processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a complex, obfuscated data transformation routine with no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The high obfuscation is typical in scientific or auto-generated code but does not imply malicious intent. The security risk is low, and the malware score is zero. The overall assessment indicates a benign utility with moderate obfuscation, suitable for cautious use in data processing pipelines.",
