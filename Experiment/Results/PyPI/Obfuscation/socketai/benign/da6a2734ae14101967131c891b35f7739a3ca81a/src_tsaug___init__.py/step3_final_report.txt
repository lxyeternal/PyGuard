  "purpose": "Import statements for various data augmentation functions from internal modules with obfuscated names.",
  "sources": "Internal module files such as _augmenter.add_noise, _augmenter.convolve, etc.",
  "sinks": "None; static import statements do not involve data sinks or external data flows.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; only static module imports.",
  "anomalies": "Use of non-descriptive, obfuscated variable and module names; no apparent malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from internal modules with obfuscated names, likely for internal organization. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration is present. The obfuscation appears superficial, serving perhaps to hide internal implementation details rather than malicious intent. The absence of suspicious behaviors such as code injection, network connections, or credential handling indicates low likelihood of malicious activity. The obfuscation level is high, but without evidence of malicious code, it is considered superficial.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily static import statements with superficial obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet. The obfuscation warrants cautious review of the entire package, but based solely on this code, the supply chain risk is minimal.",
