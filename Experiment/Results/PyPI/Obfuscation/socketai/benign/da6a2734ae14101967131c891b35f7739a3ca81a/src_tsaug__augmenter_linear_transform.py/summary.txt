  "obfuscated": 0.3,
  "confidence": 0.75,
  "conclusion": "The code shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, raising moderate security concerns but lacks concrete evidence of malicious activity. The malware score should be increased slightly to reflect the potential risk, especially in reports highlighting eval/exec usage. Overall, the supply chain risk remains low but warrants cautious monitoring."
