  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Dynamic code execution (eval/exec), hardcoded strings, input/output handling, environment variable access.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file system modifications, environment variable leaks, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Input data (sources) potentially passed to eval/exec or written to network/file sinks, often via conditional or obfuscated code paths.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec with untrusted data, obfuscated variable names, dynamic imports, suspicious conditional logic, inconsistent formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits patterns of dynamic execution and obfuscation, which increase suspicion. No explicit malicious payloads such as data exfiltration, system damage, or unauthorized network connections are confirmed. The presence of eval/exec and obfuscation suggests potential for malicious use but does not definitively indicate malicious intent. The code structure is otherwise typical for utility scripts, with no hardcoded credentials or suspicious network activity. The suspicion levels are moderate, justified by patterns rather than confirmed malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, raising moderate security concerns but lacks concrete evidence of malicious activity. The malware score should be increased slightly to reflect the potential risk, especially in reports highlighting eval/exec usage. Overall, the supply chain risk remains low but warrants cautious monitoring.",
