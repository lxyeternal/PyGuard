{
  "purpose": "Unit testing for a protein structure alignment and scoring library ('tmtools'), verifying correctness and exception handling.",
  "sources": "Fixtures providing numpy arrays; functions calling 'tmtools' methods; no external untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "Assertions on function outputs; no external data sinks or system interactions.",
  "flows": "Fixtures -> test functions -> 'tmtools' functions -> assertions; no external or untrusted data flows outside the test scope.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated variable and module names, such as 'jCYmWzXubcVXRXNyQiYOKneENVEJjNnM'; non-descriptive identifiers; obfuscation is suspicious but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard pytest suite testing alignment functions with fixtures and exception cases. No malicious code, network activity, or data exfiltration is present. The obfuscation of names suggests possible concealment but does not indicate malicious intent. The external 'tmtools' module's origin is unknown, which warrants caution, but the code itself performs benign validation of scientific functions.",
  "conclusion": "This supply chain code is a legitimate test suite for a structural bioinformatics library. No evidence of malware or malicious behavior is detected. The obfuscation is notable but likely stylistic or due to code generation. Overall, the code is low risk, with a malware score of 0, obfuscation score around 0.3, and a risk score of approximately 0.2.",
