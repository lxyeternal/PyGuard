  "purpose": "Constructs molecule objects with atoms, bonds, and configurations for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Internal method calls adding atoms, bonds, and configurations; filesystem path for test data directory.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or external system interactions; no data leaks or malicious sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from fixture setup into molecule construction and configuration methods; no external data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of pytest fixtures that initialize Molecule objects with specific atoms, bonds, and configurations. Variable names are obfuscated but used consistently within each fixture. No network activity, file writes (beyond reading test data), or external calls are present. The code appears to be standard test setup code for molecular data structures, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. Obfuscation is superficial and typical in test code, not indicative of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign test setup code for molecular structures, with obfuscated variable names but no malicious activity or security risks. The current scores are appropriate, with malware score at 0, obfuscated score around 0.2-0.3, and low security risk (~0.2). No adjustments are necessary.",
