  "purpose": "The code imports three variables with obfuscated names from a module within the 'configalchemy' package and assigns a version string to a variable.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'configalchemy.configalchemy' module.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Import of variables from the module; assignment of version string to a variable.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names and the non-standard package name 'configalchemy' resembling 'SQLAlchemy'.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward import of three obfuscated variables from a module in 'configalchemy' and assigns a version string. No code execution, data leaks, or network activity are visible. The obfuscated naming and package name are suspicious but not inherently malicious. The scores reflect high obfuscation (0.7), no malware (0), and low security risk (0.2). The code appears benign but warrants further review of the broader codebase and package legitimacy.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with obfuscated identifiers; no malicious activity is evident. The high obfuscation score is justified, and the low security risk score is appropriate. Further investigation of the package 'configalchemy' is recommended, but based solely on this snippet, the code does not pose a threat.",
