  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, user inputs, external files, network connections, dynamic code execution points.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file system operations, environment variable access, subprocess calls, dynamic eval/exec.",
  "flows": "Input sources (variables, environment, user input) to sinks (network, file, subprocess), potentially via dynamic execution or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal obfuscation (e.g., obfuscated variable names, dynamic execution), code reading external inputs, placeholder or empty scripts.",
  "analysis": "All reports lacking code are correctly scored with zero maliciousness and risk. Report 2 and 4 show benign code with minor obfuscation or data flow considerations; their scores reflect cautious but justified assessments. No evidence of malicious activity or high security threats is present. The slight obfuscation in Report 4 is acknowledged but not indicative of malicious intent. Overall, the scores are consistent with the code descriptions and reasoning, with only a minor suggestion to lower the security risk score in Report 2 from 0.2 to 0 for increased accuracy.",
  "conclusion": "The provided reports are accurate and appropriately scored based on the available information. No significant malicious indicators are identified. Minor obfuscation or data flow considerations do not elevate risk scores substantially. The overall security posture inferred from these reports is benign.",
