  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class for handling invalid type cast errors with detailed information.",
  "sources": "The class uses input parameters PiSWhiPnmyZilppZnRRfjYsnLItqoSFq (string) and FSYIBfoYvIBRVyrlvkOLjqTEULIZIlJE (any type).",
  "sinks": "The __repr__ method generates a string representation, but does not output or send data externally.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are stored in the exception object and used in __repr__ to produce a message; no external data flow or network activity occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present. The class simply stores and displays info.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception with two parameters, stores them, and formats a string for representation. It lacks any external data transmission, code injection, or malicious behavior indicators. The class appears to be for debugging or error reporting purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears benign and serves as a custom exception class without malicious intent or security risks.",
