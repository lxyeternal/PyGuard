  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for invalid type casting or validation errors.",
  "sources": "Input parameters PiSWhiPnmyZilppZnRRfjYsnLItqoSFq and FSYIBfoYvIBRVyrlvkOLjqTEULIZIlJE used in the exception initialization and representation.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no data leakage, network activity, or system modification occurs.",
  "flows": "The class stores input data in instance variables; __repr__ method outputs formatted string but does not execute untrusted code.",
  "anomalies": "The class uses highly obfuscated and nonsensical naming conventions; however, this is likely for obfuscation or stylistic choice rather than malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an exception class with obfuscated names, likely to hinder readability. It captures a string and any other data type as part of an exception. The __repr__ method outputs descriptive info about the exception. No suspicious behavior, data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious actions are present. The obfuscated naming could be suspicious, but it is consistent with general obfuscation practices rather than malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward custom exception class with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet.",
