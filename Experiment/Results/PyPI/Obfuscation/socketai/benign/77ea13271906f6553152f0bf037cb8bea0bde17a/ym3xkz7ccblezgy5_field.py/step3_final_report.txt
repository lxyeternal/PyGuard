  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class with obfuscated naming, storing a string identifier and an arbitrary value, providing a string representation.",
  "sources": "Input parameters PiSWhiPnmyZilppZnRRfjYsnLItqoSFq and FSYIBfoYvIBRVyrlvkOLjqTEULIZIlJE during instantiation.",
  "sinks": "The __repr__ method outputs a formatted string; no external data, network activity, or code execution occurs.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are stored in instance variables and later formatted into a string in __repr__.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names; no malicious code or external data handling; straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, correctly implemented custom exception class with obfuscated identifiers. No external interactions, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are present. Obfuscation appears superficial, serving stylistic or concealment purposes rather than malicious intent. The __repr__ method outputs the stored data without executing or exposing external data. The code does not perform any I/O, network activity, or code injection. The obfuscation does not impact security but reduces readability.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with superficial obfuscation. No evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware score 0, low security risk) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.7,
