  "purpose": "Custom exception class for handling invalid type cast errors related to configuration data.",
  "sources": "Input data is passed to the constructor of the exception class, specifically the string identifier and an arbitrary value.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks; no output or data leak points within this code fragment.",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor parameters to class attributes and then to the __repr__ method for string representation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of an obfuscated class name and variable names, which can be a sign of deliberate obfuscation. No external data sources, no network or file I/O, or code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an exception class with obfuscated naming, storing input parameters and providing a string representation method. No suspicious operations, data leaks, or external interactions are present. The obfuscated names could be an attempt at hiding intent, but the code itself performs no malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward custom exception class with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or security risks within this fragment.",
