  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling invalid type cast errors with detailed message output.",
  "sources": "Input parameters in the __init__ method: PiSWhiPnmyZilppZnRRfjYsnLItqoSFq (string), FSYIBfoYvIBRVyrlvkOLjqTEULIZIlJE (any type).",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; the code only assigns and formats data for representation.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters to class attributes and then into the __repr__ method for string formatting.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The class name and variable names appear obfuscated but do not inherently suggest malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class with an obfuscated name. It stores a string and an arbitrary value as attributes. The __repr__ method formats these attributes into a string. There is no evidence of data leaks, external data access, or malicious behavior. The obfuscated naming might suggest an attempt to conceal intent, but functionally, it is a straightforward exception class. No suspicious code patterns, external calls, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, obfuscated custom exception class with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. The obfuscation appears superficial and does not indicate malicious intent.",
