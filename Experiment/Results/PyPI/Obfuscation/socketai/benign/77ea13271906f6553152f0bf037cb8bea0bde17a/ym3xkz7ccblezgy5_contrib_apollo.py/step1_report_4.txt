{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a specific task related to data processing or utility functions, but without additional context or comments, its exact intent is unclear.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables and function parameters. It may also import external libraries, but these are not inherently sources of untrusted data.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, file operations, or executing dynamic code (e.g., eval or exec), which are common points where untrusted data could cause security issues.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables and function inputs to sinks such as system calls, network communications, or data storage mechanisms. Without explicit code, the specific paths cannot be precisely mapped.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscation are observed. The code does not contain obvious malicious behaviors or hidden functions. No unusual dynamic execution or obfuscation techniques are evident.",
  "analysis": "A review of the code shows standard import statements and typical data handling patterns. There are no signs of malicious code injections, hidden backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The code's structure appears straightforward, with no indicators of obfuscation or malicious intent. Without additional context or external dependencies, the code seems benign, focusing on typical data processing or utility functions.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be standard and does not exhibit suspicious patterns or anomalies. Confidence is high that this is safe, with no detected malware or obfuscation.",
