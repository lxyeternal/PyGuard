  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Standard data sources, code input points, and dynamic execution points.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network communication, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Sources to sinks via code execution paths, including dynamic execution and obfuscation.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation (score 0.4), dynamic code execution, complex variable names, but no confirmed malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate low or no malware presence, with some suspicion of obfuscation in Report 3. The code appears benign overall, with no hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns. The scores are consistent with the described analysis, with malware scores at 0 or near zero, obfuscation slightly elevated in Report 3, and low security risk scores. Confidence levels are high, and no significant anomalies are observed beyond suspicion of obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency shows no evidence of malicious intent or supply chain compromise. The low malware and security risk scores are justified. Slight obfuscation suspicion in one report does not indicate malicious activity. Overall, the code is considered safe with minimal risk.",
