  "conclusion": "The dependency code shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, raising moderate suspicion but lacking confirmed malicious payloads. The scores are generally appropriate, with a slight adjustment to malware suspicion in the first report to better match observed behaviors. No definitive malicious activity is identified, but caution is advised due to obfuscation indicators."
