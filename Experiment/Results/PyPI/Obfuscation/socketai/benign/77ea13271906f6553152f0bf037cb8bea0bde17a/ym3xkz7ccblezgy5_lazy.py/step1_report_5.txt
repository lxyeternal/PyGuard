  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a simple demonstration or utility script that performs some basic operations, possibly for data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from user input, environment variables, or external files, depending on the specific implementation. Specific source locations are not provided in the snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or data output functions, especially if untrusted input is processed and transmitted or stored without validation.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as user input or environment variables to sinks like network or file operations, possibly passing through processing functions or transformations.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns are visible. The code does not contain obfuscation, malicious system calls, or obscure behavior. However, the absence of specific details limits certainty.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed for common security issues, including hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, or obfuscated constructs. No such patterns were identified. The code's structure is straightforward, and usage of third-party libraries seems benign. Without specific code snippets, the analysis is limited, but no signs of malicious intent or security risks are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a standard utility or demonstration script without malicious intent. Confidence is moderate due to lack of detailed code, but nothing suspicious was observed.",
  "confidence": 0.7,
  "obfuscated": 0,
