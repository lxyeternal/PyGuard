{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a benign utility or data processing script with no malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Potentially reads input data, environment variables, or files; no explicit sources identified.",
  "sinks": "No evidence of data leaks, network connections, or sensitive data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources to processing functions; no untrusted data leading to dangerous sinks identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal or missing, limiting detailed analysis. All reports agree on the benign nature, with low malware (0), no obfuscation (0), and low security risk (~0.2-0.3). Confidence scores are moderate to high, reflecting limited visibility but consistent assessments. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation are present. The risk scores are conservative, considering potential unvalidated inputs, but no concrete threats are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly likely benign with no malicious indicators or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, and the assessments across reports are consistent and justified. No further action or adjustment of scores is necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "obfuscated": 0,
