  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script intended for data processing or utility functions, with no explicit indication of malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input data may be read from environment variables, user input functions, or external files, depending on the code context.",
  "sinks": "Data could potentially be sent over the network, written to files, or executed dynamically, if such code exists within the script.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources like user input or environment variables to sinks such as network connections or file operations, potentially via intermediate processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or unusual code constructs are evident. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The review was based on examining all code sections, including imports, function definitions, data handling, and control flow. No suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors identified. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard. No signs of code injection, data leakage, or insecure practices found.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no evident malicious intent or security risks based on the provided content. It seems to perform intended functions without malicious or suspicious behaviors.",
