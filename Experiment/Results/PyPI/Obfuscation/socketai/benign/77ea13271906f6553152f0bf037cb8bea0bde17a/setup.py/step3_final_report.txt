  "purpose": "Heavily obfuscated setup.py script that reads description files and calls setup() with various parameters.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' and 'HISTORY.rst' files, variable assignments, parameter definitions in setup()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, network calls, or dynamic code execution observed",
  "flows": "File reads -> variable assignments -> setup() call with parameters",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation, nonsensical variable names, suspicious strings (possibly encoded), malformed parameters such as 'aFEnCfOWIUAkcZGecaKYMzpwAumsrcOR=True'",
  "analysis": "The code is a heavily obfuscated setup script with nonsensical variable names and suspicious strings. No evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration. The obfuscation appears superficial, possibly intended to conceal complexity. Syntax irregularities are likely due to obfuscation or corruption but do not indicate malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (high obfuscation, low malware, low risk) are consistent with the observed code. No active malicious actions are present, and the code functions as a standard setup script with obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is an obfuscated setup script with no evidence of malicious activity. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware and security risk scores are low. It appears benign, though obfuscation warrants caution. No immediate security threat is identified based on this snippet.",
