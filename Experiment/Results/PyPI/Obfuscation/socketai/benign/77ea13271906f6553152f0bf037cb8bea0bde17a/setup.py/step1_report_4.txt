  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, defining dependencies, metadata, and configuration for package distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.rst' and 'HISTORY.rst' files for long descriptions; loads dependency lists and configuration parameters within the script.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leak or execution; uses static files and predefined variables.",
  "flows": "Reads files for description; uses static variables for dependencies and configuration; calls setup() with parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variable names and seemingly random strings; inconsistent variable naming and strange variable values (e.g., 'aFEnCfOWIUAkcZGecaKYMzpwAumsrcOR=True'). These could be obfuscation attempts or placeholder values, but are not malicious by themselves.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with unusual variable names and some obfuscated-looking strings. No dynamic code execution, no suspicious network calls, or hidden backdoors are present. The variables appear to be randomly named or obfuscated, but they do not execute any malicious actions. The script simply prepares package metadata and dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with some obfuscated variable names and placeholder values. No signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks are evident. The obfuscation appears superficial or placeholder, not malicious.",
