  "purpose": "Defines an interface class with obfuscated method names, primarily providing timezone offset calculation.",
  "sources": "Reads 'time' module functions for timezone information; accepts 'context' parameter during initialization.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, network activity, or data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "Method 'mLLQOuDIqtXrndnGWsjrZoTiiurTTGqk' retrieves timezone offset using system time functions; no external data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names; only timezone calculation implemented; no malicious code or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is an interface class with obfuscated identifiers, performing a benign timezone offset calculation. No network, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is present. Obfuscation appears superficial, likely for concealment or code generation. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions suggest low security risk. Malware score is zero; obfuscation score is high (~0.8); security risk score is low (~0.2).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated interface class with no evidence of malicious activity or security threats. Obfuscation likely for concealment or code generation purposes. No further action required.",
