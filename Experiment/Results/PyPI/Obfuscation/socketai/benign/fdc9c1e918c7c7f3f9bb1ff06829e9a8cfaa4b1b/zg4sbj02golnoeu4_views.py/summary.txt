  "conclusion": "The code is primarily designed for system time management via API endpoints but contains critical security flaws due to unsanitized user input in subprocess calls, posing a high risk of command injection. No malware or obfuscation is detected. The main issue is the insecure handling of inputs, which could be exploited to execute arbitrary commands, potentially compromising the system. The overall security risk score is high (~0.75), though the code does not exhibit malicious intent."
