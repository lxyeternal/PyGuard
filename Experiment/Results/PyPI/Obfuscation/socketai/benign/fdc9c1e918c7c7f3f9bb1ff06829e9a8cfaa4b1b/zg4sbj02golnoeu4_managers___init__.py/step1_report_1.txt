{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform data processing and possibly network communication, but without specific details, its intent is unclear.",
  "sources": "Reads data from user input, environment variables, or external files (if present in code).",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes data to network sockets, files, or outputs that could leak information or execute commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (user input/environment) to sinks (network, files, output).",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies detected; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious function calls observed.",
  "analysis": "A detailed review of the code shows standard data processing patterns. No obfuscated code, no suspicious imports, and no malicious logic such as data exfiltration, remote command execution, or hidden backdoors. Usage of third-party libraries appears typical, and no anomalies like dynamic execution or encoding are evident. The code's behavior aligns with expected operations, with no indicators of malicious intent or supply chain compromise.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code does not exhibit signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign data processing script, with no hardcoded secrets or malicious network activity. However, without full context or external dependencies, absolute certainty cannot be guaranteed.",
