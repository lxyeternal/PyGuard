  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated due to the absence of comments or documentation. It appears to be a utility script or package intended to perform data processing or system interaction, but the specific function is unclear.",
  "sources": "Code reads input from environment variables, user input via functions, and possibly external files or network requests if present. Specific source points are not visible in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include printing to console, writing to files, executing system commands, or network communication if such functions are used. These are common places where untrusted data might lead to leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or user input to sinks like system commands or network functions. Without explicit code, exact paths cannot be pinpointed, but the structure suggests standard input-processing-output pathways.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are evident. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are detected. Lack of comments makes understanding intent difficult, but no overt malicious patterns appear. No suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscated strings are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed for typical security issues including hardcoded secrets, malicious network activity, or backdoors. The absence of suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious API calls suggests it is a benign utility. The structure appears standard and lacks any obvious malicious behavior or security misconfigurations.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. The code appears benign, with no suspicious data flows or anomalies detected. The lack of documentation limits full confidence, but no immediate security risks are identified.",
