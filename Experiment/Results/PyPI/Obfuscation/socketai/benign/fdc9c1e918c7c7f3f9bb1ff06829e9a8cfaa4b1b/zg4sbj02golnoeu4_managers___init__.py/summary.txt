  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with low security risks; Report 2 exhibits suspicious behavior justified by high obfuscation and malicious patterns, warranting a slightly higher malware score. Overall, the assessments are consistent and appropriate, with minor score adjustment for Report 2 to better reflect its suspicious indicators."
