  "purpose": "Analyze the provided Python code snippets for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks to assess supply chain security implications.",
  "sources": "Input data reading points, environment variables, network calls, file operations, dynamic code execution, hardcoded credentials.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission functions, file write/read, subprocess calls, eval/exec statements, environment variable access, data leakage points.",
  "flows": "Input data or environment variables to network or file sinks via dynamic execution or data processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation scores, dynamic code execution, hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, absence of code or minimal content in some reports.",
  "analysis": "Report 1 indicates benign code with no suspicious patterns, justified by zero malware and obfuscation scores, high confidence (0.9). Report 2 shows obfuscation, dynamic execution, network activity, with high malware (0.7) and obfuscation (0.8) scores, justified by suspicious patterns, confidence 0.8. Reports 3, 4, and 5 lack code or show benign patterns, with scores reflecting low risk and malware, and high confidence where applicable. The scores are consistent with the described behaviors. Notably, Report 2's high obfuscation and malicious indicators justify elevated scores. Minor adjustment recommended: increase malware score in Report 2 from 0.7 to 0.8 for better alignment with suspicion levels.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with low security risks; Report 2 exhibits suspicious behavior justified by high obfuscation and malicious patterns, warranting a slightly higher malware score. Overall, the assessments are consistent and appropriate, with minor score adjustment for Report 2 to better reflect its suspicious indicators.",
