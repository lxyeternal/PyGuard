  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, reading dependencies from 'requirements.txt' and configuring package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'requirements.txt' file for dependencies",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data processing or data leaks evident",
  "flows": "Reading 'requirements.txt' and assigning its processed content to a variable used in setup",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names and unconventional variable assignments; no actual malicious activity detected",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup functions, reads dependencies from 'requirements.txt', processes them, and calls setup with package info. The code's obfuscated variable names suggest an attempt to hide intent but do not introduce malicious behavior. No data exfiltration, code injection, or suspicious network activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard package setup script with obfuscated variable names but no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
