  "purpose": "A standard Python package setup script using setuptools, reading a README file and configuring package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'readme.rst' file; static data from local file; no untrusted input.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Read file -> assign to variable -> pass metadata to setuptools.setup()",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; no dynamic code execution, eval, or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with obfuscated variable names but no malicious behavior. It reads a local README file and calls setuptools.setup() with package info, dependencies, and classifiers. No dynamic or untrusted data handling is present. The obfuscation alone does not indicate malicious intent, and dependencies are benign. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the benign nature of the code, with some variation in obfuscation suspicion but no evidence of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated setup script for a Python package with no malware or security risks. Obfuscation is suspicious but not malicious. The low malware and risk scores are appropriate. The overall security posture is very low risk.",
