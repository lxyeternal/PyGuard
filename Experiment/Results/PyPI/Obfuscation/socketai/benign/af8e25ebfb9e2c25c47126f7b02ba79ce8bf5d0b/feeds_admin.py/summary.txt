  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate Django admin customization with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malware, malicious behavior, or supply chain compromise. The use of mark_safe() is acceptable here assuming data is controlled. The obfuscation does not imply malicious intent. Overall, the supply chain security risk is minimal, with scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0.7, risk=0.2."
