  "purpose": "Admin interface customizations for models in a Django project, providing links to related objects.",
  "sources": "Model methods generating HTML links with reverse URL lookups, accessing related object querysets.",
  "sinks": "mark_safe calls rendering HTML with URL and object data, potentially vulnerable if data is untrusted.",
  "flows": "Querysets and object data used in URL generation and HTML output through mark_safe.",
  "anomalies": "Use of mark_safe with data directly from querysets; no explicit hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code; no external data inputs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code customizes Django admin for specific models, creating links to related objects. It uses reverse() to generate admin URLs and mark_safe() to output HTML links, which is standard practice. The data used in URL parameters is derived from object IDs and queryset counts, which are integers from the database, reducing risk. No external data inputs, environment variables, or untrusted sources are directly used in a risky way. No obfuscated or suspicious code constructs are present. The purpose is purely for admin UI enhancements, with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard Django admin customization with safe handling of data. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected. It appears to be legitimate code intended to improve admin usability.",
