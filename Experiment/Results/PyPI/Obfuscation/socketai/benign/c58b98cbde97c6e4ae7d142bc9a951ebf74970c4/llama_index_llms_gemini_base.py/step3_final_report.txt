  "purpose": "A deprecated wrapper class around Google's generative AI SDK, configuring models and handling content/chat generation through SDK calls.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for API keys, class parameters, SDK model calls, prompt inputs, and chat messages.",
  "sinks": "Calls to SDK generate_content and chat methods, returning responses; no external network or file operations outside SDK.",
  "flows": "Input prompts/messages flow into SDK methods; responses are returned after processing; UUIDs used for tool calls; data flows through class methods into SDK and back.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, use of deprecated modules, dynamic attribute setting, complex nested structures, but no hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a complex, obfuscated wrapper around Google's SDK, primarily configuring models via environment variables and class parameters. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful system modifications. The obfuscation appears to be due to variable naming conventions or code generation, not malicious intent. The use of deprecated modules indicates the need for updating, but does not imply malicious activity. The code's flow is standard for SDK wrappers, with inputs passing into SDK calls and responses returned. No suspicious network activity or data leaks are detected. The malware score is consistent with the absence of malicious code; the obfuscation score is justified given variable naming complexity; the overall security risk remains low.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a complex, obfuscated wrapper around Google's generative AI SDK with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The primary concerns are obfuscation and deprecated modules, which do not currently pose active threats. The malware score is 0, obfuscation around 0.6, and overall security risk approximately 0.2. It is advisable to refactor variable names for clarity and update deprecated modules, but the current assessment indicates low security risk.",
