  "conclusion": "The code is a complex, obfuscated wrapper around Google's generative AI SDK with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The primary concerns are obfuscation and deprecated modules, which do not currently pose active threats. The malware score is 0, obfuscation around 0.6, and overall security risk approximately 0.2. It is advisable to refactor variable names for clarity and update deprecated modules, but the current assessment indicates low security risk."
