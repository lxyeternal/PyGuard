  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated and delegates to an external class, which raises suspicion but does not provide direct evidence of malicious activity. The obfuscation and delegation pattern are typical in malicious payloads aiming to hide functionality. Scores should reflect moderate suspicion, with a malware score around 0.5 and a high obfuscation score (~0.9). Further investigation into the imported class is necessary before making definitive security judgments."
