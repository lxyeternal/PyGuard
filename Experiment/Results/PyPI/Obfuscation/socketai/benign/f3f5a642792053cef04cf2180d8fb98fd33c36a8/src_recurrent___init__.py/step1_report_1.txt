  "purpose": "Wrapper functions that delegate calls to methods of a class imported from a potentially obfuscated module.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'PNKUnGFkPrFxbCGcTkGBKkeqJuQdOBHj' and optional 'jAeHEwKQaVxjngHsZvhJOtafjqulsxFA' passed into functions.",
  "sinks": "Method calls on objects instantiated with 'DDAaGjWnGJaHQrsvUcmtrLAwTCsCYizC', potentially involving data processing or output formatting.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are passed into functions, which then create an object of the imported class, then invoke methods that could process or output data.",
  "anomalies": "The class and method names appear intentionally obfuscated, which is common in malicious code to hide intent. No explicit hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are evident. No direct network activity or data exfiltration is visible within this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a module with an obfuscated name. It defines two functions: one that delegates to a method 'RrrNYLiiqWXyJdOgyrjCYBIcezEuDEfq' of the imported class instance, and another that calls 'format' on the same class instance. The functions serve as wrappers and do not perform any processing themselves. The obfuscated naming pattern and delegation to dynamically instantiated objects are typical in code designed to obscure behavior, but there is no concrete evidence of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system manipulation in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be an obfuscated wrapper around class methods, potentially designed to hide true functionality. There is no direct evidence of malicious behavior or security risks within this limited fragment, but the obfuscation warrants caution as it could be part of a larger malicious scheme.",
