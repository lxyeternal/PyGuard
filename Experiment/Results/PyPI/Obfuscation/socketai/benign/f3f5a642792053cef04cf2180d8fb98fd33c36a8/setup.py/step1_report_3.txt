  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools, assignment of version strings, setup() function with parameters.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data, no code execution or data leak points.",
  "flows": "Import statements and variable assignments feed into the setup() function parameters; no external data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; some variables appear to be random or intentionally obscured; no hardcoded credentials or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and defines package metadata with obfuscated variable names. The setup() function is called with parameters including version, license, classifiers, and dependencies. No user input, network calls, or dynamic code execution present. The obfuscation of variable names (e.g., szcCemjSIDowDLQpOmYUEWezOMJJCMfl, FVSSMJEPWIiToKNcoHXrFCrakTnNQSPh) seems unnecessary and may be an attempt to hide intent but does not itself indicate malicious activity. No suspicious code or malicious patterns found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with obfuscated variable names. No evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks identified. The obfuscation appears superficial and does not suggest malicious intent.",
