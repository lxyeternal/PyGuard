  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded strings for version, license key, and install_requires list.",
  "sinks": "No evident untrusted data sinks; the code primarily sets package metadata.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration; no data flow from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names, such as szcCemjSIDowDLQpOmYUEWezOMJJCMfl and FVSSMJEPWIiToKNcoHXrFCrakTnNQSPh, which seem obfuscated or auto-generated. The license key 'ug72n2iupdgvnvhi' appears hardcoded but is not necessarily malicious. The dependency version string '>3.6.0' is unusual as it is typically '>=3.6.0'.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names, possibly to hinder readability. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or malicious logic is present. The hardcoded license key and version strings could be suspicious but are not inherently malicious. The use of non-standard comparison operators in 'install_requires' is syntactically valid but unconventional, which might suggest obfuscation or errors. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate package setup with obfuscated variable names, likely to hide its purpose or origin.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script does not contain malicious behavior or malware. The obfuscated variable names and unusual syntax suggest attempts to obscure intent, but there is no evidence of malicious actions. It appears to be a standard package configuration with some obfuscation but no security risks identified.",
