  "purpose": "Setup configuration script for a Python package, defining package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers.",
  "sources": "The 'setup' function call, reading package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating data leak, command execution, or untrusted data handling identified.",
  "flows": "Input data from parameters and variables flows into the setup() function, which processes package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names (e.g., szcCemjSIDowDLQpOmYUEWezOMJJCMfl, FVSSMJEPWIiToKNcoHXrFCrakTnNQSPh) that appear obfuscated or randomly generated. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code detected. No external data handling or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for Python packaging using setuptools. It defines package version, dependencies, classifiers, and other metadata. Variable names appear intentionally obfuscated, which could be an attempt to hide intent, but they only serve as non-descriptive identifiers with no functional malicious behavior. No suspicious imports or functions, and no external communications or dangerous patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical Python package setup configuration with obfuscated variable names but no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be an ordinary package metadata definition.",
