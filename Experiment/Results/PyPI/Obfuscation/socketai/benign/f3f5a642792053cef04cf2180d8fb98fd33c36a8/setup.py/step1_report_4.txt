  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, configuring metadata, dependencies, and package information.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools, string variables defining version numbers, and setup() function parameters.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows from sources to sinks; static setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names (e.g., szcCemjSIDowDLQpOmYUEWezOMJJCMfl) and inconsistent parameter naming (e.g., FVSSMJEPWIiToKNcoHXrFCrakTnNQSPh). These may be obfuscation attempts or nonsensical naming, but do not indicate malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py configuration for a Python package. It imports setuptools, defines version variables with obfuscated names, and calls setup() with package metadata. No untrusted input handling, no network calls, no dynamic execution, and no evidence of malicious intent. Variable names are unusual but do not impact security directly. The structure aligns with standard package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard package setup file with obfuscated variable names, likely for code obfuscation or style. There are no malicious behaviors, data leaks, or security risks detected. The code is benign.",
