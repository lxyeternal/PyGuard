{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for the 'elektra' package utilities and functions related to data processing and validation.",
  "sources": "Data inputs from function parameters, datetime objects, and hardcoded date ranges within tests.",
  "sinks": "Function calls to 'elektra' module functions with input data, and data manipulations such as applying transformations and calculations.",
  "flows": "Data is sourced from test parameters and internal date calculations, passed into 'elektra' functions, and results are validated with assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials. The code primarily uses standard libraries and calls to 'elektra' functions; no suspicious dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of unittests for the 'elektra' package, testing various functions with different date inputs and data manipulations. The functions called appear to perform data processing and validation, with no evidence of data exfiltration, remote network activity, or malicious backdoors. The data flows are contained within controlled test inputs and expected outputs. No obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious logic identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be legitimate unit testing code for the 'elektra' package, focusing on data validation and processing. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain attacks.",
