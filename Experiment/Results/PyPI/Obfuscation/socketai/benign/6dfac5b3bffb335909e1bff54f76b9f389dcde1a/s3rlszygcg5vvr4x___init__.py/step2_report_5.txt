  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check their claims, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code: `from .elektra import *`.\n- The code is a simple import statement, with no additional logic or data handling.\n- The primary concern is the use of wildcard import, which can obscure imported symbols and potentially hide malicious code if the module is compromised.\n- The actual content of the 'elektra' module is unknown, so any risk assessment is inherently limited.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code snippet is accurately described across all reports.\n- No malicious activity or code is visible in the snippet itself.\n- The use of `import *` is discouraged due to namespace pollution but is not inherently malicious.\n\n### Errors or flaws in the reports:\n- No factual errors are evident; all reports correctly identify the nature of the import statement.\n- Some reports assign a *malware* score of 0, which is appropriate given the information.\n- The *securityRisk* scores are low, reflecting the minimal code shown.\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is reasonable given no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward import statement.\n- **Risk score:** Mostly low (around 0.1 to 0.2), which is appropriate. The only exception is report 3 with 0.2, which is acceptable given the potential for malicious symbols to be hidden in the module.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign risk scores higher than 0.2, which aligns with the minimal code and the lack of evidence of malicious activity.\n- If any report had assigned a high risk score (>0.5), I would challenge it unless there was evidence of malicious content or suspicious behavior.\n\n### Specific comments:\n- **Use of wildcard import:** All reports mention this as a concern but correctly state it is not inherently malicious.\n- **Potential for malicious code:** Since the content of 'elektra' is unknown, the risk remains speculative. The import itself is benign.\n- **Data leaks or code injection:** Not possible to determine from this snippet alone; no evidence supports such claims.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (consistent with all reports)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation evident)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (appropriate, given the minimal risk and lack of malicious evidence)\n\n### My own estimate:\nConsidering all factors, I would assign:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (low, primarily due to the wildcard import and lack of context)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code snippet is benign. The main concern is the use of wildcard import, which can obscure what symbols are imported, but this alone does not indicate malicious intent. Without inspecting the 'elektra' module, no higher risk can be justified.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nAlways review the contents of imported modules, especially when wildcard imports are used, to ensure no malicious code is hidden.",
