  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code: `from .elektra import *`.\n- The code is a simple import statement, with no additional logic or data handling.\n- The primary concern raised is the use of wildcard import (`*`), which can obscure what symbols are imported and potentially hide malicious or unwanted code.\n- No evidence of malicious activity, hardcoded secrets, or code obfuscation is present in the snippet.\n- The actual content of the `elektra` module is unknown, which limits the assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The reported issues (use of wildcard import, potential obscurity) are accurate.\n- There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious code in the provided snippet itself.\n- The import statement alone does not indicate malicious intent; it depends on the contents of `elektra`.\n\n### Errors or flaws in the reports:\n- All reports correctly identify the potential risks of wildcard imports but conclude that the code is benign.\n- No report suggests that the `elektra` module contains malicious code, which is appropriate given the limited context.\n- The reasoning is consistent across reports, emphasizing that the import statement itself is not malicious but warrants caution.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of evidence for malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 in all cases, which is correct.\n- **Security risk scores:** Range from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting minimal concern due to the import style but acknowledging the potential risks of obscured symbols.\n\n**Suggestion:** The scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.2, which is appropriate.\n- Given the lack of evidence of malicious activity and the benign nature of the code snippet, higher scores are unwarranted.\n\n### Potential issues:\n- The reports do not consider the possibility that the `elektra` module itself could be malicious. While this is outside the scope of the snippet, it's worth noting that if `elektra` contains malicious code, the import could introduce risks.\n- However, without access to the module, we cannot assess this.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (low, due to wildcard import, but overall benign)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe import statement is standard, with no immediate security concerns. The main issue is the use of `import *`, which can hinder code clarity and maintainability, but it does not inherently introduce security risks. The content of `elektra` remains unknown, so further inspection would be necessary to rule out malicious code within that module.\n\n**Overall recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis reflects a benign snippet with a minor maintainability concern rather than a security threat.",
