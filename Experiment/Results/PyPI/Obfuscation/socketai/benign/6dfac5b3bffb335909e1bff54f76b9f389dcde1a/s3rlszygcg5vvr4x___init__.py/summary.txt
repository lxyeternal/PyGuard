  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign and does not exhibit malicious behavior. The main concern is the use of wildcard import, which can hide malicious symbols if 'elektra' is compromised, but this cannot be confirmed from the snippet alone. Overall, the security risk is minimal, and no malware is detected."
