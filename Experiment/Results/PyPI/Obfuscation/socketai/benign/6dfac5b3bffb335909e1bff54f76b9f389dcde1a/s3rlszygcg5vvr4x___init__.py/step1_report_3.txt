{
  "purpose": "The code imports all symbols from a module named 'elektra'.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the 'elektra' module from the current package.",
  "sinks": "The code does not include any further operations, so there are no direct sinks.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis is possible beyond the import statement, which is a static import.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; however, using 'from .elektra import *' can obscure what is imported and may hide malicious or unwanted symbols. No other anomalies are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports all contents from a local module named 'elektra'. Without inspecting the contents of 'elektra', it is impossible to determine if malicious code is included. The import itself is a standard Python practice but can be risky if 'elektra' contains malicious code or unexpected behavior. The code lacks additional context, functions, or logic, making a comprehensive assessment limited. The use of a wildcard import is generally discouraged as it can introduce hidden or unwanted code into the namespace.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no immediate malicious behavior. However, due to the use of wildcard import and lack of visibility into 'elektra', there is some uncertainty regarding its contents. The overall risk is low but warrants further inspection of the 'elektra' module for malicious code or hidden backdoors.",
