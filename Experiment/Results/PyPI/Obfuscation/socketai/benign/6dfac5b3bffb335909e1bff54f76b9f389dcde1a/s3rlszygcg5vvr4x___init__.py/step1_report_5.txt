  "purpose": "Import all contents from the 'elektra' module, likely to use its functions or classes elsewhere in the package.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing from the local 'elektra' module",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present in this snippet",
  "flows": "Imported symbols from 'elektra' may be used throughout the code, but no direct source-to-sink flow is visible in this fragment",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import 'from .elektra import *' can obscure what is imported, potentially hiding malicious or unintended code, but this alone is not malicious",
  "analysis": "This code only performs a relative import from the 'elektra' module. There is no execution or data manipulation here. The use of wildcard import can be a concern for maintainability and clarity but does not inherently indicate malicious behavior. Without additional context or code, no malicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet is a simple import statement with no direct malicious behavior. The use of wildcard import is a common practice but can mask what is imported, which could hide malicious code in the 'elektra' module itself. No evidence of malware or security risks from this fragment alone.",
