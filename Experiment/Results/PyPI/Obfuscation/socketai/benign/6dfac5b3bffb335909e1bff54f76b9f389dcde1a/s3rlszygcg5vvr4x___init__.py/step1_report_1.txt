{
  "purpose": "The code imports all components from the local module 'elektra', likely to use its functions or classes elsewhere in the package.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .elektra",
  "sinks": "Potentially any functions or data used later from the imported module; no direct sinks are visible in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the local 'elektra' module into the current namespace through the import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a simple import statement with no additional logic, no hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs. The import style ('*') can sometimes obscure what is being imported, but by itself, it is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement importing everything from a local module named 'elektra'. There are no other code operations, data handling, or logic present. This pattern is common in Python packages to bring in all functions, classes, or variables from a module. No malicious or suspicious behavior can be inferred from this alone. The import style ('*') is discouraged in some contexts but is not inherently malicious. The snippet provides no evidence of data leakage, code injection, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard import statement with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The code's security implications depend entirely on the content of the 'elektra' module, which is not provided here. Based solely on this line, there is no indication of malicious behavior.",
