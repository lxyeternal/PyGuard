  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code: `from .elektra import *`.\n- They agree that this is a simple import statement with no additional logic.\n- Use of wildcard import (`*`) is discouraged but not inherently malicious.\n- The actual content of the 'elektra' module is unknown, which limits definitive conclusions.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or direct signs of malware are visible.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes, all reports correctly identify that the code is just an import statement. No malicious activity is directly indicated.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- The reports correctly note that `import *` can obscure namespace and potentially hide malicious symbols, but they do not overstate this concern.\n- No incorrect assumptions are made; they acknowledge the lack of content in 'elektra'.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate given the code snippet.\n- Security risk scores are low (mostly 0.1–0.2), reflecting minimal concern, which is reasonable.\n- Confidence scores vary from 0.4 to 0.8, depending on the report's assessment of uncertainty; higher confidence in the benign nature is justified here.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- Since the code only imports everything from 'elektra', **the risk is primarily in the content of that module**, which is unknown.\n- The use of `import *` can hide malicious symbols if they exist.\n- Therefore, a **moderate risk score (around 0.2)** is appropriate, reflecting some concern but not high risk without further evidence.\n\n### Malware score:\n- Correctly set to 0 across all reports, as no malicious activity is evident from the import statement alone.\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n- No claims are made about vulnerabilities based on assumptions; the reports are cautious and acknowledge the lack of context.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** ~0.2 (due to the use of wildcard import and unknown content of 'elektra')\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThis code snippet is benign by itself. The primary concern is the content of the 'elektra' module, which could potentially contain malicious code. Without that, the import statement alone poses minimal risk.\n\n**Recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard import statement with no immediate security issues. Further review of the 'elektra' module is necessary to fully assess security implications.",
