{
  "purpose": "Import all symbols from the local 'elektra' module, likely to use its functionalities.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; actual data sources depend on 'elektra' module content.",
  "sinks": "Potentially any symbols or functions imported from 'elektra' that could be misused if malicious.",
  "flows": "Import statement loads symbols into namespace; no data flow or execution evident in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('*'), which can obscure imported symbols; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement: 'from .elektra import *'. It does not contain any logic, data handling, or suspicious constructs. The primary concern with such an import is namespace pollution and potential hiding of malicious symbols if 'elektra' is compromised. Since the content of 'elektra' is unknown, the risk assessment relies on the assumption that the module is benign. Malware score is set to 0, as no malicious activity is evident. Security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting the minimal risk of the import statement itself. Confidence in benign assessment is moderate, given the lack of context. No obfuscation is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign and does not exhibit malicious behavior. The main concern is the use of wildcard import, which can hide malicious symbols if 'elektra' is compromised, but this cannot be confirmed from the snippet alone. Overall, the security risk is minimal, and no malware is detected.",
