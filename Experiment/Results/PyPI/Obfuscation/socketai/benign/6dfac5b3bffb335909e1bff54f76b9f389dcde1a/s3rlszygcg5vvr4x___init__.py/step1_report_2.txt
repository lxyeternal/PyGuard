{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from the 'elektra' module, likely to utilize its functions or classes.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local 'elektra' module",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; depends on the imported module's usage elsewhere",
  "flows": "N/A in this snippet; the flow depends on subsequent use of imported components",
  "anomalies": "Use of a wildcard import ('*') can lead to unclear namespace and potential unintended behaviors; no suspicious or malicious code directly visible here",
  "analysis": "This code simply imports all elements from a local module named 'elektra'. The absence of further code or context prevents detailed analysis. Wildcard imports are discouraged as they can obscure which functions or variables are imported, but they are not inherently malicious. No signs of hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious activities are evident. The risk largely depends on the contents of the 'elektra' module, which is not provided here.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. However, the use of wildcard import warrants caution in broader context. No malware or security issues are detectable from this isolated line.",
