  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling",
  "sources": "Class definitions that do not read input or data from external sources",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data processing observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only defines classes",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class names, which could be an attempt to hide intent or malicious purpose",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of three class definitions that extend Exception, with non-descriptive, obfuscated class names. There is no logic, data processing, external input, or other suspicious behavior present. The obfuscated names could be for concealment, but without additional context, this alone is not indicative of malicious activity. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malware is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to only define custom exception classes with obfuscated names. There is no malicious behavior or security risk evident from this snippet alone.",
