{
  "purpose": "Define three custom exception classes with obfuscated, nonsensical names, serving as placeholder exception types.",
  "sources": "Class definitions where exception classes are declared; no input/output or data handling present.",
  "sinks": "No data flows, external interactions, or untrusted data sources; no sinks identified.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; only class declarations without logic or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class names that do not convey meaningful intent; absence of logic or data handling; minimal code structure.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines three exception classes with obfuscated names, lacking any logic, data flow, or external interactions. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not constitute malicious activity. Malware scores are correctly set to zero, and security risk scores are very low, reflecting the benign nature of class declarations. The high obfuscation scores are justified given the nonsensical class names. Confidence in benign assessment is high, but the obfuscation warrants cautious observation in future reviews.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting only of obfuscated exception class definitions with no malicious behavior or data flow. While obfuscation is suspicious, it does not indicate malicious intent in this context. Scores are consistent with the analysis, with malware and security risk scores appropriately low and obfuscation scores justified.",
