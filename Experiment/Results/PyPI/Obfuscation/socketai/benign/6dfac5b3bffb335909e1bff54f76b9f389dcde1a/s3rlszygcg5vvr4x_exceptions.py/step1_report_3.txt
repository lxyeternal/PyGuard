  "purpose": "Define three custom exception classes for error handling.",
  "sources": "None; no input or data reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leak points are present; no data flow to untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink flows as no data input or processing is present.",
  "anomalies": "The class names are highly obfuscated, consisting of nonsensical, random strings, which is unusual and suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three exception classes with intentionally obfuscated names, which could be an attempt to hide their purpose. There are no other operations, data processing, or logic present. Obfuscated class names are often used to evade detection or hide malicious intent, but on their own, these classes are harmless. Without additional code, these definitions pose no direct security risk. The obfuscation warrants caution, but the code itself does not exhibit malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code only defines three custom exception classes with obfuscated names. While the obfuscation raises suspicion, there is no evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities within this fragment. It appears to be benign, but the naming could be intentionally misleading.",
