  "purpose": "Define three custom exception classes for error handling.",
  "sources": "Class definitions; no input or data reading involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or output present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; simply class declarations with no logic.",
  "anomalies": "Class names are obfuscated and nonsensical, which could indicate malicious intent to hide purpose, but no malicious code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of three custom exception class declarations with obfuscated names. There are no data inputs, no data sinks, and no logical flows. The obfuscated class names could be an attempt to hide malicious intent, but as they are just class declarations with no behavior, there is no direct evidence of malicious activity. The absence of code logic or data handling means no malicious behavior or security risks are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "This code defines three obfuscated exception classes with no logic or data handling, which alone does not indicate malicious intent. The obfuscation could be suspicious but is not conclusive. No malware or security risks are detected.",
