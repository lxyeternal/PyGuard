  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data propagation present.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual class names that are non-descriptive and appear obfuscated; no actual behavior or logic implemented.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of three class definitions inheriting from Exception, with nonsensical class names that resemble obfuscated code. There are no functions, variables, or logic that could indicate malicious intent. The class names do not match standard naming conventions and appear intentionally obscure, which could be a sign of obfuscation or malicious concealment, but given the simplicity and lack of other suspicious activity, this is not necessarily malicious. The code does not perform any operations, data handling, or external interactions. It appears to be a minimal, possibly placeholder or obfuscated, set of exception classes.",
  "conclusion": "This code only defines three custom exception classes with obfuscated names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks. The unusual naming could be for obfuscation, but no malicious actions are present.",
