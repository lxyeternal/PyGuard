  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading points present.",
  "sinks": "No data or control flow sinks that could leak data or perform harmful actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths exist in this code.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of unusually named classes that extend Exception; no other code present.",
  "analysis": "The code only defines three custom exception classes with obfuscated, nonsensical names. No logic, data processing, or external interactions are present. The class names appear intentionally obscure but do not indicate malicious behavior; they simply serve as placeholders or obfuscated class names. There are no sources, sinks, or flows that could lead to security issues. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious activities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely consists of custom exception class definitions with obfuscated names and contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be benign and possibly intentionally obfuscated placeholder code.",
