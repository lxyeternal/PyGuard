{
  "purpose": "Define enums for different energy markets and equipment configurations, and establish a holiday calendar for scheduling.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or user inputs; enums are static, and the holiday calendar is hardcoded.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, no network operations, no database interactions, and no execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow or untrusted data handling detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; enums are simply mappings, and the holiday calendar is standard with no obfuscation or hidden logic.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of enum definitions for market identifiers, equipment types, and scheduling frequencies, along with a holiday calendar class based on pandas' AbstractHolidayCalendar. The holiday list contains standard US holidays with typical observance adjustments. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors. No external inputs or untrusted data processing are present. The code appears to be a straightforward setup for a scheduling or data processing system related to energy markets.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely defining static data structures for enums and holiday schedules. No malicious or malicious-sounding behavior is present. It seems safe for use.",
