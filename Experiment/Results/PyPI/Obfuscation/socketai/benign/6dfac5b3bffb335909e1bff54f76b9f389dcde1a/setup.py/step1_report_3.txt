  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'elektra' Python package, defining its metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description; hardcoded strings for package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data flows into vulnerable operations.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md content into variable; setting package metadata with static strings.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names such as 'nEklBDaYIKWRuyRaoRgitATvFxhqrIXn' and 'mjRmdMtmRTyvlOUsFiruYbtbDXPmfQcr' without clear purpose; inconsistent variable naming; no use of untrusted input in a security-sensitive context.",
  "analysis": "The script reads the contents of 'README.md' into a variable with an obfuscated name, then uses static strings for package configuration. The code employs non-descriptive variable names, which may be a sign of obfuscation, but no malicious logic, code injection, or suspicious behaviors are present. The script adheres to typical setup.py patterns, with no signs of secret keys, backdoors, or malicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names but no malicious intent or security risks identified. The obfuscation appears to be for non-malicious reasons such as code style or minor obfuscation, not malicious activity.",
