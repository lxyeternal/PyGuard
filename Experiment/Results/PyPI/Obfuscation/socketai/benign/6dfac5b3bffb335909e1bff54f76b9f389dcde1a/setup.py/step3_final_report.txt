{
  "purpose": "The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging the 'elektra' Python library, reading README.md for description and setting package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description; static string assignments for package metadata; no dynamic input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows, network activity, or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static assignment without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated variable names for static strings; no functional purpose for obfuscation, which reduces readability but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with obfuscated variable names. No malicious code, network activity, or data exfiltration is detected. The obfuscation appears stylistic or automated, not malicious. The static strings are used appropriately for package metadata. No security vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with obfuscation being superficial and not indicative of malicious intent. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is moderate (~0.6), and overall security risk is very low (~0.1).",
