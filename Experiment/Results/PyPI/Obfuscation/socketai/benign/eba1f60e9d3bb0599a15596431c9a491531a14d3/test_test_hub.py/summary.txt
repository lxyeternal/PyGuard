  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured test suite for OAuth token retrieval mechanisms, involving configuration files, environment variables, and directory structures. It handles various valid and invalid scenarios without any malicious activity or malware. Obfuscation is present but not indicative of malicious intent. The security risk is very low, and the malware score should be 0. The obfuscation score can be moderate to high due to naming, but this is typical in testing or proprietary code. Overall, the code poses no security threat and is purely for robustness testing."
