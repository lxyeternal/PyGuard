  "conclusion": "The code is a set of test routines manipulating environment variables and configuration files with hardcoded tokens. It does not perform malicious actions or contain obfuscation. The main security concern is insecure secret handling, which is acceptable in testing but should be addressed in production. The scores are consistent with the code's behavior, and no malicious activity is detected."
