  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test suite for token extraction with no malware or obfuscation. The primary security concern is insecure subprocess usage with 'shell=True' and untrusted input, which could lead to command injection if configuration files are compromised. Overall, the code is safe in its current context but should be reviewed for subprocess security in production."
