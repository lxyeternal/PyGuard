  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated test suite for token retrieval from environment variables. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The obfuscation is notable but not malicious. The assigned malware score is 0, and the security risk is very low (~0.1-0.2). The obfuscation score is moderate (~0.4-0.6), justified by the naming. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for its purpose."
