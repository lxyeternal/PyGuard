The obfuscation is notable but not malicious. The assigned malware score is 0, and the security risk is very low (~0.1-0.2). The obfuscation score is moderate (~0.4-0.6), justified by the naming. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for its purpose."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign test suite for token extraction with no malware or obfuscation. The primary security concern is insecure subprocess usage with 'shell=True' and untrusted input, which could lead to command injection if configuration files are compromised. Overall, the code is safe in its current context but should be reviewed for subprocess security in production."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign test setup code that manipulates environment variables to isolate the environment during testing. There is no evidence of malware or malicious behavior. The obfuscation is superficial and typical in some testing contexts. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior."

      "conclusion": "The code is a set of test routines manipulating environment variables and configuration files with hardcoded tokens. It does not perform malicious actions or contain obfuscation. The main security concern is insecure secret handling, which is acceptable in testing but should be addressed in production. The scores are consistent with the code's behavior, and no malicious activity is detected."

The malware score is 0, the obfuscation score is high (~0.75), and the security risk score is low (~0.2). The obfuscation warrants a higher obfuscated score, but overall, the code poses minimal security threat."

It handles various valid and invalid scenarios without any malicious activity or malware. Obfuscation is present but not indicative of malicious intent. The security risk is very low, and the malware score should be 0. The obfuscation score can be moderate to high due to naming, but this is typical in testing or proprietary code. Overall, the code poses no security threat and is purely for robustness testing."

While obfuscation and subprocess calls could be misused in a malicious context, the current analysis shows no evidence of malware. The security risk is low, and the scores should reflect the potential for misuse rather than actual malicious activity."
