      "conclusion": "The code is benign, functioning as a standard setup script. The primary concern is reliance on an external 'requirements.txt' that could be malicious if compromised, but this is a supply chain risk, not malicious code within the script itself. The malware score remains 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk score around 0.2 are appropriate. No modifications or further alerts are necessary."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for encoding and writing data to files, obfuscated to conceal its purpose. It does not contain malware or active vulnerabilities but has some security concerns related to input validation and obfuscation. The overall assessment indicates low malware risk, high obfuscation, and moderate security risk, consistent with the provided reports."
