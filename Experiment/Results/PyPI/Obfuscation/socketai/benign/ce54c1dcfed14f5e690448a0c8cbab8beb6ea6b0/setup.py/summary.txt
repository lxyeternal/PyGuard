  "conclusion": "The code is benign, functioning as a standard setup script. The primary concern is reliance on an external 'requirements.txt' that could be malicious if compromised, but this is a supply chain risk, not malicious code within the script itself. The malware score remains 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk score around 0.2 are appropriate. No modifications or further alerts are necessary."
