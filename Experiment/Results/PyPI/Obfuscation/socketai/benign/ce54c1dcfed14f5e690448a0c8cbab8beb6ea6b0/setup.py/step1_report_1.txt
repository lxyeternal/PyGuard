  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'write' with dependencies read from 'requirements.txt'.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'requirements.txt' file to obtain dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; the code primarily loads dependencies for setup.",
  "flows": "Reads 'requirements.txt' -> passes dependencies to 'install_requires' parameter.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'open' to read dependencies dynamically at setup time is unusual but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setuptools.setup' with package details. It reads dependencies from 'requirements.txt' file. The approach is standard for setup scripts but reading dependencies directly from a file at setup time is less common; however, it does not imply malicious intent. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. The approach to reading dependencies is slightly unconventional but benign.",
