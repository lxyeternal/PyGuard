  "purpose": "Setuptools configuration for packaging a Python project named 'write'.",
  "sources": "Reading 'requirements.txt' to determine dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data is used directly in a way that leads to data leaks or execution.",
  "flows": "No significant source-to-sink data flows present.",
  "anomalies": "Using 'open' to read 'requirements.txt' directly within setup; potential for misuse if the file path is manipulated, but this is common in setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls its setup() function to configure the package. It reads 'requirements.txt' to specify dependencies dynamically. This is a standard practice in Python packaging. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The method of reading dependencies is straightforward and not inherently malicious. No obfuscated code, suspicious network activity, or malicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for a Python package and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The use of reading 'requirements.txt' directly is common, with no signs of tampering or malicious intent.",
