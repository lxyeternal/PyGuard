  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script that reads dependencies from 'requirements.txt' during installation.",
  "sources": "Reading 'requirements.txt' file at setup time via open().read().splitlines()",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; potential concern if 'requirements.txt' is maliciously altered, but no malicious code present.",
  "flows": "Source: open('requirements.txt') -> read() -> splitlines() used in install_requires parameter",
  "anomalies": "Unconventional dependency loading pattern; no error handling for file access; no validation of 'requirements.txt'.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with minimal complexity. It reads dependencies dynamically, which is common but can be risky if the file is compromised. No malicious code, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are detected. The malware score is 0, consistent with the absence of malicious activity. The security risk score is low (~0.2), reflecting the potential for dependency tampering but not an active threat. The code's straightforward nature and the lack of suspicious signals support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, functioning as a standard setup script. The primary concern is reliance on an external 'requirements.txt' that could be malicious if compromised, but this is a supply chain risk, not malicious code within the script itself. The malware score remains 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk score around 0.2 are appropriate. No modifications or further alerts are necessary.",
