  "purpose": "Conditional import of datetime functions from either udatetime._pure or udatetime.rfc3339 based on the presence of __pypy__.",
  "sources": "Import statement checking for __pypy__, and subsequent imports from udatetime modules.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks detected; no external network or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "Conditional import flow depending on the presence of __pypy__, leading to different module imports.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names (e.g., SfHtmiJBLaTlAZnPlGAnbexqMRyZMBiM, bxhyjyWOvvSCahfSZwqZuCLIkXxwSkdw), and the code does not reveal explicit malicious intent. The variable names are intentionally obscure, which could be suspicious in some contexts, but are consistent with a dynamic import pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports datetime functions from different modules based on the presence of the __pypy__ module, indicating environment-specific behavior. The import paths involve obfuscated variable names, but the imported functions themselves are standard datetime utilities (e.g., from_string, to_string, utcfromtimestamp). No external network access, credential handling, or data processing occurs. The obfuscation appears to be a code style choice rather than malicious activity. Overall, the code is a typical environment check with modular imports, not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs environment-based module imports with obfuscated variable names but no malicious behavior or security risks are evident. It appears to be a standard conditional import pattern, with obfuscation possibly for code concealment or stylistic reasons.",
