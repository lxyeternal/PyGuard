  "purpose": "Performs environment detection via __pypy__ and conditionally imports datetime utility functions from either udatetime._pure or udatetime.rfc3339, exposing standard datetime functions.",
  "sources": "Checks for __pypy__ environment variable; imports functions from either udatetime._pure or udatetime.rfc3339 modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data sinks; purely imports functions for internal use.",
  "flows": "Environment check leads to conditional import of datetime functions; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names for imported modules and functions; no malicious code or external effects.",
  "analysis": "The code detects if running under PyPy by checking __pypy__, then imports datetime utility functions accordingly. The variable names are intentionally obfuscated, but the imported functions are standard datetime utilities. There are no external data flows, network operations, or malicious behaviors. The obfuscation appears stylistic or for concealment, not malicious. The code's purpose is environment-specific setup, common in cross-platform modules. No vulnerabilities or malicious actions are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign environment detection and import setup with superficial obfuscation. No malicious activity or security vulnerabilities are present. The obfuscation is likely stylistic, not malicious. The overall security risk is minimal, and the malware score should be 0.",
