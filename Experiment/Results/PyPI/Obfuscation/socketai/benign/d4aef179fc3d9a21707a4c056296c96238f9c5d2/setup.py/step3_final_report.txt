  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for package configuration, dependency management, and optional C extension compilation based on environment detection.",
  "sources": "Reads external files (requirements.txt, version.txt, README.md), environment variables, and system info.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or network operations; file reads are benign; environment variables are used as flags.",
  "flows": "Reads files -> sets environment flags -> conditionally compiles extension -> calls setup() with metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, high obfuscation scores in some reports, conditional extension compilation based on environment detection.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with environment detection and optional C extension compilation. Variable names are intentionally obscure but not malicious. No network activity, credential handling, or malicious payloads are present. Obfuscation is stylistic or for concealment but does not indicate malicious intent. The environment variable and conditional logic are standard for cross-platform or interpreter-specific extensions. No signs of sabotage or malware are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate setup configuration with obfuscated variable names that could be stylistic. No malicious activity or malware detected. The obfuscation scores are justified given the variable naming, but overall, the code appears benign and typical for such setup scripts.",
