  "conclusion": "The code functions as a datetime utility library with heavy obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious activity or malware. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not demonstrate malicious intent based on current analysis. The malware score should be 0, with a high obfuscation score (~0.8), and a low to moderate security risk (~0.5) due to obfuscation but benign functionality."
