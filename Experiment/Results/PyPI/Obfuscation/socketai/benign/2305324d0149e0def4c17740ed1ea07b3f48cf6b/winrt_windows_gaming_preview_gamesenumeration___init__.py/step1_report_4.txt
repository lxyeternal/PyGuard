{
  "purpose": "Define enumerations and type aliases related to Windows gaming system API interfaces, likely for use in a larger application.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (enum, typing, uuid, winrt), and defines enums and type aliases. No direct input reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs, no untrusted data handling, no network or file operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code primarily defines enums and type aliases.",
  "anomalies": "The enum class names appear obfuscated (e.g., niJdSbnJqxZgcCEfMjoEooIrjePvubzp), and variable names are non-descriptive, suggesting obfuscation. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and Windows Runtime interfaces. It defines several enums with obfuscated names and a few type aliases for callables. The enums have nonsensical names and members, indicating possible code obfuscation but no malicious behavior. No data leaks, no suspicious network activity, and no malicious functions are present. The code appears to be part of a larger, possibly obfuscated, codebase related to Windows gaming API integrations.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily consists of obfuscated enum definitions and type aliases without any malicious behavior or security risks. No suspicious activity or malware indicators are present.",
