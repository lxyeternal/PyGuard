{
  "purpose": "Defines enums and type aliases related to Windows gaming APIs, with obfuscated class names.",
  "sources": "Enum class definitions, import statements, type alias assignments",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, external communications, or data processing observed",
  "flows": "None; code only contains type and enum definitions without data flow",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated class and variable names; no functional logic or data handling",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of enum definitions and type aliases with obfuscated names, imported modules that are legitimate, and no active logic or data flows. The obfuscation suggests either auto-generated code or intentional concealment, but there is no evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection. The malware score is appropriately zero, and the high obfuscation score reflects the naming pattern. Risk is low due to lack of active threats, with a slight increase due to obfuscation. Confidence in benign assessment is high.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with obfuscation likely for code protection or auto-generation purposes. No malicious activity or security risks are evident. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with this analysis, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.8,
