  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of utility functions with superficial obfuscation, no malicious payloads, and low security risk. The high obfuscation score reflects variable naming complexity, but no active malicious behavior is detected. Overall, the supply chain risk is minimal, though obfuscation warrants cautious deployment."
