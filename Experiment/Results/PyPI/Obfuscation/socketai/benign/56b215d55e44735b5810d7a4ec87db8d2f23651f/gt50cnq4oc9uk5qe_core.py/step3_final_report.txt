  "sources": "Function parameters, data structures being iterated over.",
  "sinks": "Recursive calls, validation checks, potential data filtering.",
  "flows": "Data is validated and filtered through recursive traversal; no external network or system calls.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, error suppression, recursive complexity that could conceal malicious intent but no explicit malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions that perform data validation, type checking, error handling, and recursive traversal. Variable names are intentionally obscure, and error suppression is used to mask potential issues. No network activity, system modifications, or data exfiltration observed. The recursive functions could be exploited to hide malicious payloads, but no such activity is evident. The obfuscation and complexity are typical of utility libraries and do not necessarily indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of utility functions with superficial obfuscation, no malicious payloads, and low security risk. The high obfuscation score reflects variable naming complexity, but no active malicious behavior is detected. Overall, the supply chain risk is minimal, though obfuscation warrants cautious deployment.",
