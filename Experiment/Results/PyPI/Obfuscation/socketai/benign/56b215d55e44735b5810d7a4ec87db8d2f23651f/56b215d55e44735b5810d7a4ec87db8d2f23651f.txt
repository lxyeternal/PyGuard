      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign module interface with obfuscated internal identifiers. While obfuscation can conceal malicious code, there is no concrete evidence here. Further review of the .core module is recommended to confirm safety. The current scores are appropriate, but slight adjustments to malware and risk scores (e.g., malware=0.2, risk=0.3) could better reflect the suspicion introduced by obfuscation."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of utility functions with superficial obfuscation, no malicious payloads, and low security risk. The high obfuscation score reflects variable naming complexity, but no active malicious behavior is detected. Overall, the supply chain risk is minimal, though obfuscation warrants cautious deployment."
