{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define an import structure and exposes certain identifiers for external use, possibly part of a package's __init__.py.",
  "sources": "Import statements from a local module (.core). The version string assignment.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network, file, or system commands are present. No untrusted data handling is evident.",
  "flows": "The imported symbols are exposed via __all__, and the version string is assigned to a variable, which could be used elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "The imported identifiers are obfuscated or nonsensical, indicating potential code obfuscation or malicious intent. The import source (.core) is local, but the names do not reveal functionality. The version string is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several obfuscated symbols from a local module, which could hide malicious behavior or simply be an obfuscation technique. The version string is standard. The lack of explicit code execution or data handling reduces immediate concern, but the obfuscated names suggest possible concealment. No network, file, or environment manipulation is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily sets up package exports and imports obscure symbols from a local module. While obfuscation could be benign, the unusual symbol names warrant caution. No direct malicious activity is evident in this fragment, but the obfuscated identifiers could be used maliciously elsewhere.",
