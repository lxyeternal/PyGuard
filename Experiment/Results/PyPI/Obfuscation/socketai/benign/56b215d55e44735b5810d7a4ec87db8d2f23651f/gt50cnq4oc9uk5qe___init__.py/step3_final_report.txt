  "purpose": "Import obfuscated symbols from a local module and define package exports along with a version string.",
  "sources": "Import statements from .core module, assignment of version string",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "Import symbols from .core, expose selected identifiers via __all__",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated or nonsensical symbol names, unusual variable name for version string",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple symbols with obfuscated names from a local module, assigns a version string, and defines __all__ for exports. No active malicious activity, network access, or data leakage is evident. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. The scores across reports are consistent, with high obfuscation scores and low malware/risk scores, reflecting cautious suspicion due to obfuscation but no direct evidence of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign module interface with obfuscated internal identifiers. While obfuscation can conceal malicious code, there is no concrete evidence here. Further review of the .core module is recommended to confirm safety. The current scores are appropriate, but slight adjustments to malware and risk scores (e.g., malware=0.2, risk=0.3) could better reflect the suspicion introduced by obfuscation.",
