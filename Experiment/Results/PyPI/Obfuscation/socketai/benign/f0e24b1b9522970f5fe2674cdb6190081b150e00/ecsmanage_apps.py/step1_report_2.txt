  "purpose": "Define a Django application configuration class with obfuscated class and attribute names.",
  "sources": "The class definition and the assignment of string values to class attributes.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not interact with external systems or untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Class initialization flow with static string assignments; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Class and attribute names are intentionally obfuscated, which is suspicious but not inherently malicious; no other unusual behavior or hardcoded secrets evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django AppConfig subclass with a non-descriptive class name and attributes assigned string values that seem unrelated to typical configuration. The obfuscation could be benign (e.g., trying to hide implementation details) or malicious (concealing malicious intent). There are no signs of malicious activity such as network connections, data exfiltration, or code injection. The static strings do not appear sensitive or hardcoded credentials, and the code's purpose seems limited to configuration. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not confirm malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is obfuscated but does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks in its current form. The obfuscation may be suspicious but is not inherently malicious. No security issues detected.",
