  "purpose": "Static Django AppConfig subclass with obfuscated class and attribute names, containing fixed string values related to ECS management.",
  "sources": "Static string assignments to class attributes; no external input or dynamic data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows, network activity, or external interactions detected.",
  "flows": "None; static assignments without data flow or external influence.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and attribute names; no functional logic or dynamic behavior; only static configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django AppConfig subclass with nonsensical, obfuscated identifiers and fixed string values. No external input, network activity, or code execution occurs. The obfuscation may be suspicious but is not inherently malicious. The static strings are benign. The code's simplicity and lack of dynamic behavior justify low malware and security risk scores. The obfuscation scores are high due to nonsensical identifiers, which is consistent with the reports. No vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident from static analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static, obfuscated Django configuration class with no malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The high obfuscation scores are justified but do not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code is benign, and the reported scores are appropriate.",
