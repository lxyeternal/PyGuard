{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform some form of data processing or utility functions, but without additional context or documentation, the specific purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters, environment variables, or imported modules. No obvious untrusted input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data via print statements, logging, or writes to files or network connections. No clear suspicious sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Data flows from inputs or environment variables through processing functions to outputs or storage, but no malicious source-to-sink paths are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious function names, or obfuscated code observed. No unusual or malicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, utilizing standard Python libraries and practices. No signs of malware, such as network communication to suspicious domains, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The lack of complex or obfuscated constructs suggests normal functionality. Absence of input validation or sanitization is noted but does not constitute malicious intent by itself. Overall, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided content.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code appears benign, with no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security vulnerabilities. It is likely a legitimate utility or processing script with standard patterns.",
