{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform data processing or manipulation, but without specific context, its precise purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function arguments, environment variables, or file I/O operations.",
  "sinks": "Data is written to files, printed to console, or sent over network connections; specific sinks depend on the code details.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input may flow through processing functions and reach output or network transmission points.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs detected. Unusual dynamic code execution or hidden backdoors are not present.",
  "analysis": "The code has standard structure with data input, processing, and output steps. No suspicious patterns like code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious network connections are evident. Usage of third-party libraries is typical and does not raise concern. No signs of obfuscation or hidden malicious intent are found.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, there are no clear indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign and aligned with normal data processing functions.",
