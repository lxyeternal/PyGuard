  "purpose": "Review open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on suspicious patterns, obfuscation, and malicious payloads.",
  "sources": "Input data from code variables, environment variables, network calls, eval/exec functions, hardcoded strings, and file I/O.",
  "sinks": "Potential data exfiltration points, network connections, file modifications, or execution of malicious payloads.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as input variables or environment variables through processing functions to sinks like network calls or file writes, possibly via eval/exec or dynamic imports.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscation, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), hardcoded secrets, unusual variable naming, or incomplete code snippets.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution in Report 2, which justifies a moderate suspicion level. Reports 1, 3, 4, and 5 show benign or insufficient code, aligning with low malware and risk scores. The scores are consistent with the described behaviors; Report 2's higher obfuscation and dynamic features justify a malware score around 0.4-0.5 and a security risk of 0.6. The other reports' low scores reflect their benign nature. No evidence of malicious payloads or exfiltration is confirmed in any report, and obfuscation is only present in Report 2.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with low security risk; Report 2 shows suspicious obfuscation and dynamic code features but lacks confirmed malicious payloads. Scores are appropriate; a slight increase in malware score for Report 2 to 0.5 could be justified if further evidence confirms malicious intent.",
