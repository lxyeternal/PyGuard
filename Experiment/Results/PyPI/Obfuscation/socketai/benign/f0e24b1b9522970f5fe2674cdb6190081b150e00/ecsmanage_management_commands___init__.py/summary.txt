  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with low security risk; Report 2 shows suspicious obfuscation and dynamic code features but lacks confirmed malicious payloads. Scores are appropriate; a slight increase in malware score for Report 2 to 0.5 could be justified if further evidence confirms malicious intent."
