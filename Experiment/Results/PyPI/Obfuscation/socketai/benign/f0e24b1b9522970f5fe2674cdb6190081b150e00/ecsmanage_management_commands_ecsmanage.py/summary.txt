  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, albeit heavily obfuscated, AWS ECS management utility. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The primary concern is the obfuscation, which complicates review and could potentially conceal malicious intent if present. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware remains at zero. The overall security risk is moderate due to obfuscation and incomplete code snippets, warranting cautious review before deployment."
