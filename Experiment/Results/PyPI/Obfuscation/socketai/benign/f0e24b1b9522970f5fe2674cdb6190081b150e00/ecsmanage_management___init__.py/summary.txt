  "conclusion": "Most code dependencies show low to moderate suspicion, with report 5 highlighting significant obfuscation and dynamic features suggestive of potential malicious intent. The current scoring system accurately reflects these observations. Continued vigilance is recommended, especially for packages exhibiting obfuscation and dynamic code execution, to prevent supply chain compromises."
