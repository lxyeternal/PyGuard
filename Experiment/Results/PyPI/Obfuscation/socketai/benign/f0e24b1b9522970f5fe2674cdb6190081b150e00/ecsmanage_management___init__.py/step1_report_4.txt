  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be a Python script that could be used for data processing, web requests, or other general functions, depending on the omitted code.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input functions, environment variables, or possibly external files or network sources, though specifics are not visible.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writing, or executing dynamic code, but the exact points are not specified due to lack of code visibility.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as input or environment variables to sinks like network or file system, but the precise flow paths cannot be determined without code details.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies are detected from the provided code snippet; however, the absence of context limits full assessment.",
  "analysis": "Without actual code, the analysis cannot identify specific source-to-sink flows or anomalies. There are no visible suspicious patterns such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious API calls. The structure appears standard, but the lack of code prevents detailed evaluation.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of code, no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks can be identified. The snippet appears benign but is incomplete for thorough assessment.",
