{
  "purpose": "The code appears to implement a data processing or utility function, but without explicit comments or context, the exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from standard input or variables assigned within the code.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes data to files, prints output, or sends data over the network (if such operations are present).",
  "flows": "Data flows from source points (input variables or external input) through processing functions to output or network transmission points.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code snippets detected. The code contains standard Python constructs; no obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code reads input data (if any) and processes it through functions or methods, with no evident insecure practices such as unsafe SQL or system calls. It does not exhibit behaviors like network connections to suspicious domains, data exfiltration, or system damage routines. The code structure and variable usage appear normal. Without specific external dependencies or hidden code, there are no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain sabotage, or security risks. The code seems benign with no suspicious patterns or backdoors detected.",
