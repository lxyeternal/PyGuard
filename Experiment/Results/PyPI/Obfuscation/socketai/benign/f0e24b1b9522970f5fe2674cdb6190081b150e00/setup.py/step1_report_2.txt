  "purpose": "Configure package setup with versioning managed by SCM (Source Control Management).",
  "sources": "The 'setuptools' module import and 'setup' function call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; setup function parameters are static and controlled.",
  "flows": "Import of 'setuptools' (source) to execution of 'setup' with 'use_scm_version=True' (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code with straightforward setup; no suspicious dynamic code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'setuptools' library and calls the 'setup' function with 'use_scm_version=True', indicating reliance on SCM for versioning. No user input, environment variables, or external data is processed. The code is minimal and standard for package configuration, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical setup script for Python packaging using setuptools with SCM versioning. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks present.",
