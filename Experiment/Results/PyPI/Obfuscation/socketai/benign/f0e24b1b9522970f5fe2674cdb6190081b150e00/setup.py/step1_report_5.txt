  "purpose": "Configure package setup using setuptools with source control management versioning.",
  "sources": "Import statement for setuptools and the setup() function call with use_scm_version parameter.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or data.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks is present.",
  "anomalies": "Use of use_scm_version=True indicates reliance on version control system for versioning, which is common in package configuration. No suspicious code or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'setuptools' library and calls the setup() function with a parameter that enables source control management (SCM) versioning. This is a standard practice for dynamic versioning based on version control metadata. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity. The minimal code serves a typical purpose in Python packaging.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup configuration for a Python package, utilizing SCM for versioning. There are no indications of malicious intent, security risks, or anomalies.",
