  "purpose": "Configure package setup with version control via SCM (Source Control Management).",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration data for package setup from the setuptools library and the use_scm_version parameter.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that handle untrusted input or could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "The setup function uses the use_scm_version parameter to determine the versioning scheme; there are no external data flows or untrusted data sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is minimal and follows standard setup configuration practices.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup with the parameter use_scm_version set to True. This instructs setuptools to automatically determine the package version based on SCM metadata (like git tags). This is a common, legitimate practice in Python packaging. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code does not perform any data processing, network communication, or other potentially malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration snippet that enables versioning from SCM metadata. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies.",
