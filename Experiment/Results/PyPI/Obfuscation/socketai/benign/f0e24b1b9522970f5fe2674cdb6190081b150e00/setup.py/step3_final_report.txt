  "purpose": "Configure Python package setup with SCM-based versioning.",
  "sources": "Import of 'setup' from 'setuptools'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external data sources; no data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "Import of 'setup' leads to calling 'setup(use_scm_version=True)'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script utilizing setuptools with SCM versioning. It involves no user input, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscation. The use of 'use_scm_version=True' is a common practice for version management. No suspicious behavior, malicious activity, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and clarity support a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and security risk score of 0. The minor concern about SCM hooks is outside the scope of this code, and the environment's trustworthiness is assumed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and poses no security threat. All reports correctly identify it as safe, with appropriate scoring. No adjustments are necessary.",
