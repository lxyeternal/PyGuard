  "sources": "Import statement for setuptools and use_scm_version parameter in setup()",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; setup configuration is standard for packaging",
  "flows": "Imports setuptools -> calls setup() with use_scm_version=True",
  "anomalies": "Use of use_scm_version=True may trigger version management scripts, but is a standard practice; no hardcoded secrets or unusual code present",
  "analysis": "The code imports the setuptools library and calls the setup() function with the parameter use_scm_version set to True. This instructs setuptools to derive the package version from SCM (Source Control Management) metadata, such as git tags. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as executing untrusted code, network activity, or code obfuscation. The use of use_scm_version is a common pattern for automated versioning, not inherently suspicious. The code is minimal and standard for package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools with SCM-based versioning. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
