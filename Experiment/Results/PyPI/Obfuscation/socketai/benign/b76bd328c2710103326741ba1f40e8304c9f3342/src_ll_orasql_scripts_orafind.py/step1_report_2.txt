  "purpose": "No purpose can be determined as the code is only a shebang and encoding declaration with no executable content.",
  "sources": "None present; no data input or reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists as there are no operations or instructions.",
  "anomalies": "Code consists solely of shebang and encoding declaration, no logic or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, containing only the shebang line ('#!/usr/bin/env python') and encoding declaration ('# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-'). It lacks any executable statements, functions, imports, or data handling. This pattern is common in scripts but in itself does not pose any security risk or malicious behavior. No source, sink, or flow of data is present. There are no anomalies or signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely boilerplate with no executable logic or suspicious content. There is no malware or security risk present based on this fragment.",
