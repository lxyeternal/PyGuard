  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Content of the code snippets:**  \n   All reports correctly identify that the provided code is solely a shebang line and an encoding declaration, with no executable logic, functions, imports, or data handling. This minimal content is standard boilerplate in Python scripts and poses no security risk by itself.\n\n2. **Presence of malicious behavior or obfuscation:**  \n   All reports agree that there is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or suspicious activity within these fragments. The code snippets are benign and typical for script headers.\n\n3. **Scores assigned by the reports:**  \n   - **Confidence:** All reports have a confidence score of 1, which is appropriate given the clear and minimal nature of the code.  \n   - **Obfuscated:** All are 0, which makes sense since there is no code to obfuscate.  \n   - **Malware:** All are 0, consistent with the absence of malicious content.  \n   - **SecurityRisk:** All are 0, which aligns with the content's benign nature.\n\n4. **Logical consistency and reasoning:**  \n   The reports are consistent and correctly interpret the code fragment. They do not overstate potential risks or suggest vulnerabilities where none exist.\n\n5. **Potential issues or assumptions:**  \n   Since these are just headers, there are no assumptions about malicious intent. The reports correctly identify the lack of any executable or suspicious content.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** Given the code is just headers, the malware score should remain **0**.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** Also **0**, as there's no obfuscation present.  \n- **Risk score:** Since there's no evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious activity, a **0** is appropriate.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n\n- If these snippets are part of larger scripts, the security posture depends on the rest of the code. But based solely on these headers, there's no security concern.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type        | Final Estimated Score | Justification                                              |\n|-------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0                       | No malicious behavior detected in headers.                  |\n| Obfuscated        | 0                       | No obfuscation present.                                       |\n| Security Risk     | 0                       | No vulnerabilities or suspicious activity evident.          |\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and reasonable. The code snippets are benign boilerplate headers with no security implications.",
