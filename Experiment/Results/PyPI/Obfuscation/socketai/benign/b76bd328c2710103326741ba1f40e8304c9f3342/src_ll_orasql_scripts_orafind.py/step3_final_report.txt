  "purpose": "Minimal header declarations (shebang and encoding) with no executable code or data handling.",
  "sources": "None; only headers present, no input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow; code contains only static headers.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a shebang line and an encoding declaration, with no functions, logic, or data handling. All reports correctly identify the code as benign boilerplate. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate given the minimal content. No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious intent is evident. The code fragment does not pose any security risk in isolation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless boilerplate headers with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications are necessary.",
