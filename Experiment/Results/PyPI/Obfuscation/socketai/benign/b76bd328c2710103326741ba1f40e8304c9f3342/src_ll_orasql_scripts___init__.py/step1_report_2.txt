{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform a specific task, possibly related to data processing or utility functions, but it is not explicitly clear due to lack of comments or documentation.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables, function parameters, and possibly external modules or files (if any are used).",
  "sinks": "The code writes to console, logs, or external systems; it may also execute commands or write to files based on untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or function inputs to outputs such as logs or external commands; untrusted data may be processed and subsequently used in sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "There are no obvious hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns; however, any dynamic execution, unsafe use of eval or exec, or hidden network communications would be concerning. The code lacks comments, making interpretation challenging.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and defines functions that process input data. It does not demonstrate suspicious behavior such as network connections, file modifications, or credential handling. The absence of obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or unusual constructs suggests normal behavior. Without more context or external modules, no malicious patterns are evident. The code structure is straightforward, with no hidden backdoors or backchannel communications apparent. However, the lack of comments or documentation limits thorough understanding.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no clear signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code appears benign, with no suspicious patterns detected. Due to limited context, confidence is moderate, but no malicious indicators are present.",
  "confidence": 0.75,
  "obfuscated": 0,
