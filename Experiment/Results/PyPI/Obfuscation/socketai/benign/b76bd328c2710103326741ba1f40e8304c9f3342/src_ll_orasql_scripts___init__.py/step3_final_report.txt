{
  "purpose": "The code is primarily composed of import statements and simple data manipulations, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. It appears to serve as a benign utility or data processing script.",
  "sources": "Import statements, data manipulation functions, environment variable reads (if any), input data sources",
  "sinks": "Data outputs, logs, environment variables, network connections (none observed), file writes (none observed)",
  "flows": "Input data or environment variables -> processing functions -> output or environment modifications",
  "anomalies": "Absence of obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, network activity, or suspicious constructs; code is straightforward and minimal",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard import statements and simple data manipulations. No network connections, credential handling, or obfuscated code are present. The absence of suspicious patterns, such as eval/exec or network activity, indicates benign behavior. The confidence in this assessment is high (0.9), given the straightforward nature of the code. No anomalies or malicious indicators are detected. The overall security risk is minimal (0.2), reflecting a low likelihood of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code content. No further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
