{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a minimal script header, specifying the interpreter and encoding, with no executable logic.",
  "sources": "Shebang line (`#!/usr/bin/env python`) and encoding comment (`# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-`)",
  "sinks": "None; no data input/output or external calls present",
  "flows": "No data flows; only static header information",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, functions, variables, or data processing; no anomalies detected",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a shebang and encoding declaration, with no logic or external interactions. All reports correctly identify this as benign boilerplate. No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious activity is present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of executable content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The assessments and scores across all reports are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
