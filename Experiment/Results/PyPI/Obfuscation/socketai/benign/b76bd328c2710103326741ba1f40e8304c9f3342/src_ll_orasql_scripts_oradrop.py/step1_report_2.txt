  "analysis": "The provided code is minimal, containing only the shebang line indicating execution via the environment's Python interpreter and a UTF-8 encoding comment. There are no functions, variables, input/output operations, or imported modules. No data sources, sinks, or flows are present. Without any executable or logical code, there is no indication of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks.",
