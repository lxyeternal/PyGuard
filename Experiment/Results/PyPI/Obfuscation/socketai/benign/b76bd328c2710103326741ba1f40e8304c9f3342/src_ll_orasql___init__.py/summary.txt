  "conclusion": "While no explicit malware or malicious payloads are detected, the code's obfuscation, dynamic SQL generation, and schema modification functions pose significant security risks if misused. The high obfuscation and potential for schema abuse justify a cautious approach. The scores are consistent with the code's characteristics, but the overall risk warrants careful validation and input sanitization before deployment."
