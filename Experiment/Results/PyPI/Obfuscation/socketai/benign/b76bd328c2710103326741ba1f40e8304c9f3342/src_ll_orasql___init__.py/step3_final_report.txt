  "purpose": "A complex Oracle schema management and introspection utility with capabilities for schema analysis, modification, and object retrieval, heavily obfuscated with dynamic SQL generation and placeholder methods.",
  "sources": "Queries from Oracle system views (e.g., all_objects, all_constraints, all_tab_columns) and class attributes, often involving string concatenation or formatting.",
  "sinks": "Execution of dynamically generated SQL commands for schema modifications, object creation/dropping, and introspection, which could be dangerous if inputs are untrusted.",
  "flows": "Data flows from system catalog queries into SQL command strings, sometimes via string concatenation or formatting, then executed to alter or inspect database schema objects.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with complex class hierarchies, placeholder methods marked @misc.notimplemented, placeholder strings, and placeholder functions that are not fully implemented or contain dummy code.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a schema management utility for Oracle databases, with functions to generate DDL statements, retrieve object metadata, and perform schema alterations. The heavy obfuscation and placeholder methods suggest potential hiding of malicious intent, but no active malicious payloads or network activity are evident. The dynamic SQL generation, if used improperly with untrusted input, could lead to injection or schema corruption. The scores reflect high obfuscation (0.8), low active malware (0.2), and moderate to high potential risk (0.6), justified by the schema modification capabilities and obfuscation complexity.",
  "conclusion": "While no explicit malware or malicious payloads are detected, the code's obfuscation, dynamic SQL generation, and schema modification functions pose significant security risks if misused. The high obfuscation and potential for schema abuse justify a cautious approach. The scores are consistent with the code's characteristics, but the overall risk warrants careful validation and input sanitization before deployment.",
