  "purpose": "This code serves as a minimal script header, providing the shebang and encoding declaration, with no executable logic or data handling.",
  "sources": "None; the code contains only comments and metadata headers.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or untrusted data processing are present.",
  "flows": "None; no source-to-sink data flows exist.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward, with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a shebang line and a UTF-8 encoding comment, with no functions, variables, imports, or executable statements. All reviews correctly identify its benign nature. The absence of any data sources, sinks, or flows indicates no security risks or malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content. No anomalies or obfuscation are present, and the code does not pose any threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal script header with no executable or malicious content. All assessments and scores are accurate; no further action or concern is necessary.",
