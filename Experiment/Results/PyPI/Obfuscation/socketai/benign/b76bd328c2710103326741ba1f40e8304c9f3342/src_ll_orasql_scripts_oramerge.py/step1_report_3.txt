  "purpose": "This code appears to be a shebang line and encoding declaration, likely serving as the header for a Python script.",
  "sources": "No data sources or input mechanisms are present in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident in this minimal code segment.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of a shebang and encoding comment; there are no suspicious or unusual elements.",
  "analysis": "The code only includes a shebang ('#!/usr/bin/env python') and an encoding declaration ('# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-'). These are standard headers used in Python scripts to specify execution environment and character encoding. No executable logic, data handling, or external interactions are present. Therefore, there are no security concerns or malicious behaviors observable from this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard script header with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain any code that could be exploited or used maliciously.",
