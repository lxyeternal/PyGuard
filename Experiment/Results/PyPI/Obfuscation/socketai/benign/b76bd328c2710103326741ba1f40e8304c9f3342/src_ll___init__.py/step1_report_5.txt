  "purpose": "Declare namespace for a Python package to allow sub-packages to be distributed under the same distribution name.",
  "sources": "The import statement that loads 'pkg_resources' to declare namespace.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from input sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __import__ with a string, but this is standard in namespace declaration; no unusual or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to declare a namespace package using pkg_resources. If an exception occurs, it silently passes. This pattern is common for namespace packages in Python to support modular distributions. There are no hardcoded secrets, malicious functions, or suspicious behavior present. The code is minimal and straightforward, serving a standard purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard namespace declaration for Python packages, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It does not perform any harmful actions or suspicious operations.",
