  "purpose": "Declare the current package as a namespace package for distribution purposes.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or output.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow paths are present.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a broad exception to suppress errors during namespace declaration; no other unusual or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to declare a namespace package using pkg_resources. If an exception occurs, it is silently ignored. This pattern is typical in namespace package setups to avoid breaking on missing pkg_resources or unsupported environments. No malicious behaviors, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors, are present. The code is minimal and standard for namespace declarations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard boilerplate for namespace package declaration with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
