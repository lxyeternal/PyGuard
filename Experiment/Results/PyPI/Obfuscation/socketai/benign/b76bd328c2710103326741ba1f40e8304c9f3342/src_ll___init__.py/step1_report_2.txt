  "purpose": "Declare namespace package for a Python module.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; the code imports 'pkg_resources' and declares a namespace.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing, output, or external data transmission.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the code only declares a namespace.",
  "anomalies": "The use of __import__ with 'pkg_resources' to declare a namespace is standard in namespace packages, but the try-except block suppresses any import errors silently, which could be suspicious if used to hide issues. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to declare a namespace package using __import__('pkg_resources').declare_namespace(__name__). If an exception occurs during import, it is silently ignored. This pattern is common in namespace packages to support modular distributions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious operations. The silent exception handling could be a concern if it hides errors, but it is not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal, standard namespace declaration snippet. It does not perform any malicious actions or contain malicious behavior. The silent exception handling is a common pattern in namespace packages but should be used cautiously. Overall, no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
