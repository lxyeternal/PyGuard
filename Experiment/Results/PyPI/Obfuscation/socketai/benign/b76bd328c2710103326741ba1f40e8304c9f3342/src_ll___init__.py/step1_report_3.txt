  "sources": "No input or data reading detected in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data processing detected.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks, as the code only declares namespace.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for namespace declaration; no suspicious or unusual code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to declare a namespace using pkg_resources, with a fallback to ignore exceptions. This is a common pattern in namespace packaging. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities are present. The code does not handle inputs or perform operations that could be exploited. It is standard package setup code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace declaration snippet with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
