  "flows": "Import -> declare_namespace(__name__)",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad exception handling to suppress import errors; no malicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard pattern for namespace declaration in Python packages. It attempts to import pkg_resources and declare the namespace, with a try-except block to handle potential import errors silently. There are no data inputs, outputs, or malicious behaviors. The exception handling is typical for such boilerplate but could hide import issues; however, it does not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscation or suspicious code is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard namespace package declaration with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The security risk is negligible, and malware likelihood is zero. The silent exception handling is common but not malicious. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
