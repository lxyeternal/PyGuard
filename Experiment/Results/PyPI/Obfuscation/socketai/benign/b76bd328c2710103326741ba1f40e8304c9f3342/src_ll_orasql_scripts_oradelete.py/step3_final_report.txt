  "purpose": "Minimal boilerplate header with shebang and encoding declaration, serving as a placeholder or template.",
  "sources": "Shebang line and encoding comment lines",
  "sinks": "None; no data input, output, or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flows; only static comments present",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, logic, or data handling; no suspicious or unusual code structures",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of shebang and encoding declaration comments with no executable logic, inputs, outputs, or data flows. All reports correctly identify it as harmless boilerplate. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. Scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's minimal and benign nature. Confidence levels are high, reflecting certainty about the code's harmlessness. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign boilerplate with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications to scores or assessments are necessary.",
