  "purpose": "No purpose can be determined as the code is only a shebang and encoding declaration without any functional content.",
  "sources": "None present; no input or data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data output or untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows exist due to absence of executable code.",
  "anomalies": "Lack of executable code; only shebang and encoding comment present, which is standard boilerplate.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a shebang line and a UTF-8 encoding declaration. There are no functions, variables, imports, or any executable statements. This fragment does not perform any operations, read inputs, or handle data, and therefore cannot contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is only a minimal header with no functional or malicious content. It poses no security risks and is likely just the start of a script template.",
