  "flows": "No data flows are present, as there is no executable code.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a shebang and encoding declaration with no actual code, which is unusual and suggests it is incomplete or a placeholder.",
  "analysis": "The code is limited to a shebang line and a UTF-8 encoding comment, which are standard and do not pose any security risks. There are no source, sink, or flow elements, nor any suspicious activity or anomalies within this fragment. As it stands, there is no malicious or suspicious behavior present.",
