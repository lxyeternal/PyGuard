{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a shebang line and encoding declaration, typically used at the start of a Python script to specify the interpreter and character encoding.",
  "sources": "The shebang line ('#!/usr/bin/env python') indicates the source of the script execution environment. The encoding declaration ('# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-') specifies the text encoding.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present, as the code does not perform any operations or data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code does not process or transfer any data.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only boilerplate header comments with no executable code, input, or logic. No anomalies or malicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is minimal, consisting solely of the shebang and encoding declaration. There are no functions, data handling, network operations, or other logic. Since it contains no executable or suspicious behavior, there are no security concerns or malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "This code is simply a standard header for a Python script, with no malicious or security risks. It does not perform any actions or contain any indicators of malware or security threats.",
