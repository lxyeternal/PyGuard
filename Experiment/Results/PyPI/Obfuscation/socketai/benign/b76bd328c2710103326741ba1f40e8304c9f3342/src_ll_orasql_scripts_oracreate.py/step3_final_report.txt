{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a minimal script header, indicating the environment and encoding, with no executable logic.",
  "sources": "No data sources; only a shebang and encoding declaration are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code contains only static header comments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is standard boilerplate with no suspicious elements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a shebang line and an encoding declaration, with no functions, variables, data reads/writes, or executable logic. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present, and the code does not pose any security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal script header with no malicious or security concerns. All assessments and scores are accurate and justified. No further action is necessary.",
