  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard package setup with superficial obfuscation. No malicious activity, code injection, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware score should be 0, obfuscation moderate (~0.6-0.8), and security risk very low (~0.2). Overall, the code poses minimal security concern."
