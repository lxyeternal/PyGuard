{
  "purpose": "The code imports an external module 'cpu_heater', defines an obfuscated addition function, and calls a function from 'cpu_heater' with large data and various parameters, then asserts expected output. It appears to be a computational or testing script with obfuscation and external dependency.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from 'range(114514)' to generate a list of tuples; uses the 'cpu_heater.yhRWbdZiAxiEyzndfHxkoheeISboilVj' function with multiple parameters.",
  "sinks": "The external function 'cpu_heater.yhRWbdZiAxiEyzndfHxkoheeISboilVj' could process data internally; no explicit data leaks or network activity visible in the code snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'range(114514)' into the list of tuples, then into the external function along with the addition function and parameters; output is validated via assertion, but internal behavior of the external function is unknown.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of function and variable names; reliance on a non-standard, unknown external module 'cpu_heater'; creation of a large data structure without clear purpose; use of assert for validation.",
  "analysis": "The code is heavily obfuscated, relying on an external module whose behavior is unknown. It performs computational tasks and validation, with no direct malicious actions evident. The obfuscation and external dependency are suspicious but not definitive of malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the observed obfuscation and lack of direct malicious activity. Slightly increasing the malware score to 0.3 could be justified if the external module is suspected malicious; otherwise, current low scores are appropriate. The overall risk remains moderate due to obfuscation and dependency concerns, but no active malicious behavior is confirmed.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit explicit malicious actions but relies on an obfuscated external module, raising suspicion. It appears benign but warrants caution and further investigation of 'cpu_heater'. The current scores are reasonable, with a slight adjustment to malware risk if external module trustworthiness is questioned.",
