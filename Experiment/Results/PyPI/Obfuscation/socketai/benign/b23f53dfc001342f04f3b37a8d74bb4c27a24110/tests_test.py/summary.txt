  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit explicit malicious actions but relies on an obfuscated external module, raising suspicion. It appears benign but warrants caution and further investigation of 'cpu_heater'. The current scores are reasonable, with a slight adjustment to malware risk if external module trustworthiness is questioned."
