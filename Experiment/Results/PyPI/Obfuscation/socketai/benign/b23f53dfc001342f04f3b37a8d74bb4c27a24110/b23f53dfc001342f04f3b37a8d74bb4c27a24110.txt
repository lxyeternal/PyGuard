      "conclusion": "The code snippet appears benign with obfuscated identifiers that warrant further review but do not currently indicate malicious intent. The low malware and risk scores are appropriate. Continued investigation into the full module and project context is advised to rule out hidden malicious behavior."

      "conclusion": "The code is a concurrency utility with obfuscated identifiers, capable of executing arbitrary functions with timeout and interruption management. It does not contain malware or malicious payloads but can be misused to execute malicious code if supplied by an attacker. Obfuscation and flexible execution warrant caution, especially in untrusted contexts."

      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit explicit malicious actions but relies on an obfuscated external module, raising suspicion. It appears benign but warrants caution and further investigation of 'cpu_heater'. The current scores are reasonable, with a slight adjustment to malware risk if external module trustworthiness is questioned."
