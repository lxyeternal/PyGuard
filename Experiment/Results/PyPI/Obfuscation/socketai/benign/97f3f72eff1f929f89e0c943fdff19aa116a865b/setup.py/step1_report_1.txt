  "purpose": "This code sets up a Python package for the Elyra Python Editor extension for JupyterLab, including package metadata, dependencies, and data files.",
  "sources": "os.path.abspath, os.path.dirname, get_data_files, find_packages, setup, and the hardcoded string variables",
  "sinks": "The setup() function, which executes package installation; potential data file inclusion via get_data_files",
  "flows": "Variables and functions are used to gather package info, then passed to setup() for installation; no untrusted data flow detected",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated-like variable names (e.g., 'aHRDHsuuskAbPDrVIGoryFCShZtuazRB') but they contain static descriptive text; no code injection or dynamic code execution observed; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious network activity",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, utilizing common functions like get_data_files and find_packages, and calling setup() with metadata and dependencies. The variables with obscure names contain static strings, which do not suggest obfuscation or malicious intent. No user input, untrusted data, or network calls are present. There are no indications of backdoors, data leaks, or malicious behaviors. The only unusual aspect is the obfuscated-looking variable names, but they store static descriptions and are not used maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscated variable names do not impact security but might be stylistic or accidental.",
