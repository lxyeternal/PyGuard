  "purpose": "Set up a Python package for Elyra's Python Editor extension, configuring metadata, dependencies, and data files.",
  "sources": "os.path.abspath, get_data_files, find_packages, install_requires, environment variables, input files (if any).",
  "sinks": "setup() function execution which initiates package installation, file path manipulations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables and file paths into setup configuration and data files, ultimately leading to package setup execution.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a variable with a string that contains a detailed description, but no hardcoded secrets or credentials are evident. The base64-like string 'oKMdNnDMgZIkupHwVgoFxnbApGBBHIHI=' appears suspicious but is not decoded or used in a malicious context.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and a Jupyter packaging utility, then defines several variables, including one with a lengthy descriptive string and another that appears to be a base64 or obfuscated string. The variables are used in configuring the package metadata, description, dependencies, and data files. The 'setup()' function is called only if the script runs directly, which is standard for setup scripts. No external network calls, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated logic beyond the suspicious string. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are detected. The string that looks obfuscated is not decoded or used for malicious actions within this code.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a standard Python package setup script for Elyra's extension, with no evident malicious intent or malicious code. The only suspicious element is a string that appears encoded or obfuscated, but it is not utilized in a malicious manner within this context. Overall, the code appears benign.",
