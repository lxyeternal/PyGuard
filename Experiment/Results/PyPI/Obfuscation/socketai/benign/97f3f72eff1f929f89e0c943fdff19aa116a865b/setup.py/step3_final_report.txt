{
  "purpose": "This code is a standard Python package setup script for the Elyra extension, involving package metadata, dependencies, and data files.",
  "sources": "Static strings within obfuscated variable names, including description and a base64-like string; no external input or dynamic data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network calls, file writes, or code execution beyond setup.",
  "flows": "Static data assigned to variables, used in setup() call; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names and a base64-like string that are static and not used maliciously; superficial obfuscation without malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with static package metadata. Obfuscated variable names and strings are superficial and do not indicate malicious behavior. No network activity, code injection, or secrets are present. The obfuscation appears stylistic, not malicious. The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, risk=0.1, obfuscated=0.2) are consistent with the benign analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign package setup script with superficial obfuscation. No signs of malware or security vulnerabilities are present. The existing scores are appropriate and should be maintained.",
