  "purpose": "Setup script for Elyra Python extension package, configuring package metadata, dependencies, and data files for distribution.",
  "sources": "os.path.abspath, os.path.dirname, get_data_files, find_packages, setup",
  "sinks": "setup function call, get_data_files usage",
  "flows": "Imports -> variable assignments -> setup() call",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names, presence of base64-like string, no obvious malicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules for packaging Python projects. It defines variables with obfuscated or non-descriptive names and assigns strings, including a base64-like string, which appears to be informational or placeholder. The get_data_files function is used to include data files for the package. The setup() function is called with these parameters to prepare the package. There are no indications of malicious code such as network activity, system modifications, or hidden backdoors. The variable naming and obfuscated string could suggest attempts to conceal intent but are not definitive evidence of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script for a Python package, with some obfuscation in variable names and strings but no malicious behavior detected. It is a legitimate package configuration script.",
