{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class with an obfuscated name.",
  "sources": "Class definition inheriting from Exception; no data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow; purely a class declaration.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual, obfuscated class name; no functional code or logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward class inheriting from Exception with an obfuscated name. It contains no methods, data, or executable logic. No data sources, sinks, or flows are present. The class is unused and only serves as a placeholder. The obfuscated name raises suspicion but does not indicate malicious intent. The code does not perform any operations, network activity, or data handling. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated≈0.75, risk=0) are consistent with the benign and superficial nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscated class name is superficial and does not imply malicious intent. The scores are appropriate and should remain as is, reflecting the lack of malicious activity and minimal security risk.",
