  "flows": "No data flow since only class declaration exists",
  "anomalies": "Class name appears obfuscated or nonsensical; no other code or logic present",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single custom exception class with a seemingly random, obfuscated name. There are no input, output, data processing, or behavior that could indicate malicious intent. The class is a straightforward subclass of Exception with no additional methods or attributes. The code is minimal and does not include any suspicious or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be an intentionally obfuscated class name for a custom exception, but it contains no malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks. It is likely part of a larger, benign codebase.",
