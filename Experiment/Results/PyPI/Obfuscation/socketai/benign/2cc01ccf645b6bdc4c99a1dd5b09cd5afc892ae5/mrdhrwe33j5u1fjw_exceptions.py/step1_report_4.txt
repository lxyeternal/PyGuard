  "purpose": "Custom exception class definition in Python",
  "sources": "Class declaration; no input or data reading observed",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "None, as the code only defines a class without execution or data flow",
  "anomalies": "Class name appears obfuscated or randomly generated, which could be suspicious; however, no malicious code or behavior is evident",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single exception class with an obfuscated name that inherits from Python's Exception class. There are no data inputs, network calls, or code execution mechanisms. The class does not perform any actions or contain any suspicious behavior. The obfuscated class name might be intended for concealment but is not inherently malicious. Overall, the code appears benign and is consistent with standard Python practices for custom exceptions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, obfuscated-named custom exception class with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is likely part of a larger codebase where such naming might be used for obfuscation or stylistic purposes.",
