  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class named sYnpWaYxQMQphRFDcOPWBHbMkXAnMlKm.",
  "sources": "No data sources; the code only declares a class.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or handle data.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only defines a class with no operational logic.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual class name with seemingly random characters, but no malicious activity or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a custom exception class with a nonsensical name. It contains no methods, data, or executable logic. There are no data sources, sinks, or flows. The class definition itself is straightforward and not suspicious. The random naming could be obfuscation or a placeholder, but it does not indicate malicious intent. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code simply defines a custom exception class with an unusual name. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this snippet.",
