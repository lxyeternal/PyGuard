  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class named sYnpWaYxQMQphRFDcOPWBHbMkXAnMlKm.",
  "sources": "None (no data input or external sources).",
  "sinks": "None (no data output, network communication, or file operations).",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths, as the code only defines a class.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual naming convention with a nonsensical class name, which could suggest obfuscation or malicious intent, but it is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a custom exception class inheriting from Exception. The class name appears intentionally obfuscated or nonsensical. There are no data inputs, outputs, network operations, or other behaviors indicating malicious activity. The code is minimal and does not contain any hidden or suspicious patterns. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward class definition with an unusual class name. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet. The unconventional naming might warrant further context, but on its own, it poses no threat.",
