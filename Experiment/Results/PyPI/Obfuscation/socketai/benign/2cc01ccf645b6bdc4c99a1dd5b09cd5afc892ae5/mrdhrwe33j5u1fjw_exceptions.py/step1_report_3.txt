{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class named sYnpWaYxQMQphRFDcOPWBHbMkXAnMlKm.",
  "sources": "The class definition itself, no input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the code only declares a class.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual class name with obfuscated appearance; no functional code or logic; no suspicious operations.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a single class definition that inherits from Exception, with a deliberately obfuscated class name. There are no data inputs, outputs, or operations. The class is unused, and there are no behaviors indicating malicious intent or malicious code execution. The obfuscated class name alone is not evidence of malicious behavior but may suggest an attempt at concealment. Overall, the code is benign and does not perform any actions or contain harmful constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, harmless class definition with obfuscated naming, likely for exception handling. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
