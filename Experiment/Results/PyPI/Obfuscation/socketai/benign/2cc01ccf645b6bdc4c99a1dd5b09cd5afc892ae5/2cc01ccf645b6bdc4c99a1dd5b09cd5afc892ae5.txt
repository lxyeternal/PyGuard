The high obfuscation score reflects suspicion, but the overall risk remains low due to lack of further behavior. Continued review of the full codebase is recommended if more context becomes available."

The malware score is 0, the obfuscated score is high (~0.75), and the security risk is low (~0.2). Overall, the code appears benign but warrants cautious monitoring due to obfuscation."
