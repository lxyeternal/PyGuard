  "conclusion": "The snippet is a minimal import statement with an obfuscated symbol. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The high obfuscation score reflects suspicion, but the overall risk remains low due to lack of further behavior. Continued review of the full codebase is recommended if more context becomes available."
