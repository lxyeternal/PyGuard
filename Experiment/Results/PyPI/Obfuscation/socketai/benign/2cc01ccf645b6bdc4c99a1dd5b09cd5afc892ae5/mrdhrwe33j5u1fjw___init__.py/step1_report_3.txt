  "purpose": "Import a specific class or object named 'PzDXZLxIlKcPWIwHDjmRapWfLrhRUIaX' from a local module called 'resolver'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module '.resolver'.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data sinks or external data handling shown.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis possible beyond import statement; no input or output processing present.",
  "anomalies": "The imported name 'PzDXZLxIlKcPWIwHDjmRapWfLrhRUIaX' appears obfuscated or randomly generated, which can be suspicious. The code snippet is minimal and does not provide context for malicious intent, but the obfuscated naming is noteworthy.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement importing an object with an obfuscated or nonsensical name from a local module. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity, data handling, or code execution. The obfuscated name might be part of an effort to conceal malicious functionality or simply a placeholder. No additional context or code is provided, limiting the assessment to suspicion based on naming.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet alone does not demonstrate malicious behavior, but the obfuscated naming raises suspicion. Without further context, it cannot be definitively malicious. It appears to be a benign import statement, though the naming pattern warrants caution if part of a larger suspicious codebase.",
