{
  "purpose": "The code imports an obfuscated symbol from a local module, likely for internal use or concealment.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads data from the local module '.resolver' and the symbol 'PzDXZLxIlKcPWIwHDjmRapWfLrhRUIaX'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows beyond the import; the symbol is imported but not used or manipulated.",
  "anomalies": "The imported symbol name is highly obfuscated and nonsensical, which is suspicious but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement with an obfuscated symbol, indicating potential concealment. No further code or behavior is provided, limiting analysis. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. Malware scores are appropriately zero; obfuscation scores are high, reflecting suspicion; security risk scores are low, consistent with minimal code. Without additional context, the import alone is benign but warrants monitoring for obfuscation patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet is a minimal import statement with an obfuscated symbol. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The high obfuscation score reflects suspicion, but the overall risk remains low due to lack of further behavior. Continued review of the full codebase is recommended if more context becomes available.",
