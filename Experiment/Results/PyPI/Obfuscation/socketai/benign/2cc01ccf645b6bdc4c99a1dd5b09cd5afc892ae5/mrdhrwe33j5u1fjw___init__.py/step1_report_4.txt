{
  "purpose": "Import a specific class or function named 'PzDXZLxIlKcPWIwHDjmRapWfLrhRUIaX' from a local module 'resolver'.",
  "sources": "Import statement reading from the local module 'resolver'.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; no external network or sensitive data operations present.",
  "flows": "N/A - only an import statement, no data flow from source to sink.",
  "anomalies": "The imported name 'PzDXZLxIlKcPWIwHDjmRapWfLrhRUIaX' appears to be a randomly generated or obfuscated identifier, which could be suspicious. The module name 'resolver' is generic but does not inherently indicate malicious intent. No other code present to analyze.",
  "analysis": "The code only consists of an import statement from a relative module. The imported name is highly obfuscated or randomly generated, which may be a sign of obfuscation or concealment. No other logic, data handling, or external interactions are present in the snippet. The source and sink are limited to import statements with a seemingly obscure identifier. Without additional context, no malicious behavior can be confirmed, but obfuscation raises suspicion about concealment.",
  "conclusion": "This minimal code snippet performs a simple import with an obfuscated identifier, which alone does not demonstrate malicious behavior but suggests possible obfuscation or concealment. No evidence of malware or security risks is apparent from this fragment alone.",
