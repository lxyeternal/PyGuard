  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, the appropriateness of the scores, and any logical inconsistencies.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe a single import statement importing an obfuscated or nonsensical symbol `PzDXZLxIlKcPWIwHDjmRapWfLrhRUIaX` from a local module `resolver`.\n- No additional code, data flows, or external interactions are provided.\n- The symbol name appears obfuscated, which can be suspicious, but obfuscation alone does not confirm malicious intent.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of evidence of malicious activity.\n- The confidence levels are moderate, reflecting suspicion based on naming but acknowledging the lack of concrete malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code presence:** The code snippet is only an import statement. No other code, data flows, or sinks are present. So, no malicious activity can be confirmed from this alone.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No technical errors are evident; the import syntax is correct. The primary concern is the obfuscated naming, which is noted appropriately.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware score: 0 is appropriate given the minimal code and lack of malicious activity.\n  - Obfuscated score: 0.7 to 0.8 seems reasonable, as the names are highly obfuscated.\n  - Security risk: 0.2 to 0.3 is reasonable, indicating a low but noteworthy suspicion.\n  - Confidence: 0.3 to 0.4 aligns with the cautious suspicion based on naming.\n\n### Specific issues:\n- The reports are consistent with each other and appropriately cautious.\n- No report overstates risk or suggests malicious activity without evidence.\n- The reasoning is sound: obfuscation is suspicious but not proof of malware.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Adjustments to scores:** Given the evidence, I agree with the current scores. The only point is that the obfuscated score could be slightly lowered if additional context were available, but as it stands, it reflects suspicion well.\n- **Risk justification:** Since no malicious activity is demonstrated, the malware score remains at 0. No change needed.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** The reports correctly do not assume vulnerabilities based solely on obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (appropriate)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.7 (appropriate)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (appropriate)\n\n**Overall, the reports are cautious but accurate. Without further code or context, the import statement alone does not indicate malicious activity.**\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.7\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and reasoning.",
