{
  "purpose": "Import a specific class or function named 'PzDXZLxIlKcPWIwHDjmRapWfLrhRUIaX' from a local module called 'resolver'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module 'resolver' and accesses 'PzDXZLxIlKcPWIwHDjmRapWfLrhRUIaX' within it.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data output functions present; no untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Import statement reads module -> access specific attribute; no data flow or untrusted data path present.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual naming pattern for the imported attribute, which appears as a random string; no additional context or code is provided to clarify its purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple relative import statement that imports a single attribute with a seemingly obfuscated name from a local module. Without further context or code, it's impossible to determine if this is malicious. The naming could be benign or part of obfuscated code, but the snippet alone does not indicate malicious intent. No suspicious patterns such as network calls, file access, or environment variable use are present. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there is no evidence of malicious behavior. The unusual naming is noteworthy but not inherently malicious. Further code context is needed to assess security risk fully.",
