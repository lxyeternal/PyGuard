  "purpose": "Import a class or function named 'PzDXZLxIlKcPWIwHDjmRapWfLrhRUIaX' from a local module 'resolver'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a relative module 'resolver'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; the code only imports a symbol.",
  "flows": "Import statement loads a class/function from the local module into the namespace.",
  "anomalies": "The imported symbol name 'PzDXZLxIlKcPWIwHDjmRapWfLrhRUIaX' appears obfuscated or nonsensical, which may suggest malicious obfuscation or intentional concealment. No other suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a single import statement from a relative module. The symbol name is highly obfuscated, which could indicate an attempt to hide malicious intent or payload. Without additional context or code, no further analysis of behavior can be performed. No visible malicious behavior or anomalies are evident beyond obfuscation. The code itself is minimal and appears standard, but the obfuscated symbol warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "This code imports an obfuscated symbol from a local module. The obfuscation raises suspicion, but with only this snippet, there is no definitive malicious activity. Further code review is needed to determine intent.",
