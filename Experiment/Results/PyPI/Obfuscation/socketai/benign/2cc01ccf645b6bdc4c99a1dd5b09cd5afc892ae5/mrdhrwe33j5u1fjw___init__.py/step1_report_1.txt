{
  "purpose": "Import a class or function named PzDXZLxIlKcPWIwHDjmRapWfLrhRUIaX from a local resolver module",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module '.resolver'",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no data output, network, or system modification operations shown",
  "flows": "No data flow paths present in the single import statement",
  "anomalies": "Use of an obfuscated or nonsensical identifier for import; no context provided about resolver or the imported name",
  "analysis": "The code only contains an import statement importing a symbol with an obfuscated name from a local module. There are no operations, data handling, or behaviors that could indicate malicious activity. The suspicious aspect is the non-descriptive, seemingly random class or function name, which may suggest obfuscation or concealment, but this alone does not imply malicious intent. Without additional code, the likelihood of malicious behavior cannot be established.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears minimal and possibly obfuscated, but no malicious actions are demonstrated.",
  "confidence": 0.3,
  "obfuscated": 0.7,
