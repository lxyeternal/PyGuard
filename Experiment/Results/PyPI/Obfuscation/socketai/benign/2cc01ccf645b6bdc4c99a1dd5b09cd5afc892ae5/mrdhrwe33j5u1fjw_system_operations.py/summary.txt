  "conclusion": "The code is a complex, obfuscated directory search utility with no evidence of malicious activity. The obfuscation is notable but not malicious. The malware score is 0, the obfuscated score is high (~0.75), and the security risk is low (~0.2). Overall, the code appears benign but warrants cautious monitoring due to obfuscation."
