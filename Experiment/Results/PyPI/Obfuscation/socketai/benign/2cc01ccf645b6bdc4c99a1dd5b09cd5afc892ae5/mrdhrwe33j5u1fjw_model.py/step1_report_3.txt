  "purpose": "Define platform-specific directory paths and filename transformations encapsulated in a dataclass and enum.",
  "sources": "Reading platform identifiers, directory paths, and filename transformation functions from class instances.",
  "sinks": "Transformations applied to file paths, potential for mishandling paths if used improperly.",
  "flows": "Input strings for file paths are transformed by lambda functions, but these are safe string replacements, not security-sensitive flows.",
  "anomalies": "Code contains no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The lambda functions are simple string replacements. No obfuscated code or malicious network activity. The class structures and enums are used to organize platform info, with no suspicious logic or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code defines dataclasses representing different platform configurations, including directory paths and filename transformation functions, which are simple string replacements. These functions do not execute untrusted code, do not involve system calls, nor contain hidden malicious logic. The enums encapsulate these configurations, and no external data sources or network operations are present. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward configuration setup for handling platform-specific path formatting. There are no indications of malicious intent, no suspicious data flows, and no anomalous behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration structure for platform-specific path handling with no malicious behavior detected. The lambda functions perform simple string replacements without executing untrusted code. No security risks or malware indicators are present.",
