  "purpose": "Define platform-specific directory paths and path normalization functions using data classes and lambdas, encapsulated in an enum for easy access.",
  "sources": "Data class initializations, static path strings, lambda functions performing string replacements for path normalization.",
  "sinks": "The lambdas operate on string paths, transforming them for platform compatibility; no external data or untrusted input involved.",
  "flows": "Static path strings passed through lambdas for normalization, with no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "Use of simple string replacement lambdas for path normalization is standard; no secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides platform-specific configurations for Windows, Mac, and Linux, using data classes and lambdas for path normalization. The lambdas perform straightforward string replacements, serving common cross-platform needs. No external input, network activity, or malicious logic is present. The code is purely configuration-oriented, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk~0.1) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, configuration-focused implementation for platform-specific path handling. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scoring across reports is accurate and consistent with the code's intent.",
