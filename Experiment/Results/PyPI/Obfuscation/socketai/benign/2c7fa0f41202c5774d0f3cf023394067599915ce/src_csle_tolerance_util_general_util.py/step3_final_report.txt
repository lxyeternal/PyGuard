  "purpose": "Utility functions for mathematical operations and environment registration, likely used in reinforcement learning or simulation contexts.",
  "sources": "Parameters passed to functions, environment registration strings, internal math operations, and list data used in np.random.choice.",
  "sinks": "No external data leaks or malicious sinks; data flows are internal within the functions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into mathematical functions and registration calls; outputs are internal or used for probabilistic choices.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names, placeholder or nonsensical registration strings, silent exception handling in math functions, and dynamic registration of environments with obscure IDs.",
  "analysis": "The code contains utility functions for probability, sigmoid, and logit calculations, along with environment registration routines. The obfuscated naming and placeholder registration strings suggest an attempt to conceal details but do not directly indicate malicious intent. No network activity, file operations, or data exfiltration are evident. The use of silent exception handling could hide errors but is not inherently malicious. The probabilistic choice function relies on input data, which could be manipulated, but this is typical in such utilities. Overall, the code appears benign, serving as utility or setup code with obfuscation that warrants cautious review but does not constitute malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily utility functions with obfuscated identifiers and environment registration, showing no signs of malicious activity. The obfuscation and placeholder IDs are suspicious but not definitive of malware. The overall security risk is low, and the malware likelihood is minimal.",
