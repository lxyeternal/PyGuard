  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple script performing basic operations, possibly for data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "Reading data from input sources such as files, environment variables, or network connections.",
  "sinks": "Writing data to files, printing to stdout, or sending data over the network.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks through various processing functions, including string manipulations and possibly network or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious function calls detected. No unusual dynamic code execution or hidden backdoors identified. The code structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script's structure indicates typical data handling routines without signs of malicious intent. No suspicious external connections, no obfuscated or misleading variable names. The functions and data flow are consistent with legitimate operations. Absence of hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or anomalous patterns. Due to the limited context and straightforward nature, no malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, functioning as intended without any malicious payloads or security issues.",
