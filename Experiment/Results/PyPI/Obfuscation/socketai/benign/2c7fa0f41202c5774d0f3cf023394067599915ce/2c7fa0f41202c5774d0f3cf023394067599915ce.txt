The obfuscation may be intentional for concealment but does not imply malicious intent. The overall security risk is minimal, primarily related to loading potentially malicious JSON data, which is a common pattern in configuration handling."

There is no evidence of malware, malicious behavior, or active security threats. The obfuscation and logging anomaly are probably accidental or due to code obfuscation but do not constitute malicious activity."

The scores are consistent with this assessment, indicating moderate security concern primarily due to obfuscation and dynamic code patterns. No definitive malicious activity is confirmed, but caution is advised."
