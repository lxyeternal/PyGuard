{
  "purpose": "Importing a variable named __version__ from the current package/module, likely for versioning or metadata purposes.",
  "sources": "The source is the relative import from the current package/module: from . __version__",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows are apparent, as this is a simple import statement.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only performs a static import.",
  "anomalies": "The imported name 'AiTETuUGBdfhGeVRGbMQhGwLVqMkSNyX' appears as a random string, which is unusual for typical version variable naming. It might be a hardcoded secret or a misleading variable name, but without further context, this could be suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a variable with a seemingly random name from the current package/module. The filename or context isn't provided, but such a nonsensical variable name could be an obfuscated or secret token, or simply a poorly named variable. The import itself is benign, but the variable name raises suspicion about hidden or malicious intent if used improperly. There are no other code elements, so no further behavior can be inferred.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a straightforward import of a variable with a non-standard name. Without additional context, this alone is not malicious, but the unusual variable name warrants further review to ensure it does not serve as a hidden secret or malicious trigger.",
