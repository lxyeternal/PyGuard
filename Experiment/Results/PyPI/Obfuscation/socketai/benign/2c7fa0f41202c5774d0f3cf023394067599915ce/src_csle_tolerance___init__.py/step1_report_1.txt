  "purpose": "Import a variable or object named AiTETuUGBdfhGeVRGbMQhGwLVqMkSNyX from a local module or package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a relative module (__version__)",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output observed",
  "flows": "Import statement loads code or data from a local module into the current namespace",
  "anomalies": "The imported name 'AiTETuUGBdfhGeVRGbMQhGwLVqMkSNyX' appears as a random string, which may suggest obfuscation or a placeholder; no other suspicious behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code is a single import statement importing a symbol with a seemingly random name from a local module (__version__). There are no other operations, no code execution, network calls, or data handling. The naming pattern might be indicative of obfuscation or a placeholder, but based solely on this line, it does not exhibit malicious behavior. The import is a standard Python pattern for accessing version info or similar data.\n\nNo signs of malware, malicious data flow, or anomalies beyond possible obfuscation of symbol names.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard import operation with an unusually named symbol, which could be a sign of obfuscation but not necessarily malicious. There is no evident malicious intent or suspicious activity in this snippet.",
