  "purpose": "Import a symbol with an obfuscated or random name from a local module (__version__).",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no data input or external sources involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows; the code is a static import with no execution or data leakage.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink flows; the import is static and does not process untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "The variable name 'AiTETuUGBdfhGeVRGbMQhGwLVqMkSNyX' is highly obfuscated or random, which could be suspicious but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple relative import of a symbol with an unusual name from a local module. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with the obfuscated name being the only notable feature. No signs of malicious activity, code injection, network activity, or data leaks are present. The obfuscation may serve to conceal version info or implementation details but does not imply malicious intent. Malware scores are appropriately low (0 or 0.1), and security risk scores are minimal. The confidence in benign assessment is high, and the obfuscation score reflects the unusual naming.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement with an obfuscated variable name. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security threats based solely on this snippet. The current scores are appropriate; the malware score remains at 0, obfuscation is moderate, and security risk is minimal.",
