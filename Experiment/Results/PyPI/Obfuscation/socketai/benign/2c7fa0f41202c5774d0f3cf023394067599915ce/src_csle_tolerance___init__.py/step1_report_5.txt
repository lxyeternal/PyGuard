{
  "purpose": "Import a version identifier from a relative module, likely used for package versioning.",
  "sources": "The source is a local module (relative import) that provides the __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data is used or propagated.",
  "flows": "The imported __version__ is assigned locally but not used within this snippet; no data flows are observable.",
  "anomalies": "The import statement is unusual due to the obfuscated-looking variable name 'AiTETuUGBdfhGeVRGbMQhGwLVqMkSNyX'. The variable name appears intentionally complex, which could be an obfuscation tactic, but this alone does not imply malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard relative import of a version variable from the current package module. The variable name used for import is highly obfuscated, which could indicate an attempt to conceal its purpose or value. No other code or logic is present to assess malicious behavior. The snippet alone does not perform any suspicious actions such as network access, data leakage, or system modification.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with an unusually obfuscated variable name. It does not exhibit signs of malicious behavior or security risks on its own. The obfuscation may be for code concealment but does not constitute malicious intent by itself.",
