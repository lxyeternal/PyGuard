  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or external effects evident.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; only a static import statement.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual naming of the imported variable (AiTETuUGBdfhGeVRGbMQhGwLVqMkSNyX) suggests possible obfuscation or a generated name, which could be suspicious in some contexts.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward relative import of a variable named 'AiTETuUGBdfhGeVRGbMQhGwLVqMkSNyX' from the __version__ module. The variable name appears intentionally obscure or randomly generated, which might be an attempt to hide its purpose or prevent easy identification. The import itself is standard Python syntax and does not indicate malicious behavior by default. However, the unusual variable name could be a sign of obfuscation or an attempt to conceal malicious intent, but on its own, it is not conclusive.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with an obfuscated variable name. No direct malicious actions are evident. The unusual naming warrants cautious review of the __version__ module, but based solely on this snippet, there is no clear malicious behavior.",
