  "purpose": "Import a version string or identifier from a local module",
  "sources": "The code reads data from a relative import of __version__",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or outputs observed in this snippet",
  "flows": "The imported __version__ value could be used elsewhere, but not shown here",
  "anomalies": "Unusual: the imported name 'AiTETuUGBdfhGeVRGbMQhGwLVqMkSNyX' appears to be a random string, which may indicate obfuscation or a generated variable name",
  "analysis": "The code performs a relative import from a local module, importing a variable with a complex, seemingly random name. This could be benign if __version__ is a legitimate version string, but the imported variable name's complexity suggests obfuscation or generated code. There is no direct malicious activity or malicious code execution visible. The code itself is minimal and does not perform any actions besides import.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet is a simple import statement with an unusually complex variable name, likely for versioning or obfuscation purposes. No malicious behavior or malware is evident. The code appears to be part of a larger, possibly obfuscated, codebase but on its own, it poses no security risk.",
