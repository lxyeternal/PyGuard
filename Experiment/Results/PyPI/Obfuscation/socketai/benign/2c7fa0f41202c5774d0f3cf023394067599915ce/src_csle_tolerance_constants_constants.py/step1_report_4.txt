{
  "purpose": "The class appears to define a set of class variables with string values, potentially for configuration or obfuscation purposes.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources such as user input, network, or environment variables are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data could cause data leaks, code execution, or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink is observable, as the code only defines static class variables.",
  "anomalies": "The variable names are obfuscated or nonsensical, which could indicate an attempt to hide purpose. The string values assigned seem arbitrary and do not perform any direct malicious action.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with multiple class variables assigned to string literals. No functions, methods, or executable code are present. The naming conventions suggest obfuscation, but there is no evidence of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network activity, or malicious logic. Without further context or usage, it appears benign, potentially designed to obfuscate or configure values.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks based solely on class variable definitions. It appears to be static configuration or obfuscation without harmful intent.",

  "obfuscated": 0.8,
