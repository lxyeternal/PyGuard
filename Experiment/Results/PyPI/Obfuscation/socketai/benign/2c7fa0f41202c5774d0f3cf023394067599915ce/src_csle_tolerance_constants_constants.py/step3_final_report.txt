{
  "purpose": "A class containing obfuscated static string variables, likely serving as constants or configuration parameters.",
  "sources": "Class variable assignments with string literals, no input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static assignments without dynamic or external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, but no active code, data flow, or malicious indicators.",
  "analysis": "The code is a class with static string variables assigned fixed values, with obfuscated names. There are no functions, data flows, external interactions, or dynamic behaviors. The obfuscation appears to be an attempt to conceal purpose but does not inherently indicate malicious intent. The absence of code injection, network activity, or data leaks suggests benign behavior. The high obfuscation score reflects the variable naming, but the malware and security risk scores are appropriately low given the static, non-interactive nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign obfuscated constants class with no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. The obfuscation is notable but not indicative of malicious intent in isolation. The scores assigned are consistent with the analysis, and no further action is necessary.",
