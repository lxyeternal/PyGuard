  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious behavior, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setup' from 'setuptools' and executes 'setup()' when run as the main program. This is a standard pattern for defining a setup script for packaging Python projects. The code does not include any malicious actions, data handling, or suspicious code. It is a minimal, typical setup script with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious behavior or security issues detected.",
