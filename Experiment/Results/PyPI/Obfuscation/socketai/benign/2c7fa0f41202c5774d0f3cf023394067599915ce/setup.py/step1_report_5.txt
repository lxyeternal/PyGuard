  "purpose": "To facilitate the installation and distribution of a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it solely calls the setup function from setuptools.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources; the code simply invokes setup() when run as main.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and uses standard practices with no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the setup function from setuptools and calls it if the script is run directly. This is a common pattern in Python packaging to define package metadata and installation procedures. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data leakage, or backdoors. The code is very simple and adheres to standard packaging practices, with no anomalies or suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for standard package setup, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
