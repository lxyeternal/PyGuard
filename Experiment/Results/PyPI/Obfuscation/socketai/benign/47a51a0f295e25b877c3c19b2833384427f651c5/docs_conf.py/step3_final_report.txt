  "purpose": "Configuration and metadata setup for the 'drf_pretty_exception_handler' documentation and exception handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements, variable assignments, and static configuration data within the script.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, network calls, or data sinks are present; the code is purely static configuration.",
  "flows": "The code does not process untrusted input; it only defines variables and imports modules without dynamic data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated variable names, which may suggest auto-generation or obfuscation but do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static configuration script for documentation purposes, with no evidence of malicious behavior, network activity, or data exfiltration. Variable obfuscation is superficial and likely intentional or auto-generated. No dynamic code execution or data handling from untrusted sources is present. The malware score is appropriately zero, and the security risk is minimal. Obfuscation is high but not malicious, and the overall code is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign configuration code with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. The obfuscation appears superficial, and the code serves as documentation setup. Scores are consistent with this assessment.",
