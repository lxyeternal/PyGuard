{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up configuration and metadata for documentation related to 'drf_pretty_exception_handler', likely part of a documentation or build process.",
  "sources": "os.environ, sys.path, imported module 'drf_pretty_exception_handler', and hardcoded string variables.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly found; no apparent data sinks handling untrusted input or performing sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code mainly assigns static data to variables and sets configurations.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names (e.g., 'MhObBQZampYCzofKeUsmVPzubvmIklZY') suggest obfuscation or auto-generated code. No dynamic code execution, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and a specific handler module, then initializes a series of variables with configuration data, such as documentation paths, project info, and metadata. Variable names are inconsistent and appear obfuscated, which could be accidental or intentional. There are no signs of malicious behavior, network activity, or code injection. The code seems to serve as a configuration or documentation setup, with no suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, primarily involved in configuration and metadata setup for documentation purposes. There are no signs of malicious activity, malware, or security risks present.",
