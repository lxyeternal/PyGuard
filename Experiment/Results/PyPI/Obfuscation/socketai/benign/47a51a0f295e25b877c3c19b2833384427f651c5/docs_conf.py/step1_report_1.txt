{
  "purpose": "The script appears to set up configuration and metadata for generating documentation for the 'drf_pretty_exception_handler' package, likely using Sphinx.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, importing modules, and accessing attributes of the imported module",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code primarily defines variables and configuration data",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated or nonsensical variable names, but no suspicious or malicious code behavior detected. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports a module, sets up configuration variables for documentation, and defines metadata such as authorship and project info. Variable names are obfuscated but do not indicate malicious intent. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code appears to be boilerplate or configuration for documentation generation, with no suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "This script serves as a configuration or setup script for documentation purposes. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident. The obfuscated variable names seem to be an artifact rather than an indicator of malicious intent.",
