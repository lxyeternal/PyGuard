  "purpose": "Custom exception handler for Django REST Framework to standardize error responses",
  "sources": "Settings attributes, exception instances, request data (implied through exception handling)",
  "sinks": "Response objects returning error details, setting rollback state in case of API exceptions",
  "flows": "Exception instances are transformed into standardized responses; exceptions propagate from source to sink via this handler",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable and function names; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic; no data leakage or malicious actions observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception handler for Django REST Framework. It maps specific exceptions (Http404, PermissionDenied) to DRF exceptions, then processes API exceptions by constructing structured error responses. It includes logic to handle authorization headers, retry timing, and error details, and calls set_rollback to maintain transaction integrity on errors. The code relies on settings for configuration but does not perform any network activity, data theft, or system modifications. The variable and function naming appears intentionally obfuscated but this does not indicate malicious intent. No suspicious code patterns, data leaks, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a customized error handling routine for a Django API. It is not malicious and appears to be a standard, if obfuscated, implementation aimed at uniform error responses. No malicious activity or security risks are evident.",
