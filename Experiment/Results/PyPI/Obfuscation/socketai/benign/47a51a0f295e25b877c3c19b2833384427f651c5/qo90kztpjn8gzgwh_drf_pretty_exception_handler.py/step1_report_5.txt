  "purpose": "Custom exception handling for Django REST framework, standardizing responses for various exceptions.",
  "sources": "Settings attribute 'PRETTY_EXCEPTION_HANDLER', exception details from 'xaXyHyMPzVuqkjEMdZrgrWwZiOzrskOh'.",
  "sinks": "Response objects potentially returning detailed exception info, including error details and headers.",
  "flows": "Exception type checks and conversions lead to constructing and returning Response objects with error info.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names; dynamic retrieval of settings; no hardcoded credentials or network calls; no obfuscation or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception handler that converts various Django and DRF exceptions into standardized JSON responses. It retrieves settings dynamically, checks exception types, and formats error responses accordingly. The variable naming is obfuscated but does not indicate malicious intent. No network operations, file manipulations, or data exfiltration are present. The logic appears to focus solely on exception formatting and response standardization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, albeit obfuscated, exception handling utility for Django REST framework. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The obfuscation is likely a code style choice rather than malicious intent.",
