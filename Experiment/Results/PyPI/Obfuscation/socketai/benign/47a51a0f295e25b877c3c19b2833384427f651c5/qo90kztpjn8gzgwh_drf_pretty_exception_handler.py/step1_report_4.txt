  "purpose": "This code provides a custom exception handler for Django REST Framework, standardizing API error responses.",
  "sources": "Imports from Django and DRF modules, settings attributes, and exception instances.",
  "sinks": "The Response object returned by the handler, which sends error details to clients.",
  "flows": "Exceptions are caught and converted into standardized API responses within the handler function.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names (e.g., lcOwKBYMqrTBDckVqmWtdfBWaZZGWiIh) and dynamic attribute access (getattr). No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules from Django and DRF, with some variables deliberately obfuscated via random string names. It defines a configuration dictionary that merges default settings with custom ones, potentially for exception display preferences. The core function, which appears to be a custom exception handler, converts standard exceptions like Http404 and PermissionDenied into DRF API exceptions. When handling API exceptions, it constructs a response payload with status and error details, respecting attributes like 'auth_header' and 'wait' if present. The response is returned via DRF's Response object. No code injection, data leakage, or network activity is evident. The obfuscation seems intentional but does not imply malicious intent; it might hinder readability but does not alter behavior maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a standard exception handling pattern with obfuscated variable names. It does not contain malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. The obfuscation appears to be a coding style choice rather than an indicator of malicious intent. The overall security risk is low.",
