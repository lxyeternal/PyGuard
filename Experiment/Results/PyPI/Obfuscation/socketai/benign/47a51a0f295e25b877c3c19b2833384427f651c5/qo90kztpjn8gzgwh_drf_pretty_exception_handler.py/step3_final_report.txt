  "purpose": "Custom exception handler for Django REST Framework that normalizes exceptions and constructs structured JSON responses, optionally including headers like 'WWW-Authenticate' and 'Retry-After'.",
  "sources": "Exception instances such as Http404, PermissionDenied, and exceptions.APIException; settings for configuration.",
  "sinks": "Response object returned to the client, headers added to the response.",
  "flows": "Exception instances are checked and potentially replaced; exception details are processed into a response dictionary; headers are added based on exception attributes; response is returned.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names; dynamic settings access; no hardcoded secrets or network activity; no suspicious logic beyond obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard DRF exception handler that normalizes common exceptions into structured API responses, adding optional headers. Obfuscation is present but appears stylistic, not malicious. No network activity, data leaks, or backdoors are detected. The exception handling logic correctly maps exceptions to responses, and the use of settings for configuration is typical. The obfuscation does not affect the security posture but may impact maintainability. Scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0.7-0.8, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated exception handler with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. The obfuscation is notable but not malicious. The security risk is low, and no modifications are necessary.",
