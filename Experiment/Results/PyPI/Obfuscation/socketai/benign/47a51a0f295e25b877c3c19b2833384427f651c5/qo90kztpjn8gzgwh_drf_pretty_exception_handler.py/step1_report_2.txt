  "purpose": "Custom exception handling for Django REST Framework to standardize error responses and manage exception translation.",
  "sources": "Reading settings for exception configuration, handling exceptions passed to the function.",
  "sinks": "Returning Response objects with error details, potentially exposing internal exception information.",
  "flows": "Exceptions like Http404 and PermissionDenied are caught and translated into DRF responses; other exceptions are handled or passed through.",
  "anomalies": "Use of non-descriptive variable names, dynamic merging of settings, and handling of exceptions without sanitization; no suspicious code injection or hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard Django and DRF modules, and defines a function that converts certain exceptions into standardized API responses. It reads configuration from settings, applies exception translation, and returns appropriate responses. Variable names are obfuscated, but the logic follows typical exception handling patterns. No hardcoded secrets or malicious behaviors are evident. The code does not perform any network communication, system modifications, or data exfiltration. It mainly re-structures error responses, which appears benign. The only concern is the obfuscated style and dynamic settings access, but these do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, albeit obfuscated, custom exception handler for a Django REST Framework project. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided content.",
