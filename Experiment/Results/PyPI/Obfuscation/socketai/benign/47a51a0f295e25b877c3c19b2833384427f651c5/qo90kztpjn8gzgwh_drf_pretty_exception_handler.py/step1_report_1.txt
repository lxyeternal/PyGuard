  "purpose": "Custom exception handler for Django REST Framework to standardize API error responses.",
  "sources": "Imports from Django and DRF modules; usage of settings for configuration; exception handling within the function.",
  "sinks": "Response object creation and setting rollback state; potential exposure of exception details via response.",
  "flows": "Input exceptions → normalize to DRF exceptions → build structured response based on exception type → return Response or None.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names; usage of dynamic configuration from settings; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious network operations; no malicious code or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard Django and DRF modules and defines a function 'lcOwKBYMqrTBDckVqmWtdfBWaZZGWiIh' that processes exceptions for API responses. It normalizes specific exceptions (Http404, PermissionDenied) to DRF exceptions, then constructs structured error responses including status codes and error details. The response includes optional headers like 'WWW-Authenticate' and 'Retry-After' if provided by the exception. It also handles generic server errors by returning a 500 response with exception info. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious network activity. The code uses dynamic configuration from settings, which is typical and not suspicious. The obfuscated variable and function names are a concern but do not indicate malicious intent, possibly obfuscation for code compression or intellectual property reasons.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, albeit obfuscated, custom exception handler for Django REST Framework. There is no evidence of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The obfuscation is unusual but not inherently malicious. Overall, it functions as intended for error handling without evident security threats.",
