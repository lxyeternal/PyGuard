{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be setting up a test environment using pytest and importing a specific exception handler for API responses.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded string values assigned to variables within functions; no external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks such as network communication, file writing, or data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is present; variables are assigned static strings and are not used elsewhere in the code.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains obfuscated-looking variable names and functions with non-descriptive names, but this alone is not malicious. There are no suspicious behaviors, such as data exfiltration or system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a pytest module and a specific exception handler, defines a fixture with a static string, and another function that also uses a static string parameter. There are no external data inputs, no network or file operations, no eval or exec statements, and no sensitive information handling. The variable names are non-descriptive but do not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code seems to serve a testing purpose without any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign test setup using pytest, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
