{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a test setup for the 'drf_pretty_exception_handler' module using pytest framework, with fixture and test functions defined.",
  "sources": "Imports pytest, uses a fixture function, and a test function. No external or untrusted data sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow to untrusted destinations are present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths are present; the code only defines functions and variables.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of nonsensical variable and function names, but no suspicious activity such as hardcoded secrets, network calls, or code injection.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a testing library, defines a fixture with an unused variable, and another function that also defines a variable. No external input handling, data leaks, or malicious operations are evident. Variable names appear obfuscated or random but do not indicate malicious intent. No evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple test setup with obfuscated variable names and no malicious or suspicious activity. It does not contain malware, security risks, or anomalies beyond non-descriptive naming.",
