  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for defining dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' and 'HISTORY.rst' files; defining dependency lists; calling setup() with package info.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static file reads and setup call only.",
  "flows": "File reads for descriptions -> dependency list definitions -> setup() invocation with metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; no dynamic code, network activity, or secrets; only static data assignments.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with obfuscated variable names. It reads description files, defines dependencies, and calls setup() with package metadata. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or malicious logic is present. The obfuscation appears stylistic or minimal, not malicious. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0 and low security risk scores. The obfuscation scores vary but are justified given the variable naming. Overall, the code poses negligible security risk and contains no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with obfuscated variable names. No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior is detected. The obfuscation is likely stylistic rather than malicious. The overall security posture is very low risk.",
