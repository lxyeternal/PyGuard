  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package, including reading description files and specifying dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' and 'HISTORY.rst' files, and static lists of dependencies.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function call, which installs dependencies and sets package metadata.",
  "flows": "Reading input files → storing content in variables → passing variables to setup() → package installation/configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are obfuscated with random strings, but they are only used as data containers; no suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscation is evident. No hardcoded credentials, network calls, or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The script reads two markdown files for description content and defines dependencies in lists with obfuscated variable names. These variables are then used as arguments in the setup() function. The setup() call includes standard package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No code injection, network activity, or malicious logic is present. Variable obfuscation appears to be a simple naming choice rather than malicious hiding. All operations are static and typical for a setup script.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup.py script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. The obfuscation is minimal and likely intended for code cleanliness or stylistic reasons. No security risks are detected.",
