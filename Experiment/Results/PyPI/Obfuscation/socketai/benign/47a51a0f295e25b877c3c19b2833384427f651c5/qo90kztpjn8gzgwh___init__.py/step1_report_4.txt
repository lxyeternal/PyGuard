    "Import of a module with a obfuscated name ('lcOwKBYMqrTBDckVqmWtdfBWaZZGWiIh') which could be malicious if the module is malicious"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code assigns seemingly arbitrary strings to variables, likely for configuration or metadata. The import statement is a standard Python import, but the module name appears obfuscated or intentionally obscure, which can sometimes be a red flag for malicious modules. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection. The variables themselves do not pose security risks. Without inspecting the imported module, no definitive malicious activity can be confirmed, but the obfuscated import warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not demonstrate explicit malicious behavior but includes an obfuscated import, which could be suspicious. No malicious activity or security risks are evident from this fragment alone.",
