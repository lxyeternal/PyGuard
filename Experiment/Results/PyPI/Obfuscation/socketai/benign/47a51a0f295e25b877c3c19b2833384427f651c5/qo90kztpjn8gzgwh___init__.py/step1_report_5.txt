  "anomalies": [
    "Use of seemingly random variable names that appear obfuscated",
    "Variables contain personal or version info but are not used further in this snippet",
    "The import path is relative; no indication of malicious code but warrants caution if module is compromised"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code assigns seemingly random strings to variables, which do not interact with each other or other code in this snippet. The import statement references a local module for exception handling. There is no evidence of data leakage, code injection, or malicious activity within this fragment. The obfuscated variable names may suggest an attempt to hide intent, but with only this code, no malicious behavior can be confirmed. The code structure itself is minimal and typical for a module that sets up exception handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment does not display explicit malicious behavior or malware. The variables are non-functional in this snippet and may serve as placeholders or obfuscation. The import appears standard for exception handling. Overall, there is no clear security threat but the obfuscated variable names warrant cautious review if this pattern appears elsewhere.",
