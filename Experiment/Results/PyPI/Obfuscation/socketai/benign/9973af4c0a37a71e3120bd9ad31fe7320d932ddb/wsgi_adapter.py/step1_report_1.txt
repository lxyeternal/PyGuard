{
  "purpose": "This code converts between Azure Functions HTTP requests and WSGI protocol, facilitating integration of WSGI applications with Azure Functions.",
  "sources": "Reads data from self._req (Azure Function HttpRequest), including headers, URL, body, and query parameters; also reads environment variables if enabled.",
  "sinks": "Uses untrusted input (HTTP request data) to construct WSGI environment; potentially affects response construction; logs errors; no direct data leakage observed.",
  "flows": "Request data flows from self._req to WSGI environment dictionary; response is built from WSGI application output and returned as HttpResponse.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names; code structure somewhat obscured but consistent with standard WSGI-Azure conversion. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a connector facilitating communication between Azure Functions and WSGI applications. It carefully constructs the environment from request data, handling headers, URL parsing, body decoding, and environment variable inclusion. There are no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The obfuscated names could be an attempt at concealment, but they do not perform malicious actions. The error logging is standard and does not leak sensitive data. Overall, the code is a standard implementation for Azure-WSGI integration without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard adapter for Azure Functions and WSGI, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation seems intentional but not malicious. No malware or malicious data flows are detected.",
