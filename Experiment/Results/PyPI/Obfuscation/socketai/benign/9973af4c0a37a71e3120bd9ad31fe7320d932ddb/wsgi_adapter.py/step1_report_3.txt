  "purpose": "Convert between Azure Functions API requests/responses and the WSGI protocol for Python web applications.",
  "sources": "Input data from 'req' (HTTP request), environment variables, and request headers.",
  "sinks": "Uses environment variables, request headers, and request body, and writes to logs and HTTP responses.",
  "flows": "Input from 'req' flows into request parsing methods, then data is processed and passed into WSGI app, and response is constructed back.",
  "anomalies": "The code employs obfuscated class and method names, which may be intended to conceal functionality. No explicit hardcoded secrets detected. No unusual data leaks or backdoors observed. Use of StringIO for error logging is common, but the purpose of some obfuscated functions could be scrutinized further.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily an adapter translating Azure Function HTTP requests to WSGI environment dicts, then executing a WSGI app, and returning the response. It processes headers and body, constructs environment variables, and handles error logging. No malicious network calls, code injections, or data exfiltration logic is apparent. The obfuscation of class/method names could be suspicious but is not conclusive evidence of malicious intent. All data flows seem consistent with standard request handling. No suspicious external domain connections or system modifications are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard Azure Functions to WSGI adapter with obfuscated identifiers. There are no evident malicious behaviors, backdoors, or security risks. Its purpose is to facilitate web application compatibility, not to perform any harmful activities.",
