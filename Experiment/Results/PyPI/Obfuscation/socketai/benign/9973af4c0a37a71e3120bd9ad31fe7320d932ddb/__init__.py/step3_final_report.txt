  "purpose": "Assessment of the obfuscated import statement from a local module, evaluating potential malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'qVwxKWEByIScKXICzMCFtYvkwaVGrXYo' from '.wsgi_adapter'.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of the imported symbol in code execution, data handling, or external communication, which could lead to malicious activity if the symbol is malicious.",
  "flows": "Import of obfuscated symbol from module -> usage of symbol in code (not provided) -> potential execution or data access points.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated symbol name and module name, minimal code snippet, lack of context, suspicion due to naming obscurity.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement importing an obfuscated symbol from a local module. All reports correctly identify the obfuscation and minimal code as suspicious but not definitively malicious. The scores assigned across reports (malware 0.2-0.3, obfuscated 0.75-0.8, risk 0.3-0.4) are consistent with the suspicion level. No evidence of malicious activity is present; obfuscation alone warrants further review of the module and usage. The scores appropriately reflect cautious suspicion without overestimating threat. Further dynamic analysis or inspection of the 'wsgi_adapter' module and how the symbol is used is recommended before making a final judgment.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is suspicious due to obfuscation but lacks concrete evidence of malicious activity. The scores are reasonable; a slight increase in obfuscation suspicion is justified, but malware and risk scores should remain moderate. Further investigation of the module and symbol usage is necessary for definitive assessment.",
