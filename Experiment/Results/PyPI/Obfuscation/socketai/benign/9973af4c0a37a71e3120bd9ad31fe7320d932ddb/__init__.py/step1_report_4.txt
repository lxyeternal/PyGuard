  "purpose": "Import a module or component named 'qVwxKWEByIScKXICzMCFtYvkwaVGrXYo' from the local package's 'wsgi_adapter' module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module 'wsgi_adapter'.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sink; import statement itself does not process external data.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow present in this single line.",
  "anomalies": "The imported symbol name 'qVwxKWEByIScKXICzMCFtYvkwaVGrXYo' appears as a random or obfuscated string, which could indicate obfuscation or malicious intent. The import path is relative, which is typical, but the module and symbol names are suspiciously nonsensical.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple relative import of a specific object or function from a module named 'wsgi_adapter'. The imported name 'qVwxKWEByIScKXICzMCFtYvkwaVGrXYo' is a non-descriptive, seemingly random string, which can be a sign of obfuscation or hiding malicious code. There are no other operations, input handling, or data flows present. The lack of context makes it difficult to determine intent solely from this line, but the naming pattern warrants suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "The code's primary concern is the use of an obfuscated or nonsensical symbol name in an import statement, which could suggest attempts to hide malicious behavior or obfuscate functionality. Without additional context, the code could be benign or malicious, but the suspicious naming increases risk awareness.",
