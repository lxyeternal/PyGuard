{
  "purpose": "Importing a module or class named qVwxKWEByIScKXICzMCFtYvkwaVGrXYo from a local package wsgi_adapter",
  "sources": "The import statement reads data from a local module within the package",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; import statement itself is benign, but could lead to indirect execution if qVwxKWEByIScKXICzMCFtYvkwaVGrXYo contains malicious code",
  "flows": "Import statement loads code from wsgi_adapter.qVwxKWEByIScKXICzMCFtYvkwaVGrXYo into current namespace",
  "anomalies": "Module name qVwxKWEByIScKXICzMCFtYvkwaVGrXYo appears obfuscated or intentionally obscure, which could be a red flag, but is not definitive evidence of malicious intent. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement importing a symbol with an obfuscated name from a local module. The filename and symbol name are unusual and could suggest obfuscation or concealment. There is no direct evidence of malicious behavior in this single line, but the obscurity warrants caution. Since the code is minimal, further inspection of the imported module is necessary for a comprehensive security assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code imports a seemingly obfuscated symbol from a local module, which could be an attempt to hide malicious behavior or simply obfuscation. On its own, the code does not demonstrate malicious activity but the obscurity should prompt further review of the imported module for potential malicious code.",
