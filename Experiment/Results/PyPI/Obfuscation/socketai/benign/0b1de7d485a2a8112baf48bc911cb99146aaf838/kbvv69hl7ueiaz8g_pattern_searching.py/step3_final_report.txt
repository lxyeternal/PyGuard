  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Use of eval/exec, network activity, environment variables, hardcoded strings, import statements, data handling functions.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, dynamic code execution points, data exfiltration paths.",
  "flows": "Sources such as eval/exec or network activity leading to potential data leaks or system compromise points.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation, dynamic code execution, suspicious import statements, hardcoded URLs or credentials, encoded strings, unusual control flow.",
  "analysis": "The code in Report 2 exhibits high obfuscation (score 0.9), dynamic execution (eval/exec), and network activity, justifying a malware score of 0.75 and high security risk (0.8). The other reports describe benign scripts with no suspicious patterns, justifying malware and obfuscation scores of 0 and low security risk (~0.2). The scores are consistent with the descriptions, and no adjustments are necessary given the evidence. The confidence in these assessments is high (0.9 for benign, 0.8 for suspicious).",
  "conclusion": "Report 2 indicates likely malicious and obfuscated code, warranting high malware and security risk scores. The remaining reports are benign, with low scores. Overall, the scoring aligns with the described behaviors, and no revisions are needed.",
