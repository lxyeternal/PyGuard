{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple Python script performing basic operations, potentially including user input, data processing, or output display.",
  "sources": "Any input functions such as input() or reading from files, environment variables, or network sources.",
  "sinks": "Potential output functions like print(), writing to files, or network transmission functions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources like user input or environment variables through processing functions to sinks like display or network output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic execution detected. No hidden backdoors or unusual code constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The script was reviewed for typical security issues, including insecure data handling, code injection points, and malicious behavior. No such issues were found. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard; no signs of obfuscation or malicious code patterns. The code structure is straightforward, and no anomalous behaviors are evident. The script does not connect to external domains, does not read sensitive data in an insecure manner, and does not perform any suspicious file or network operations.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code shows no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign, standard Python script. Confidence in this assessment is high.",
