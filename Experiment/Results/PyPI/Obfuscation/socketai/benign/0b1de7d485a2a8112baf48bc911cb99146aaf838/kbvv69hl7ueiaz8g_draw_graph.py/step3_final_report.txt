{
  "purpose": "The code is intended for data processing or utility functions, with no malicious behavior or sabotage evident.",
  "sources": "Input data sources such as function parameters, environment variables, or external files; no specific sources identified as malicious or suspicious.",
  "sinks": "Data outputs, network connections, or file writes; no untrusted data flows leading to security issues identified.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions to outputs; no malicious or suspicious flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The absence of suspicious network activity, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code constructs supports a benign assessment. High confidence (0.9) is justified due to the clear, standard code structure. No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected; security risk is minimal. The code's purpose appears to be utility-based, with no indicators of sabotage or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior identified. The scores are consistent with the analysis, indicating a very low security risk and no obfuscation. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety for use.",
