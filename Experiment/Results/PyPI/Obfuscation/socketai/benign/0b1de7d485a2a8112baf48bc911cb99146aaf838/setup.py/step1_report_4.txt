  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package 'gene_graph_lib', used to configure package metadata and install the library.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file, hardcoded strings for package name, version, author, description, URL, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data usage or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Reading file 'README.md' -> setting package metadata in setuptools.setup()",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated or inconsistent variable names (e.g., epGWtMRWUFyCLqgwJrydHRrpZlpGuSTo), but this appears to be an intentional obfuscation or naming pattern, not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. The code appears to be a standard setup script with nonsensical variable names, which could suggest an attempt to hide intent or obfuscate.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools, reads a 'README.md' file, and invokes setuptools.setup() with various parameters for package configuration. Variable names are unusual and appear obfuscated but are used consistently. No external or untrusted data is used beyond the static file read. No suspicious network activity, code injection, or malicious behavior is present. The obfuscation could be benign or an attempt to hide malicious intent, but based on the provided code, there is no direct evidence of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The script functions as a standard setup.py for package distribution, with unusual variable naming that might suggest obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious code, malware, or security risks in this snippet. The obfuscation alone does not indicate malicious intent.",
