  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'gene_graph_lib', configuring package metadata and reading README.md for long description.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file; no other data sources or input points.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data or external effects present.",
  "flows": "Reads file content into variable, passes variables to setuptools.setup() without dynamic execution or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated variable names (e.g., 'epGWtMRWUFyCLqgwJrydHRrpZlpGuSTo'), which is unusual for such scripts but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python library, with no malicious code, network activity, or data leaks. The only anomaly is superficial obfuscation via nonsensical variable names, which does not indicate malicious intent. The code performs standard operations: reading a file and calling setuptools.setup() with package info. No code injection, secrets, or external communication are present. The obfuscation may be stylistic or an attempt to hinder readability but does not constitute malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard package configuration with superficial obfuscation. No evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, or security risks. The obfuscation alone is not sufficient to classify it as malicious, and the code appears safe for use.",
