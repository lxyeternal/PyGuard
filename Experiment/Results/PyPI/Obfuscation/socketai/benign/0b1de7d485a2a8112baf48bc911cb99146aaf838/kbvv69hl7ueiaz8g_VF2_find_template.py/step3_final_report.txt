  "purpose": "Analysis of code for supply chain security, malicious behavior, and risks in open source Python dependencies.",
  "sources": "Code input points such as environment variables, user inputs, file reads, network connections, dynamic code execution (eval/exec).",
  "sinks": "Network transmission, file system modifications, environment variable access, system commands, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources to sinks via data processing, environment reads, or dynamic execution pathways.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation, use of eval/exec, misleading variable names, complex constructs, hardcoded secrets, unexplained dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are common in malicious payloads. The high obfuscation score (0.8) is justified. The malware suspicion is moderate (0.4), but given the obfuscation and potential for malicious intent, increasing the malware score to 0.6 better reflects the risk. The overall security risk score (0.6) is appropriate, indicating a significant concern that warrants caution. No malicious activity is confirmed, but the suspicious features justify elevated scores. The other reports are consistent with their descriptions, showing benign or absent code, with low or zero scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code in Report 4 exhibits obfuscation and dynamic execution, raising suspicion of malicious intent; scores are adjusted to reflect this. Other reports are consistent with benign or absent code. The overall security posture suggests caution with obfuscated dependencies exhibiting signs of potential malicious behavior.",
