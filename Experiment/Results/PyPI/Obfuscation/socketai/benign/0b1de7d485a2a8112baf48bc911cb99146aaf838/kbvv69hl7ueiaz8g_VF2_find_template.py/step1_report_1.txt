{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script intended for general utility or application logic, with no immediately obvious malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly evident; there are no visible functions or calls to input(), read files, environment variables, or network inputs.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system commands are present that process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are identifiable; the code does not handle external input or data flows that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not contain hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs. There are no suspicious imports or dynamic executions observed.",
  "analysis": "A thorough review indicates the code is either incomplete or minimal with no evident external data handling, network communication, or malicious constructs. The absence of input handling, network operations, or system modifications reduces suspicion. The code's structure and imports seem standard, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious patterns. Without additional context or more code, no malicious behaviors are identified.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with no suspicious activities or security issues detected.",
