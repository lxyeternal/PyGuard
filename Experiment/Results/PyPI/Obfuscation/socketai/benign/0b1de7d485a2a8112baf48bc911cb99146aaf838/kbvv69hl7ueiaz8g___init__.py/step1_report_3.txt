  "sources": "The string literal 'gene_graph_lib' assigned directly to a variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow to external systems are present.",
  "flows": "The data flows from the string literal to the variable SYRIolCatacAYTtbFPigXxfRYUPrLten.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable name with a long, seemingly random string; no clear purpose or usage shown.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains a single assignment statement with a long, obfuscated variable name. No input reading, no output, no external data handling, and no suspicious function calls. The variable name is non-descriptive, which may suggest obfuscation, but there is no evidence of malicious intent or behavior. No code execution or data leaks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple variable assignment with a nonsensical variable name. There is no indication of malicious behavior, malicious intent, or security risks based on this snippet alone.",
