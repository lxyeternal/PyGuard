{
  "purpose": "Assigns the string 'gene_graph_lib' to an obfuscated variable name, likely for internal or placeholder use.",
  "sources": "No external inputs or data sources; only a static string assignment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data leakage, external communication, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Single flow from variable assignment to variable storage; no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable name without context; no malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward assignment of a string to an obfuscated variable name. No external inputs, outputs, or complex logic are involved. The obfuscation alone does not imply malicious intent; it could be for internal naming or code generation. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, with scores reflecting the obfuscation but no malicious activity. Malware scores are zero, security risks are minimal, and confidence levels are high. The obfuscation score is moderate, justified by the variable name's nonsensical appearance. Overall, the code is benign, with no signs of sabotage or security threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is a benign, simple variable assignment with obfuscated naming. No malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks are evident. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and no further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.6,
