  "purpose": "Assigning a string 'gene_graph_lib' to the variable SYRIolCatacAYTtbFPigXxfRYUPrLten.",
  "sources": "The code reads a string literal assigned to a variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks detected; no untrusted data sources or outputs.",
  "flows": "N/A - simple assignment; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable name with a seemingly random or obfuscated string; no further context or code present.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a single line where a variable is assigned a string value. The variable name appears intentionally obfuscated or nonsensical, which may be a sign of obfuscation or hiding intent. There are no inputs, outputs, or function calls present to evaluate for malicious data flow. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code are evident in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple variable assignment with an obfuscated variable name. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this isolated snippet. The obfuscated variable name alone does not indicate malicious intent, but it warrants further review if part of a larger codebase.",
