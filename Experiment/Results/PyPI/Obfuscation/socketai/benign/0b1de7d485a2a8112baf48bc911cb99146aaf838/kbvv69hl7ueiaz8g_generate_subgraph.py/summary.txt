  "conclusion": "Overall, the code appears mostly benign with low security risks. The moderate suspicion in Report 2 justifies a malware score around 0.2–0.4, obfuscation around 0.1–0.3, and risk around 0.2–0.3. No significant malicious activity is confirmed, but continued review of suspicious patterns is recommended."
