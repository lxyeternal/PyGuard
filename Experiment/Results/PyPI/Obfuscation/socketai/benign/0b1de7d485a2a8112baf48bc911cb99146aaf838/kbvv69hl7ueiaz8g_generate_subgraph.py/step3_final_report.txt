  "purpose": "Evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and anomalies based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Potential sources include environment variables, dynamic code execution functions (eval, exec), data handling points, network connections, and input/output operations.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows to eval/exec, network transmissions, file system modifications, or environment variables that could lead to data leakage or system compromise.",
  "flows": "Sources such as user input or environment variables flow into eval/exec or network functions; data exfiltration or code execution occurs at these sinks, possibly via obfuscated or dynamic code.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated code, dynamic execution functions, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious network connections; unusual import patterns or environment manipulations.",
  "analysis": "The reports consistently indicate that most code snippets are benign, with scores reflecting low malware and obfuscation levels. Report 2 suggests moderate suspicion due to potential dynamic code execution and data handling concerns, justifying higher scores. Other reports show no anomalies or malicious indicators. The scores align with the descriptions, and confidence levels are appropriate given the limited context. No concrete evidence of malicious code is present, but suspicion in Report 2 warrants cautious monitoring.",
  "conclusion": "Overall, the code appears mostly benign with low security risks. The moderate suspicion in Report 2 justifies a malware score around 0.2–0.4, obfuscation around 0.1–0.3, and risk around 0.2–0.3. No significant malicious activity is confirmed, but continued review of suspicious patterns is recommended.",
