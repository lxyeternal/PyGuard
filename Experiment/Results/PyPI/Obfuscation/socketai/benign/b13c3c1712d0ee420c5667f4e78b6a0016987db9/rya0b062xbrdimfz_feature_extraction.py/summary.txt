  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated but performs legitimate data preprocessing tasks for time series analysis. No evidence of malware, sabotage, or malicious activity is present. The obfuscation is likely for IP protection or to hinder reverse engineering, not malicious intent. The current scores are justified and should remain as is."
