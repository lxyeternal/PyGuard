  "purpose": "Complex data transformers for time series and sequential data preprocessing, involving windowing, differencing, Fourier transforms, shifting, and feature stacking.",
  "sources": "Array inputs representing time series data, read within class methods through slicing and indexing.",
  "sinks": "Processed numpy arrays, concatenated or stacked internally; no external data leaks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays through slicing, differencing, Fourier feature generation, shifting, and stacking operations within methods.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with nonsensical class and method names; no hardcoded secrets, credentials, or network/system modifications; standard numpy/scikit-learn routines.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard time series feature extraction and transformation routines, albeit with obfuscated identifiers. No suspicious network activity, file I/O, or system modifications are present. The obfuscation appears to be for concealment or IP protection rather than malicious intent. The operations are typical in data preprocessing pipelines. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or sabotage are detected. The obfuscation scores are high, justified by naming, but do not indicate malicious behavior. The malware score is zero, consistent with the absence of malicious activity. The security risk score remains low, reflecting the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated but performs legitimate data preprocessing tasks for time series analysis. No evidence of malware, sabotage, or malicious activity is present. The obfuscation is likely for IP protection or to hinder reverse engineering, not malicious intent. The current scores are justified and should remain as is.",
