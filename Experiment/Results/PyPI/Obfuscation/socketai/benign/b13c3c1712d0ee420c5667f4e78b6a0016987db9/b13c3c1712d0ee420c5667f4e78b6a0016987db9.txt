      "obfuscated": 0.8,
      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation and suspicious import patterns, which warrant caution. While no explicit malicious activity is confirmed, the obfuscation and import from an obscure module suggest a moderate to high security concern. Further investigation into the 'skits' module and the purpose of the obfuscated parameter is recommended."

      "conclusion": "The code is an obfuscated data preprocessing pipeline for time series data, with no direct evidence of malicious activity or malware. The suspicious import and obfuscated naming warrant further verification, but based solely on this code, it appears benign. The high obfuscation score reflects the difficulty in interpreting the code, but malware and malicious behavior are unlikely."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated but legitimate-looking machine learning pipeline implementation. No active malware signals are detected. The primary concerns are the obfuscation and the suspicious import 'skits.preprocessing', which should be further investigated. The malware score is set to 0.2 to reflect cautious suspicion due to obfuscation and import anomalies. The obfuscation score remains high at 0.85, justified by variable naming and dynamic calls. The security risk score is moderate at 0.3, considering obfuscation and the suspicious import but no direct malicious activity."

      "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated but performs legitimate data preprocessing tasks for time series analysis. No evidence of malware, sabotage, or malicious activity is present. The obfuscation is likely for IP protection or to hinder reverse engineering, not malicious intent. The current scores are justified and should remain as is."
