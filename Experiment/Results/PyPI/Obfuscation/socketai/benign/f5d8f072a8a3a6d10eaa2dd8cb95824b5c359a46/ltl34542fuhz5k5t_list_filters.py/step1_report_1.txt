  "purpose": "Define custom Django admin list filters for FBG and OGTT values based on specific thresholds.",
  "sources": "Input request parameters via methods like 'bTvcjMXBFexGGZkLYIHdBzNsswvxlQEc' which access filter choices, and 'hUvZzYgsCmaYRNNCvgNoepCTBeiAOlnW' (likely to retrieve selected filter value).",
  "sinks": "Filtering methods 'filter()' on queryset objects, which use untrusted input from request parameters to filter data based on decimal thresholds.",
  "flows": "User selects filter options → methods retrieve selected filter criteria → filter() applies conditions to queryset based on these criteria.",
  "anomalies": "The method 'hUvZzYgsCmaYRNNCvgNoepCTBeiAOlnW' is called multiple times; its implementation is missing, which obscures how filter values are retrieved. The method name appears obfuscated and non-descriptive. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns are evident. No malicious code or external network activity present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two Django SimpleListFilter subclasses for filtering diabetes-related metrics. The filter methods rely on the return value of 'hUvZzYgsCmaYRNNCvgNoepCTBeiAOlnW' to determine filter criteria. Since the implementation of this method is absent, it's unclear whether it retrieves data securely or maliciously. The rest of the code involves standard filtering logic with no signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or malicious data handling. No external network calls, system modifications, or data exfiltration code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements standard Django admin filters with obfuscated method names for retrieving filter criteria. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident. The only concern is the unclear implementation of 'hUvZzYgsCmaYRNNCvgNoepCTBeiAOlnW', which, if malicious, could affect filter behavior, but there's no direct evidence of malicious intent.",
