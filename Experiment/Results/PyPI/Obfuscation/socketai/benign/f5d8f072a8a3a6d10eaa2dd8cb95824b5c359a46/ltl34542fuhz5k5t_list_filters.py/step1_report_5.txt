  "purpose": "Define custom Django admin list filters for FBG and OGTT values based on specific thresholds.",
  "sources": "Input data from Django request objects and filter parameters; model admin filters.",
  "sinks": "Filtering operations on querysets based on user-selected filter options.",
  "flows": "Request parameters (filter selections) -> methods determining filter criteria -> queryset filtering.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated-like class and method names; no hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom Django admin filters, each with title labels and filter options. Methods intended to retrieve filter choice and apply filtering based on the selected option. The filter options are based on decimal thresholds for medical measurements. Method names are non-standard and obfuscated but do not indicate malicious intent. No data leakage, external network activity, or malicious behavior observed. The code appears to implement legitimate filtering functionality with no suspicious or malicious behavior. No obfuscation is detected beyond non-standard naming, which may be intentionally obscure but is not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to implement legitimate Django admin filters with no malicious intent or security risks. The obfuscated class and method names are unusual but do not indicate malicious behavior. No malware or security issues detected.",
