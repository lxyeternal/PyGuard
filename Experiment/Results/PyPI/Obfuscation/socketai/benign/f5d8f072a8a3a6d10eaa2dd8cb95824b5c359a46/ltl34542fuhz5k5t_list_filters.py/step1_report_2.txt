  "purpose": "Define custom filters for FBG and OGTT values in Django admin interface",
  "sources": "Request data via self.hUvZzYgsCmaYRNNCvgNoepCTBeiAOlnW() method calls",
  "sinks": "Filtering database queries using values returned from self.hUvZzYgsCmaYRNNCvgNoepCTBeiAOlnW()",
  "flows": "User-selected filter options (fbg_normal, fbg_high, ogtt_normal, ogtt_high) → method calls → query filters",
  "anomalies": "Unusual method naming conventions, the repeated call to self.hUvZzYgsCmaYRNNCvgNoepCTBeiAOlnW() without visible implementation; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code defines two Django admin filter classes with obfuscated class names and attribute names. Each class provides filter options for medical measurements (FBG and OGTT). The methods that determine filter choices and apply filtering rely on a method self.hUvZzYgsCmaYRNNCvgNoepCTBeiAOlnW(), which appears to retrieve the current filter selection, but the implementation of this method is not provided. The code simply filters querysets based on these values using Decimal comparisons. No suspicious code, external network access, or malicious behavior is evident. The unusual naming is likely obfuscation or stylistic, not malicious. Overall, this appears to be standard Django filter code with obfuscated identifiers.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of Django admin filters with obfuscated naming; there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It only filters database records based on user input, with no indication of data leakage, backdoors, or malware.",
