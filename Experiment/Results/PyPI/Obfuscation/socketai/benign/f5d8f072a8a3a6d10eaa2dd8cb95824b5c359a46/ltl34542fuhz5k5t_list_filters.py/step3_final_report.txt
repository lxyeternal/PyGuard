{
  "purpose": "Defines Django admin list filters for FBG and OGTT values, allowing filtering based on user-selected thresholds.",
  "sources": "User-selected filter options retrieved via obfuscated method, filter fields 'fbg_value' and 'ogtt_value'.",
  "sinks": "Application of filter conditions on queryset; no external data or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "User selects filter -> method retrieves selection -> filter applies condition based on selection -> queryset filtered accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names; missing implementation of 'hUvZzYgsCmaYRNNCvgNoepCTBeiAOlnW()' which retrieves filter choice.",
  "analysis": "The code implements straightforward filtering logic based on decimal thresholds for FBG and OGTT. The obfuscation of class and method names raises suspicion but does not indicate malicious activity. The key unknown is the implementation of the method that retrieves filter choice; without it, full verification isn't possible. No external calls, network activity, or malicious code are present. The filtering logic is standard and safe. The obfuscation may be stylistic or intended to conceal details but does not inherently imply malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard Django admin filters with obfuscated identifiers. No evidence of malicious behavior or security risks is detected. The main concern is the obfuscated method whose implementation is missing, which warrants further review. Scores of malware 0 and low security risk are appropriate given the current information.",
