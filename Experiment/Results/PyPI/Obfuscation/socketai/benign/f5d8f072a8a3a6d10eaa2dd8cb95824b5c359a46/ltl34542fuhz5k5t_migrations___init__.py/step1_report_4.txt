  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports are detected. The code structure appears standard without unusual language features or misleading variables.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed step-by-step, focusing on input/output points, data handling, and function calls. No malicious payloads or suspicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system damage, are evident. The lack of documentation limits full understanding, but based on available information, no malicious activity is apparent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no clear signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with no evident malware or supply chain threats. However, due to limited context, some uncertainty remains.",
