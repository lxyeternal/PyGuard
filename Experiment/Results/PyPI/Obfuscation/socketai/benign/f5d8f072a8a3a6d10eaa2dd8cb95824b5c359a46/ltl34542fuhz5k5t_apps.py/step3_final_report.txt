{
  "purpose": "Obfuscated Django app configuration class with static string attributes.",
  "sources": "Import statement from django.apps, class definition, static attribute assignments.",
  "sinks": "No external input, network activity, or data processing observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static attribute assignments without external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of class and attribute names; static string values that seem placeholders.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class with a nonsensical alias, defines a subclass with an obfuscated name, and sets static string attributes. There is no evidence of data flow, external communication, or malicious behavior. The obfuscation appears superficial, possibly for concealment or stylistic reasons. The static nature and lack of active logic suggest benign intent, though obfuscation warrants cautious scoring.",
  "conclusion": "The code is an obfuscated but benign Django configuration class with no evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware and risk scores should remain low given the absence of active malicious behavior.",
