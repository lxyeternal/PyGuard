  "purpose": "Define a Django application configuration class with custom class name and attributes.",
  "sources": "Import statement for Django apps, class definition, attribute assignments.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or leaks occur.",
  "flows": "Import statement -> class definition -> attribute assignment; no data flow involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "Use of non-descriptive, obfuscated class and variable names; no actual malicious code or external calls; class attributes contain hardcoded strings that appear benign.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a Django application configuration class using an unusual alias, then defines a subclass with an obfuscated name, setting two class attributes with string values that appear harmless. No external data handling, network operations, or code execution is present. The obfuscation may be suspicious but in this context seems to serve obfuscation or naming obscurity rather than malicious intent. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code injection.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a simple Django app config with obfuscated naming; there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation is likely for code concealment or stylistic reasons rather than malicious intent.",
