{
  "purpose": "Defines a Django application configuration class with non-descriptive names and string attributes.",
  "sources": "The code reads nothing from external input; it only defines a class and assigns string literals.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to external systems or untrusted data sources are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from input to output; the code only contains static class and variable definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated or non-descriptive class and attribute names, which could be an attempt to hide intent or function.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a Django class using an obscure alias, then defines a subclass with similarly obscure naming. It assigns string literals 'edc_glucose' and 'Edc Glucose' to class variables. There are no input sources, no data processing, network operations, or security-sensitive actions. The naming pattern might suggest intent to conceal, but there's no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be an obfuscated or intentionally obscure class definition with no evident malicious behavior or security risks. The unusual naming could be suspicious, but without further context, it remains a benign structural code snippet.",
