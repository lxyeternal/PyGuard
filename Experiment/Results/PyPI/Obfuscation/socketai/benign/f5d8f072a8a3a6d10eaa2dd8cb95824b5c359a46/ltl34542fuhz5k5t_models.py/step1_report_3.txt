  "purpose": "The purpose of this code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be a Python package meant for general use, possibly involving network operations or data processing.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, hardcoded strings, and potentially external network calls or file reads (if present in the full code).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, data transmissions, file writes, or execution of dynamic code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (environment variables, hardcoded data) through processing functions, potentially reaching network or system-level sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious network domains, or hidden code structures detected. However, without full code context, cannot definitively rule out malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "Initial code review shows standard structure with imports and function definitions. No malicious patterns like obfuscated code, unusual dynamic execution, or suspicious variable naming. If network or system operations are present, they seem typical but could be examined further with more context. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors identified in this segment. Code appears to be straightforward and clean.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no clear signs of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. The code seems benign, but further review of the full code and runtime behavior would be necessary for a definitive assessment.",
