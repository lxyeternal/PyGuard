{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility function within a Python package, though the specific intent is not explicitly stated.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from variables, possibly from function arguments or external environment variables, but no explicit input sources such as files, network, or user input are clearly shown.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, data output, or file writing if present, but the provided code does not explicitly demonstrate such sinks.",
  "flows": "Without explicit input or output code, there are no clear source-to-sink data flows. The code processes internal variables, with no evident untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious function calls, or unusual code constructs are identified. No obfuscated code or misleading variable names are present. The code structure is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "A step-by-step review shows that the code consists of standard Python functions and logic. It does not include any dynamic code execution, network activity, or access to sensitive system features. The absence of external data sources or sinks indicates low risk. The code appears to be a benign utility or logic implementation without malicious intent or security flaws.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malware. It appears safe for use in a Python package.",
