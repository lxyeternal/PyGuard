  "purpose": "Retrieve the value of 'EDC_GLUCOSE_HIGH_READING' from Django settings with a default of 9999.99.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from Django settings using getattr(settings, ...).",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data outputs are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The data flows from the Django settings into a variable, with no further processing or output.",
  "anomalies": "The variable name 'uzOqFUBbuKlGHAAdgXKeViXvjIOvUFHp' appears obfuscated, but it is assigned a static setting value; no malicious code or suspicious patterns are evident. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django settings and retrieves a configuration value with a default fallback. The variable name is obfuscated but does not inherently indicate malicious intent. There are no inputs from external sources besides Django settings, which are typically controlled by the application environment. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behaviors are observed. The use of getattr with a default is standard practice for configuration retrieval.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply reads a configuration value from Django settings, with an obfuscated variable name. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks in this snippet.",
