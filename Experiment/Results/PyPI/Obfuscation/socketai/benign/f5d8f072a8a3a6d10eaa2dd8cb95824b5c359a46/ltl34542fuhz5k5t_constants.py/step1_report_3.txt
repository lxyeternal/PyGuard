  "purpose": "Retrieve the value of the setting 'EDC_GLUCOSE_HIGH_READING' from Django settings with a default of 9999.99",
  "sources": "The code reads data from Django's settings module using getattr",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input; the code only reads a configuration value",
  "flows": "Data flows from the settings module to the variable uzOqFUBbuKlGHAAdgXKeViXvjIOvUFHp",
  "anomalies": "Use of an obfuscated variable name may suggest concealment; no other suspicious code present",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django settings and retrieves a configuration value with a default. The variable name appears obfuscated, but this does not inherently indicate malicious intent. No user input, network activity, or sensitive data handling occurs. The purpose is likely configuration management. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply accesses a configuration setting with an obfuscated variable name. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation may be for code concealment, but it does not indicate malicious intent.",
