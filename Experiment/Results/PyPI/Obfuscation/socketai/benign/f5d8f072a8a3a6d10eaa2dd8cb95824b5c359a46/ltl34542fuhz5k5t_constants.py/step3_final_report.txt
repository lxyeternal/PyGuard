  "purpose": "Retrieve the configuration value 'EDC_GLUCOSE_HIGH_READING' from Django settings with a default of 9999.99.",
  "sources": "The code reads from Django settings via getattr(settings, 'EDC_GLUCOSE_HIGH_READING', 9999.99).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed or transmitted; the code only accesses configuration data.",
  "flows": "The source is the settings object; the value is assigned to an obfuscated variable; no further flow occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The variable name 'uzOqFUBbuKlGHAAdgXKeViXvjIOvUFHp' is obfuscated, which could be suspicious but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward retrieval of a configuration parameter from Django settings, assigning it to an obfuscated variable. No malicious code, data leaks, or network activity are present. The obfuscation of the variable name is noted but does not imply malicious intent. The malware score is 0, security risk is minimal (~0.1-0.2), and obfuscation suspicion is moderate (~0.4). The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions suggest it is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration access with obfuscated variable naming. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues. The obfuscation is likely a stylistic choice or minor concealment, not malicious activity.",
