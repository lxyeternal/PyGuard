  "purpose": "Retrieve the 'EDC_GLUCOSE_HIGH_READING' setting from Django settings, defaulting to 9999.99 if not set.",
  "sources": "Accessing Django settings via getattr on 'settings' object",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present in this code",
  "flows": "Reading from Django settings (trusted source) - no flow leading to data leak or malicious effect",
  "anomalies": "Variable name 'uzOqFUBbuKlGHAAdgXKeViXvjIOvUFHp' appears obfuscated and nonsensical, which could indicate an attempt to hide malicious intent or malicious code obfuscation. The code itself is simple and standard, but the variable name is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward retrieval of a configuration value from Django settings with a default fallback. The variable name is highly obfuscated, which is unusual for benign code and could suggest obfuscation to hide malicious intent or simply a bad practice. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or network activity. No malicious payload or dangerous behavior is evident in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself performs a benign configuration fetch with an obfuscated variable name. While the core logic is safe, the obfuscated variable name raises suspicion, but there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks within this code fragment.",
