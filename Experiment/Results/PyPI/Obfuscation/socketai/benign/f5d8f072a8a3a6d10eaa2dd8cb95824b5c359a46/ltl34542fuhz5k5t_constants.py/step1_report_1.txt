  "purpose": "Retrieve the value of the 'EDC_GLUCOSE_HIGH_READING' setting from Django settings, defaulting to 9999.99 if not set.",
  "sources": "getattr(settings, 'EDC_GLUCOSE_HIGH_READING', 9999.99)",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data leading to data leaks or malicious actions",
  "flows": "The code reads from Django settings, assigns to a variable but does not process further",
  "anomalies": "The variable name appears obfuscated, which may suggest an attempt to conceal its purpose; however, this alone is not definitive",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Django settings object and retrieves a specific configuration value using getattr. The variable name is non-descriptive, potentially for obfuscation. No data is being transmitted or executed, and no user input is involved. The code's simplicity indicates standard configuration access, but the obfuscated variable name warrants scrutiny. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code execution, or network communication.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to simply access a configuration setting with an obfuscated variable name. There are no clear signs of malicious intent or suspicious activity. The obfuscation could be benign or an attempt to conceal purpose, but on its own, it does not indicate malicious behavior.",
