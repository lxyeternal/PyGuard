      "conclusion": "The code snippets analyzed do not exhibit malicious behavior or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, and the malware likelihood is effectively zero. The current scores are appropriate; minor adjustments to risk scores could be made but are not necessary. Overall, the supply chain security posture of these dependencies appears sound based on the provided snippets."

      "conclusion": "Most code snippets are benign with low security risks. Report 2 shows signs of obfuscation and suspicious patterns, warranting higher scores. The current scoring system is consistent with the descriptions. Unless concrete malicious actions are confirmed, the overall malware score should remain low (~0.2), with Report 2 at approximately 0.65. Obfuscation scores should reflect signs of code complexity, with Report 2 at 0.7. The security risk remains low overall, with a slight increase for Report 2. These assessments are cautious but justified based on the evidence."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard Django admin filters with obfuscated identifiers. No evidence of malicious behavior or security risks is detected. The main concern is the obfuscated method whose implementation is missing, which warrants further review. Scores of malware 0 and low security risk are appropriate given the current information."

      "conclusion": "The code snippets are largely benign, with minimal to no malicious activity detected. Suspicious features such as obfuscation and dynamic code execution are present in some reports but do not confirm malicious intent. The scores are appropriate; a slight increase in malware suspicion for Report 3 is recommended to better reflect its features. Overall, the supply chain security posture appears low risk, with no active threats identified."
