{
  "purpose": "The code imports and executes a function named func_main2, passing specific test module and test directory names, likely to run tests or perform some setup related to the 'edc_glucose' project.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only calls a function with static string arguments.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present as there is no processing of untrusted data or network interaction; the function call is internal.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks are evident in this code.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python entry point that imports a function from a module and executes it with fixed string arguments. There is no indication of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security issues. The absence of dynamic input, network calls, or obfuscated code suggests low risk. The only potential concern might be the behavior of 'func_main2', but that cannot be assessed here as its implementation is not provided.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple script to run a test or initialization function within a project. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident from this snippet.",
