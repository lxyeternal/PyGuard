{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to run a main function from an imported module, likely for testing or setup purposes within the 'edc_glucose' project.",
  "sources": "The code reads no user input or external data directly; it imports a function and calls it with hardcoded string arguments.",
  "sinks": "The function 'func_main2' could potentially perform various actions based on the provided strings, but without its implementation, specific sinks cannot be confirmed.",
  "flows": "The script calls 'func_main2' with fixed arguments, so any internal processing within 'func_main2' is a black box. No external data flows are evident here.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. The script is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a single function and executes it with static string parameters, which appear to reference test modules and directories. There is no evidence of malicious behavior in this snippet. The actual security implications depend on the implementation of 'func_main2', which is not provided. The code itself is simple, clear, and typical for test or setup scripts, with no suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and does not exhibit any signs of malicious intent or security risks based on the provided snippet. Its purpose seems to be to invoke a testing or configuration function with fixed parameters. No malicious behavior or anomalies are detected in this code fragment.",
