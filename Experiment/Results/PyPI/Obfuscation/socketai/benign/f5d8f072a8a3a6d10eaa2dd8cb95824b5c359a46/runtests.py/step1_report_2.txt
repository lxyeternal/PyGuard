{
  "purpose": "To invoke the function 'func_main2' with specific test module and test directory names, likely for running tests or processing configurations.",
  "sources": "The script imports 'func_main2' from 'edc_test_settings.func_main' and calls it with string arguments indicating test modules and directories.",
  "sinks": "The function call 'func_main2' is a potential sink, depending on what 'func_main2' does with its arguments. If 'func_main2' executes code or interacts with external systems, these could be points of concern.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from the hardcoded string arguments passed to 'func_main2'. The flow depends on the internal implementation of 'func_main2', which is not provided.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns are evident in this small code snippet. The code appears straightforward, invoking a function with string parameters.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific function and calls it within a main guard. The arguments are static strings referencing test modules and directories. Without the implementation of 'func_main2', it is impossible to determine if the function performs malicious actions. The code structure itself is standard and does not contain obfuscated elements or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this snippet, there is no clear evidence of malicious behavior. The code's intent appears to be related to testing or configuration. No malicious activity or security risks are evident from the code provided.",
