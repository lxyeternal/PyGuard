{
  "purpose": "The script appears to invoke a function 'func_main2' with specific test-related string arguments, likely to run or manage tests in a Python project.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports a function and calls it with hardcoded string arguments.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, 'func_main2' could process the provided strings, which seem to specify test modules or test suites. If 'func_main2' executes code based on these strings, it might pose a risk depending on its implementation.",
  "flows": "The script calls 'func_main2' with static strings; any flow of untrusted data depends entirely on 'func_main2's implementation, which is not shown here.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, but the use of specific test strings might suggest an intention to run tests dynamically. No suspicious or malicious code, such as network operations, environment variable usage, or file manipulations, is visible.",
  "analysis": "This code is a straightforward entry point that imports and calls a function with predefined string parameters related to test modules. There are no signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious actions within this snippet. Any security concerns depend on the implementation of 'func_main2'. If 'func_main2' executes arbitrary code or test scripts based on these strings, there could be a risk, but that cannot be determined from this code alone.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a simple test runner invocation with static parameters. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks on its own, but caution should be exercised if 'func_main2' executes untrusted code based on its arguments.",
