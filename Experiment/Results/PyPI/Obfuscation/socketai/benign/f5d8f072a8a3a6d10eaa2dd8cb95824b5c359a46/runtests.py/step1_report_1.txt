{
  "purpose": "The code appears to invoke a main function from an imported module, likely for testing or configuration purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module 'edc_test_settings.func_main' and its function 'func_main2'. No user input or external data sources are explicitly read within this snippet.",
  "sinks": "The function 'func_main2' is called with string arguments that seem to reference test modules or test data; potential sinks depend on what 'func_main2' does internally, but no direct data leak or malicious sink is visible here.",
  "flows": "The source (imported function) is invoked with static string arguments; there are no data flows from untrusted sources in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns are present. The code structure is straightforward and typical for a test invocation.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a function and calls it within the main guard. It passes string literals that likely specify test modules or test configurations. The code does not include any input/output, network activity, or suspicious logic. The minimalistic structure suggests standard test or configuration code without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears benign, serving as an entry point to run a specific test or configuration function. There is no indication of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet.",
