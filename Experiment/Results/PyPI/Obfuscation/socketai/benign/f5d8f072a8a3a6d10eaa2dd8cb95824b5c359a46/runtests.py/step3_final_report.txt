{
  "purpose": "Invoke the function 'func_main2' with specific test module strings, likely for test execution or setup.",
  "sources": "Static import of 'func_main2' and static string arguments within the main guard.",
  "sinks": "The behavior of 'func_main2' depends on its implementation; potential sinks are within that function.",
  "flows": "Source: static strings passed to 'func_main2'; Sink: execution within 'func_main2' based on those strings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward function call with static arguments, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function and calls it with fixed string arguments under the main guard, indicating a test or setup script. No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The security implications depend entirely on 'func_main2's implementation, which is unknown. The code itself shows no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or secrets. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting dependency risk rather than code risk. The confidence in this assessment is high (above 0.9).",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and straightforward, with no direct malicious activity. The primary concern is the behavior of 'func_main2', which cannot be evaluated here. The current scores are appropriate and conservative, indicating low risk and no malware suspicion.",
