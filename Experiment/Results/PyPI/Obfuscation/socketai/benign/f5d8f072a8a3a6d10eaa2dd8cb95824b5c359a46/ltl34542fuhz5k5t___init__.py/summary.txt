  "conclusion": "Most code snippets are benign with low security risks. Report 2 shows signs of obfuscation and suspicious patterns, warranting higher scores. The current scoring system is consistent with the descriptions. Unless concrete malicious actions are confirmed, the overall malware score should remain low (~0.2), with Report 2 at approximately 0.65. Obfuscation scores should reflect signs of code complexity, with Report 2 at 0.7. The security risk remains low overall, with a slight increase for Report 2. These assessments are cautious but justified based on the evidence."
