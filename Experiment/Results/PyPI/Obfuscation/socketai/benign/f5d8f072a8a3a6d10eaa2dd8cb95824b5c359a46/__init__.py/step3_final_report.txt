  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python code snippets for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, network requests, file operations, input data, system commands.",
  "sinks": "Network endpoints, file system, environment variables, system commands.",
  "flows": "Sources (inputs/env vars) to sinks (network/file/system) without evidence of malicious data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal or placeholder code, no suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no backdoors.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify the code as either empty, placeholder, or benign utility scripts. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious activity are evident. Risk scores are generally low and justified; some opacity in minimal code warrants cautious scoring but no concrete evidence of malicious intent. Confidence levels are appropriate given the limited information. The scores are consistent with the analysis, with minor room for adjustment to reflect the low threat level.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets analyzed do not exhibit malicious behavior or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, and the malware likelihood is effectively zero. The current scores are appropriate; minor adjustments to risk scores could be made but are not necessary. Overall, the supply chain security posture of these dependencies appears sound based on the provided snippets.",
