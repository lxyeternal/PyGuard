  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be related to data processing or system automation, but without specific context, it is unclear.",
  "sources": "Input functions, environment variables, file reads, or network requests (if present in the code).",
  "sinks": "Potentially dangerous operations such as executing system commands, writing to sensitive files, or network communications.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs/env variables) to sinks (system commands, network).",
  "anomalies": "Any hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs such as dynamic code execution or indirect imports.",
  "analysis": "The code needs to be reviewed carefully to identify data sources, sinks, and flow paths. Look for hardcoded credentials, suspicious network calls, or code that manipulates system state in unexpected ways. Check for obfuscation techniques or misleading variable names. Determine if any untrusted input can influence critical operations.",
  "conclusion": "No explicit malicious behavior identified based on provided code. The code appears typical, but without seeing specific data sources or sinks, a definitive judgment cannot be made. The overall security risk seems low but should be confirmed with more context if available.",
