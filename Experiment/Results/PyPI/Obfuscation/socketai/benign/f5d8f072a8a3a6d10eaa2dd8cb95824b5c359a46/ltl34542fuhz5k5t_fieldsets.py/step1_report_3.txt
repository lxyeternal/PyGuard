  "purpose": "Defines a tuple containing a string and a dictionary related to blood glucose measurement data fields.",
  "sources": "None; the code is a static variable declaration with no input or external data reading.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, output, or untrusted data handling is present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or data processing occurs within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are detected; the code is straightforward variable assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code declares a typed tuple named 'glucose_fieldset_tuple' with a string and a dictionary. The dictionary contains a 'fields' key associated with a tuple of field names related to blood glucose measurements. There is no dynamic code execution, no input/output operations, no embedded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The code appears to serve as a static data structure definition typical for configuration or metadata.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, static data declaration without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It does not contain malware, malicious intent, or security risks.",
