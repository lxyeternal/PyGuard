  "purpose": "Define a tuple containing a descriptive string and a dictionary with form field names related to blood glucose measurement.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of a tuple with a string and a dictionary containing field names.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static data structure with no data flow.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or execution flow present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and well-formed.",
  "analysis": "The code declares a static tuple with a descriptive string and a dictionary of form fields. No dynamic code, input/output, network activity, or embedded secrets are present. The structure is typical for configuration or form schema. All reviews agree on its benign nature, with scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, and confidence=1, which are appropriate given the static, harmless nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, static data structure with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores are consistent with the analysis and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
  "model": "gpt-4.1-nano"
