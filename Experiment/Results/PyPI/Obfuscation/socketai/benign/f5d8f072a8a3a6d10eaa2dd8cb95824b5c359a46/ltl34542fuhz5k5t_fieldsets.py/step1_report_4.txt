  "purpose": "Define a tuple containing a string description and a dictionary of field names related to blood glucose measurement data.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string and dictionary within the tuple definition.",
  "sinks": "No data processing, input/output, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "No flow of untrusted data from sources to sinks, as the code only declares static data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no use of dynamic code execution, no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a tuple with a descriptive string and a dictionary containing a list of field names. There are no external inputs, no untrusted data sources, and no data processing or external interactions. It appears to be a static data structure definition intended for use in a larger application context.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, static declaration of a data structure with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It poses no security risks.",
