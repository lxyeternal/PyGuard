  "purpose": "Define a tuple containing a descriptive string and a dictionary with form field names related to blood glucose measurement.",
  "sources": "No explicit input or data reading sources are present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data output points are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks since the code is purely a data structure definition.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code simply declares a tuple with a string and a dictionary containing form field names. It does not perform any I/O, network communication, or dynamic code execution. There are no indications of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues. The structure appears to be part of a configuration or form definition for a health app or data collection form.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward data structure definition with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It appears safe and intended for normal use.",
