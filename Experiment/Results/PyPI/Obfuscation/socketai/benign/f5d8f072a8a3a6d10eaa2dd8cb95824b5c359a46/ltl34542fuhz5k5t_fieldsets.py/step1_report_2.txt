  "purpose": "Definition of a tuple containing a string identifier and a dictionary of related fields, likely for representing a blood glucose measurement form or data structure.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations; static assignment of a tuple with string and dictionary literals.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, outputs, or external system interactions present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only initializes a data structure.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a tuple with a descriptive string and a dictionary containing field names related to blood glucose measurement data. It is purely declarative and static, with no external data input or system interaction. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security issues detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward data structure definition with no malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as part of a data model or form configuration.",
