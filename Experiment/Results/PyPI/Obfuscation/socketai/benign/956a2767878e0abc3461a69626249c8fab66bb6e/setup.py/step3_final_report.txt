{
  "purpose": "Configure package metadata and dependencies for distribution, using obfuscated variable names for the URL and package info.",
  "sources": "Static variables assigned within the setup() call, including the URL in an obfuscated variable.",
  "sinks": "Potential during package installation if the URL is fetched and executed, but not evident in static code.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow; the URL could be used during install to fetch malicious code, but not in the static code itself.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, URL stored in a non-standard variable, no dynamic code or user input.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names, primarily containing static metadata. The URL stored in an obfuscated variable could be used maliciously during installation, but no code execution, network activity, or dynamic behavior is present. The obfuscation appears superficial, likely intended to hide the URL or package info but not malicious in itself. The overall structure is benign, but the presence of the URL warrants further inspection of its content before installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup configuration with high obfuscation and a suspicious URL. No active malicious behavior is detected, but caution is advised due to the obfuscated URL. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is high (0.8), and overall security risk is moderate (0.4). Further inspection of the URL is recommended before trusting or installing the package.",
