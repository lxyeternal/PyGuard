  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\nThe code snippet is:\n```python\nfrom ElM2D.ElM2D import ElM2D\n```\nThis is a straightforward import statement, importing the class `ElM2D` from the module `ElM2D` inside the package `ElM2D`.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues:**\n- The code itself does not contain any malicious code, obfuscated logic, or suspicious patterns.\n- No hardcoded secrets, network calls, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- The import path, while nested, appears to be a typical package structure.\n\n3. **Analysis of Each Report:**\nAll reports agree that this is a benign, standard import statement with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 to 1), which is appropriate given the simplicity of the code.\n\n4. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n- No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident. The reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n- No overestimations of risk or malware are present.\n- The reports are consistent and appropriately cautious, considering the limited context.\n\n5. **Scores and Justifications:**\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate. There is no indication of malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk Score:** All assign 0 or 0.1, which is reasonable. Since this is just an import statement with no malicious or risky behavior, a risk score of 0.0 or 0.1 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Potential for Higher Scores:**\n- If the package `ElM2D` or its contents were malicious, that would be outside the scope of this import statement alone. Without further context, there's no reason to assign higher scores.\n- The structure of the import path does not suggest obfuscation or malicious hiding.\n\n7. **Overall Assessment:**\nGiven the simplicity and benign nature of the code, I would assign the following scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\n**Final Justification:**\nThe code is a standard import statement with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risk. The high confidence levels in the reports are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis.",
