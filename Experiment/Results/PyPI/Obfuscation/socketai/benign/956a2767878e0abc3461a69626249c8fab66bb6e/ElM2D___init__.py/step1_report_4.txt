  "purpose": "Importing the ElM2D class from the ElM2D module within the ElM2D package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a third-party package/module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code does not process data or execute untrusted inputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis applicable; only a static import statement.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; the code is a straightforward import statement without additional logic or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains an import statement, importing the ElM2D class from a nested module. No input handling, data processing, or dynamic execution occurs. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior are evident. Since this is a simple import, it appears benign and standard in Python code. There is no evidence of malicious intent or anomalous patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any dangerous actions or data leakage.",
