  "purpose": "Import the ElM2D class from the ElM2D module within the ElM2D package.",
  "sources": "Import statement sourcing ElM2D.ElM2D.ElM2D",
  "sinks": "No sinks present in the code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow observed within this snippet as it only contains an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; the only notable aspect is the nested import, which is typical for package structures. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement importing the ElM2D class from a nested module path. There are no inputs, outputs, or executable logic in this fragment. Since the code only performs a module import, it does not present any direct security risk or malicious behavior. The structure is typical for a Python package and does not indicate obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a simple import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It does not contain any suspicious code or malicious activity.",
