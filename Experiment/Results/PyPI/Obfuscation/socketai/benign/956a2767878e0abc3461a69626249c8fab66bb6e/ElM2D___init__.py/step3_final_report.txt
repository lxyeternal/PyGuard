  "purpose": "Import the ElM2D class from the ElM2D package, likely for use in further computations or processing.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself, which reads the ElM2D class from the ElM2D module within the ElM2D package.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any operations that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "The import source (package/module) is loaded into the namespace; no data flows or external interactions occur.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward import statement with no obfuscation, dynamic code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement: 'from ElM2D.ElM2D import ElM2D'. All reports agree that this is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code. No additional context suggests any malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The high confidence scores reflect the straightforward nature of the code. No further analysis or adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard import statement with no malicious or suspicious activity detected. The scores are accurate and consistent with the code's nature. No security concerns are present based solely on this snippet.",
