{
  "purpose": "The code imports all symbols from four local modules, likely to expose their contents at a higher namespace level, typically in package initialization.",
  "sources": "Relative import statements from .core, .dataset, .process, and .utility modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions beyond imports.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows; the code only imports modules without executing further logic.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard ('*') imports, which can obscure symbol origins and potentially hide malicious code within the imported modules.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with wildcard imports from internal modules. No embedded malicious code, data handling, or network activity is present. The wildcard imports pose maintainability and namespace pollution concerns but are not inherently malicious. The security risk depends on the contents of the imported modules, which are not provided. Malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set to 0, reflecting no evidence of malicious activity. The security risk score is modest (around 0.1 to 0.3), acknowledging potential concealment but not indicating active threats. Confidence in this assessment is high (around 0.7), given the simplicity of the code and the lack of suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a module aggregator or initializer. The primary concern is the use of wildcard imports, which can hinder clarity and maintainability but do not constitute a security threat by themselves. The malware score is correctly zero; the overall security risk remains low. Scores are consistent with the analysis, and no immediate action is required beyond considering refactoring to explicit imports for better clarity.",
