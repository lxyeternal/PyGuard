{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from local modules core, dataset, process, and utility, likely to be used in a larger Python project for various functionalities.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.core, .dataset, .process, .utility)",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code only imports modules and does not process untrusted input or data",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code simply performs imports",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' from multiple modules can be considered a potential source of namespace pollution, but this is a common pattern in some projects; no suspicious or malicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code contains only import statements from local modules, which are not inherently malicious. There is no evidence of data input, output, or manipulation. The use of relative imports suggests a modular project structure. No obfuscation or suspicious activity is apparent. No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, performing module imports without any signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security vulnerabilities based on the provided snippet.",
