{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from local modules: core, dataset, process, and utility.",
  "sources": "Imports are the primary source points, potentially bringing in untrusted code if these modules contain malicious code.",
  "sinks": "The code itself does not have direct sinks; however, imported modules could introduce vulnerabilities if malicious.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow within this snippet; reliance on imported modules may lead to flow paths if those modules handle untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports ('*') can mask malicious code or hidden behaviors within imported modules, which is generally discouraged. No signs of obfuscation or malicious patterns are evident in this snippet itself.",
  "analysis": "This code only performs import statements from local modules using wildcard imports. This practice obscures which specific functions or classes are imported, potentially hiding malicious code within these modules. There are no other operations, no data handling, and no suspicious patterns directly visible in this fragment. The actual security posture depends heavily on the contents of the imported modules, which are not provided. The code’s simplicity and lack of active logic reduce immediate risk, but the use of 'import *' warrants caution because it can hide malicious code within the modules.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet by itself appears benign but is risky due to the use of wildcard imports. The security assessment ultimately depends on the contents of core, dataset, process, and utility modules. There are no explicit malicious behaviors or anomalies within this code fragment itself.",
