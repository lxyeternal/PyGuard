{
  "purpose": "The code imports all functions and classes from four modules: core, dataset, process, and utility, likely to assemble or initialize a larger application or library.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the modules core, dataset, process, and utility through wildcard imports.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Data and function references flow from the imported modules into the current namespace; no explicit source-to-sink data flow is observable here.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports ('*') can obscure the origin of functions and classes, making the code harder to analyze and potentially hiding malicious or unintended imports, but this alone is not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with wildcard imports from local modules. This pattern is common in package __init__.py files or module aggregation scripts, and does not inherently involve malicious intent. The absence of any runtime code, network activity, or data handling in this snippet limits the assessment. The use of wildcard imports is a potential concern for maintainability and clarity but not security per se. No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code performs module imports, likely as part of a larger, benign package setup. However, the use of wildcard imports is discouraged for clarity and security reasons, but it does not indicate malicious intent.",
