{
  "purpose": "The code imports all symbols from multiple modules, likely to set up a package or module namespace.",
  "sources": "Imports from .core, .dataset, .process, and .utility modules, which are internal to the package.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow or source-to-sink paths; only module imports.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' is generally discouraged due to potential namespace pollution and difficulty in analyzing imported symbols, but it is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with wildcard imports from internal modules. There are no signs of code injection, data leakage, or malicious logic. The use of relative imports suggests this is part of a larger package structure. Without additional context or code, no malicious behavior or security issues are evident. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs straightforward module imports without any indication of malicious intent or security risks. The use of 'import *' is a potential concern for maintainability but not security. Overall, the snippet appears benign.",
