  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a module aggregator or initializer. The primary concern is the use of wildcard imports, which can hinder clarity and maintainability but do not constitute a security threat by themselves. The malware score is correctly zero; the overall security risk remains low. Scores are consistent with the analysis, and no immediate action is required beyond considering refactoring to explicit imports for better clarity."
