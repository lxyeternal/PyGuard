  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\nAll five reports describe the code as simple import statements using wildcard imports from local modules (.core, .dataset, .process, .utility). They agree that:\n- The code is likely part of a package initialization or module aggregation.\n- No direct malicious activity, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets are evident.\n- The primary concern is the use of 'import *', which can obscure imported symbols and potentially hide malicious code within the modules themselves.\n- The confidence levels range from 0.6 to 1, with some noting that the actual security risk depends on the contents of the imported modules.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code only contains import statements; no other logic or data flows are present.\n- The use of wildcard imports ('*') is discouraged due to namespace pollution and potential concealment of malicious code.\n- Without inspecting the actual contents of the modules, we cannot definitively assess malicious activity.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:\n- The reports correctly identify that the use of 'import *' can be problematic but do not present evidence that malicious code is present.\n- No report claims or implies that the modules themselves are malicious; they only flag the potential risk associated with wildcard imports.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0.0, which aligns with the absence of evidence for malicious activity in this snippet.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of obfuscation.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.3. Given the potential for imported modules to contain malicious code, a cautious but reasonable score would be around 0.2, which most reports adopt.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- The primary concern is the potential for malicious code within the imported modules, not the import statements themselves.\n- Without access to the modules' contents, we cannot elevate the malware score.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 (no evidence of malicious code in the snippet)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 (moderate concern due to wildcard imports, which could hide malicious code if present)\n\n**Additional note:** If the contents of the modules are verified to be benign, the overall security posture remains low risk. However, if those modules are untrusted or unknown, the risk could be higher, but we lack that information.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is benign in isolation but uses a risky pattern ('import *') that warrants caution. The scores assigned by the reports are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary based on the provided information.",
