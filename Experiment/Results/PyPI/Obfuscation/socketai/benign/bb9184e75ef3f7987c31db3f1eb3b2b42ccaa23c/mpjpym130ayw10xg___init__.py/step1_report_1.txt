{
  "purpose": "The code imports all components from four modules: core, dataset, process, and utility, likely to build or configure a larger software system.",
  "sources": "Module import statements at the beginning of the file, importing from local packages.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data outputs are present in these import statements.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are identifiable within these import statements alone.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports (*) can obscure which symbols are imported, potentially hiding malicious or unintended code. No other suspicious activity or obfuscation is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements using wildcard imports from local modules. This pattern is common in package initialization or module aggregation files. No embedded or executed code, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are visible. The lack of further code limits insight, but based solely on this, no malicious activity can be inferred. Wildcard imports can sometimes be used to conceal unwanted functions but are not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to serve as a module aggregator or initializer, importing multiple submodules. There is no evidence of malicious intent or suspicious behavior in these import statements. The use of wildcard imports warrants caution but does not indicate malicious activity by itself.",
