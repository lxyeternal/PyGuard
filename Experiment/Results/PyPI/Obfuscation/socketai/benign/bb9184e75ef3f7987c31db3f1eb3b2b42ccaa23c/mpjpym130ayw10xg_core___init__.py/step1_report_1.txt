{
  "purpose": "Import specific functions or classes from local modules within the package.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules: .dataset, .step, and .embedding",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code only imports modules, no data processing or untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "No data flow paths; imports do not process data directly",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names that appear as random strings; no clear naming conventions, possibly obfuscated or auto-generated",
  "analysis": "The code imports three components from sibling modules within the package, with obfuscated-looking identifiers. No data is processed, no network or file I/O, and no suspicious patterns are present in this fragment. The use of seemingly random names could suggest code obfuscation or autogenerated code, but this alone does not indicate malicious behavior. There are no visible malicious actions or security risks in this minimal import statement.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists solely of import statements with obfuscated identifiers. No malicious activity or security vulnerabilities are apparent. The unusual naming could suggest obfuscation, but no malicious intent can be confirmed from this snippet alone.",
