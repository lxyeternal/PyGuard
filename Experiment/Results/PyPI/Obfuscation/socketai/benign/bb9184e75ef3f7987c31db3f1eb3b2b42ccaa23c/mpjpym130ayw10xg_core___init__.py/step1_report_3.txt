{
  "purpose": "The code imports modules from the current package, likely to organize functionality related to datasets, processing steps, and embeddings.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from internal module files: dataset, step, and embedding.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or external data output points are present; the code does not directly process untrusted data or perform actions such as network communication.",
  "flows": "There are no explicit source-to-sink flows within this snippet; the imports suggest internal data flow within the package structure.",
  "anomalies": "The imported identifiers appear as random strings, which is unusual and may indicate obfuscation or generated code. No actual execution, dynamic code, or suspicious patterns are present in this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code solely performs module imports from local files using non-descriptive, random-looking module names. There are no signs of malicious actions such as data exfiltration, network activity, or code injection. The naming pattern could be obfuscation or autogenerated, but without further code, no malicious intent can be confirmed.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple import statement with seemingly obfuscated or autogenerated module names. No malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious activity are evident from this snippet alone.",

  "obfuscated": 0.7,
