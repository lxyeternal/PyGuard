  "purpose": "Import modules or objects from local package submodules",
  "sources": "Imports from local package modules: .dataset, .step, .embedding",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; only module imports",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; only static imports",
  "anomalies": "Unusual import names that appear as random or obfuscated identifiers; no clear purpose for these specific object names",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific objects with seemingly random or obfuscated names from local modules. There is no evidence of dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or data transmission. The import names appear intentionally obfuscated, which could be for code protection or concealment. However, no malicious behavior such as data theft, network communication, or backdoors is evident from these lines. The code is minimal and lacks executable logic or external interactions.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard local module imports with obfuscated identifiers. There is no immediate sign of malicious intent or security risks. The unusual naming could suggest an attempt to conceal, but alone it does not indicate malicious activity.",
