{
  "purpose": "The code imports three modules from local package components, with obfuscated or nonsensical identifiers, likely autogenerated or intentionally obscured.",
  "sources": "Import statements from relative modules: .dataset, .step, .embedding",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows present; code does not process or output data, nor does it perform network or file operations.",
  "flows": "None; only static import statements without data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated module identifiers that are nonsensical or randomly generated, which may hinder maintainability and suggest obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules with obfuscated names. No data processing, network activity, or malicious actions are evident. The obfuscated identifiers raise suspicion but do not directly indicate malicious intent. The lack of dynamic behavior or external communication reduces risk. The obfuscation warrants further review of the imported modules, but this snippet alone does not demonstrate malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign in isolation, representing internal module imports with obfuscated names. No active malicious activity or security vulnerabilities are apparent. The obfuscation suggests caution but does not confirm malicious intent. Overall, the security risk is minimal, though further review of the full package is recommended.",
