  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions with obfuscation and potential security risks due to pickle usage and unvalidated URL downloads. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or active malware. The main concerns are the possibility of exploitation if cache files or URLs are malicious, but the code itself does not contain malicious intent."
