  "conclusion": "The code is likely safe, serving as data validation or testing routines, with no evidence of malicious activity. The main concern is the opaque 'sets' module, which should be reviewed separately. The malware score is low (0.2), obfuscation moderate (0.4), and overall security risk low (0.3). Continuous review of the 'sets' library is recommended before deployment in sensitive environments."
