  "conclusion": "The code is an obfuscated but benign embedding utility. There is no evidence of malware or malicious activity. The obfuscation is likely for proprietary or reverse-engineering resistance rather than malicious purposes. The supply chain security risk is minimal, and the malware score remains at 0."
