  "purpose": "Manage and process word embeddings with obfuscated class and method names, providing access and transformation functionalities.",
  "sources": "Input data includes embedding arrays, word keys, and optional external input for processing.",
  "sinks": "Internal data structures; no external network or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through internal methods, with key-based lookups and array manipulations, without external communication.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated naming conventions, deprecated use of .tostring(), warnings about key collisions, and internal warnings; no malicious payloads or external data leaks.",
  "analysis": "The code manages embeddings using numpy arrays, with obfuscated identifiers possibly for proprietary reasons. It performs internal lookups, transformations, and data handling without network activity or system modifications. The obfuscation and deprecated methods are suspicious but not malicious. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network communication, or sabotage, are present. The code appears to be a complex, obfuscated utility for embedding management, with no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is an obfuscated but benign embedding utility. There is no evidence of malware or malicious activity. The obfuscation is likely for proprietary or reverse-engineering resistance rather than malicious purposes. The supply chain security risk is minimal, and the malware score remains at 0.",
