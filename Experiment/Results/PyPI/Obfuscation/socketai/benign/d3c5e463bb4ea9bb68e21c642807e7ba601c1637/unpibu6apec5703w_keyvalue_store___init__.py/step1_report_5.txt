{
  "purpose": "Import specific functions or variables from local modules for use within the package.",
  "sources": "Imports from .keyvalue_store and .in_memory_ttl modules.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "Imported identifiers are not used or manipulated further in the provided code, so no data flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "Imported variable names from keyvalue_store are non-descriptive, suggesting possible obfuscation or placeholder names. No code execution or data handling is visible.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward relative imports of identifiers with non-descriptive names from two local modules. There are no functions, data processing, or network interactions present. The unusual variable names might indicate obfuscation, but without additional context, they could be legitimate. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks within these imports alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely consists of imports with non-descriptive names; there are no signs of malicious activity or security issues based on this fragment. Further context is needed to determine if these imports are used maliciously elsewhere.",
