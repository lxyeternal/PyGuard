  "purpose": "Import specific functions or variables from local modules related to key-value storage and in-memory TTL cache.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing obfuscated identifiers from local modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or untrusted data handling visible.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data transfer observed; imports are static.",
  "anomalies": "Imported identifiers are obfuscated names, which could be an attempt to hide malicious intent or simply code obfuscation; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules, with all imported names obfuscated. The use of obfuscated names can be benign (for code compression or obfuscation) or malicious (to hide malicious functions). No other suspicious behaviors, such as network calls, file operations, or data processing, are present. The code appears to be part of a larger codebase where these imports are used further downstream, but on their own, there's no evidence of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is limited to import statements with obfuscated identifiers, which could be a form of obfuscation or code hiding but does not inherently indicate malicious behavior. Without additional context or usage, it cannot be conclusively malicious. Overall risk is low based on this snippet.",
