{
  "purpose": "Import specific functions or variables from local modules related to key-value storage and in-memory TTL cache.",
  "sources": "Import statements accessing local modules: '.keyvalue_store' and '.in_memory_ttl'.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis needed beyond imports; code does not execute or process data.",
  "anomalies": "Imported names appear as obfuscated or nonsensical identifiers, which may suggest code obfuscation or deliberate concealment; no visible malicious code or behavior in these lines.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements importing two identifiers with seemingly obfuscated names from local modules. There is no additional code that processes data, interacts with external systems, or performs any suspicious activity. The unusual naming may indicate obfuscation, but without further code, no malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided lines, the code is limited to obfuscated import statements with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. Further context would be needed to confirm intent, but current analysis indicates low risk.",
  "confidence": 0.6,
  "obfuscated": 0.7,
