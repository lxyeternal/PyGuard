  "conclusion": "The code snippet is limited to import statements with obfuscated identifiers from local modules. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks based solely on this snippet. The high obfuscation score is justified but does not indicate malicious intent. The malware score remains at 0, and the overall security risk is low. Further review of the actual contents of the imported modules is recommended to confirm their safety, but based on this code alone, the security posture is benign."
