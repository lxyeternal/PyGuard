  "purpose": "Import specific functions or variables from local modules for use within the package.",
  "sources": "Import statements accessing modules within the same package",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present in the provided code",
  "flows": "Imports are static; no runtime data flow to external systems or untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "Imported identifiers appear as obfuscated or nonsensical strings, which could indicate obfuscation or malicious intent, but are not inherently malicious. No dynamic code execution or secret handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two import statements from local modules. The imported identifiers are long, seemingly random strings, which might suggest obfuscation or concealment. There is no evidence of malicious code such as network activity, system modifications, or data exfiltration. The imports are static, and no suspicious behavior is evident from this fragment alone. The overall structure is typical of a Python package, with obfuscated symbol names potentially used for internal purposes.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on these import statements, there is no clear evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The use of obfuscated names alone is not suspicious but warrants caution if these are part of a larger pattern. No malicious activities are detectable in this snippet.",
