  "purpose": "Analyze import statements with obfuscated identifiers from local modules for potential malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .keyvalue_store and .in_memory_ttl",
  "sinks": "None present; code only contains import statements without data flow or external interactions",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; only static import statements",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated variable names in import statements, which could be used to conceal malicious code",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements importing obfuscated identifiers from local modules. No code execution, data processing, network activity, or other suspicious behaviors are visible. The obfuscation of identifiers raises suspicion but is not inherently malicious. The malware score is appropriately set to 0, indicating no evidence of malicious intent. The obfuscation score is high (~0.8), reflecting suspicion due to naming, but this alone does not imply malicious activity. The security risk score is low (~0.2-0.3), consistent with the absence of active threats but acknowledging that obfuscation warrants caution. The reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code snippet and recommend further review of the imported modules to rule out malicious code hidden behind obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is limited to import statements with obfuscated identifiers from local modules. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks based solely on this snippet. The high obfuscation score is justified but does not indicate malicious intent. The malware score remains at 0, and the overall security risk is low. Further review of the actual contents of the imported modules is recommended to confirm their safety, but based on this code alone, the security posture is benign.",
