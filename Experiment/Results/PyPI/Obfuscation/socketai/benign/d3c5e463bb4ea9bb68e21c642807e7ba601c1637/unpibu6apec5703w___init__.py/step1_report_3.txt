  "purpose": "Import specific classes or functions from local modules for use within the package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .key_limiter, .token_bucket, and .sliding_window_counter.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data leaks; just import statements.",
  "flows": "Imported classes/functions are used later in the codebase; no direct data flow shown here.",
  "anomalies": "Use of non-descriptive, seemingly random class/function names, which could indicate obfuscation or malicious intent, but could also be due to code obfuscation or non-standard naming conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports three elements from local modules using obfuscated names. The naming pattern appears intentionally obscure, which can be a red flag but can also be part of code obfuscation or a naming convention. There are no apparent malicious behaviors such as network calls, data leaks, or execution of dynamic code within these lines. Without additional context, these imports themselves do not indicate malicious intent but warrant caution due to naming obscurity. No external data or inputs are involved; these are static import statements.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists solely of import statements with obfuscated names. No direct malicious behavior or security risks are evident from these lines alone. However, the obfuscation warrants further review of the imported modules to ensure they are safe and not maliciously crafted.",
