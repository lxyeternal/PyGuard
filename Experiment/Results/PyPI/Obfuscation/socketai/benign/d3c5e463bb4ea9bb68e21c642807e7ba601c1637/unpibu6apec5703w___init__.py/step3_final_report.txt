  "purpose": "Import obfuscated internal modules/classes, possibly for functionality encapsulation or concealment.",
  "sources": "Internal module files: key_limiter, token_bucket, sliding_window_counter",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; only static imports present.",
  "flows": "Import statements load modules/classes into namespace; no data flow or execution beyond import.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated module/class names, which may indicate concealment but are not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of three import statements from internal modules with obfuscated names. No dynamic code, network activity, or data handling is visible. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. The malware score is appropriately zero, and security risk is low, around 0.2, given the lack of evidence of malicious behavior. The confidence in benign assessment is high (around 0.7), but caution due to obfuscation is warranted. The scores across reports are consistent and justified based on the limited context.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with obfuscated identifiers raising suspicion but no evidence of malicious activity. Further inspection of the imported modules is recommended to rule out malicious content. Current scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0.7, risk=0.2) are appropriate and justified.",
