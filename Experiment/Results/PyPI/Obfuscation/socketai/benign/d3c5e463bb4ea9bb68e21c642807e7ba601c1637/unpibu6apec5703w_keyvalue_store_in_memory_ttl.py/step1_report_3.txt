  "purpose": "A cache-like data structure with expiration based on TTL (time-to-live), providing get and set methods with automatic cleanup of expired entries.",
  "sources": "Reads current time via self._time() in oalnxcIVPDUlFHrIYUlCLbdFosDwghgn(), during set() for expiration calculation, and during cleanup process.",
  "sinks": "Potentially exposes stored values via get() method; no direct untrusted input sink present beyond data retrieval.",
  "flows": "Data is set into the store with expiration time, retrieved via get(). Expired entries are automatically cleaned up during access.",
  "anomalies": "Function and variable names are obfuscated, which can be suspicious; no hardcoded secrets, malicious logic, or obfuscation techniques detected. No network activity or file operations present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a TTL cache with expiration management. Uses ordered dictionary for efficient eviction. Obfuscation in identifiers might suggest hiding intent, but functionally it appears as a standard cache. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The overall design is typical for cache mechanisms. The obfuscation alone is not enough to classify as malicious, but warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard TTL cache implementation with obfuscated identifiers. No malicious or suspicious behaviors identified. Obfuscation might be for code concealment but not inherently malicious.",
