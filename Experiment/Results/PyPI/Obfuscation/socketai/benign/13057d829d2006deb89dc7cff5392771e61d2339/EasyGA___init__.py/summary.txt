  "security_risk": 0.2,

  "conclusion": "The import statements alone do not demonstrate malicious behavior. The high obfuscation score reflects suspicion based on naming but does not imply malware. The malware score remains at 0, and the overall security risk is low. These findings suggest caution and further review of the full package and usage context rather than immediate concern."
