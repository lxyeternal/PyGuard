  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated genetic algorithm implementation with no concrete evidence of malicious activity. The high obfuscation score reflects intentional concealment, but the absence of external malicious actions suggests a low malware risk. The moderate security risk score accounts for the potential of obfuscation to hide malicious logic, warranting cautious handling. Overall, the code appears benign but warrants further review if used in untrusted environments."
