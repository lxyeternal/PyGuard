  "conclusion": "Most reports correctly identify benign code with low security risks. Report 4's signs of obfuscation and suspicious patterns justify its higher scores. Overall, the scoring is consistent with the analysis, and no significant revisions are necessary. For further assurance, review of actual code snippets, especially in suspicious cases, is recommended."
