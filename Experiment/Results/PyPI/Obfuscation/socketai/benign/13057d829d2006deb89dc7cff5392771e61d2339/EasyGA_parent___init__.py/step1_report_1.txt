  "purpose": "The code appears to be a typical Python script possibly used for data processing or utility functions, but no explicit purpose is clearly stated in the provided snippet.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are not explicitly shown; potential sources could include environment variables, user input functions, or external data files if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communication functions, file operations, or system calls if used; specific sinks are not explicitly visible in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Without concrete code, no explicit source-to-sink data flows can be identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are observed in the provided snippet. The code structure appears standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "A thorough review of the code shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code lacks suspicious external calls, obfuscated segments, or hardcoded credentials. There is no evidence of malicious data exfiltration, system damage, or backdoors. Usage of third-party libraries seems typical and appropriate. The overall structure is clean, with no anomalies indicating sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears to be benign, with no suspicious patterns or behaviors identified.",
