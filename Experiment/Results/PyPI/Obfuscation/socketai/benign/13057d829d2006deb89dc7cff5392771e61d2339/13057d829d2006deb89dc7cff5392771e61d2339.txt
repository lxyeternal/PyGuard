The high obfuscation levels warrant caution and further review of dependencies, but the overall security risk is minimal. Malware activity is not present, and the code does not perform any harmful operations."

The malware score remains at 0, and the overall security risk is low. These findings suggest caution and further review of the full package and usage context rather than immediate concern."

      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate but heavily obfuscated genetic algorithm framework. While no active malicious activity is detected, the obfuscation and reliance on external, possibly untrusted functions pose a moderate security concern. Further review of imported modules and runtime functions is recommended before deployment in sensitive environments."

      "confidence": 0.85,
      "conclusion": "Most reports correctly identify benign code with low security risks. Report 4's signs of obfuscation and suspicious patterns justify its higher scores. Overall, the scoring is consistent with the analysis, and no significant revisions are necessary. For further assurance, review of actual code snippets, especially in suspicious cases, is recommended."

      "obfuscated": 0.9,
      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a heavily obfuscated implementation of genetic algorithm selection routines. While obfuscation raises suspicion, there is no direct evidence of malicious activity such as network communication, data theft, or system compromise. The low malware scores are justified, and the high obfuscation scores reflect the code's obscured nature. Overall, the supply chain risk is moderate, primarily due to obfuscation, but the code itself does not exhibit active malicious behavior."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The dependency appears benign based on the available reviews, with moderate suspicion only in report 4 due to obfuscation and dynamic constructs. Scores are appropriate and consistent with the evidence. Further code analysis could refine these scores, but current assessments are reasonable."

      "conclusion": "The code appears benign in its visible form but employs obfuscated decorators from an external source, which could execute malicious code during import or decoration. Further investigation into the decorator implementations is recommended to confirm their behavior. The risk remains moderate, and caution should be exercised before deploying or trusting this code."

      "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated genetic algorithm implementation with no concrete evidence of malicious activity. The high obfuscation score reflects intentional concealment, but the absence of external malicious actions suggests a low malware risk. The moderate security risk score accounts for the potential of obfuscation to hide malicious logic, warranting cautious handling. Overall, the code appears benign but warrants further review if used in untrusted environments."
