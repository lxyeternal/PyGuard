  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a certain function, but without the actual code, it is unclear. It may relate to data processing or system interaction.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, system inputs, or data files (exact sources are unspecified without code).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks involve network communication, file writes, or system commands (specifics are unspecified).",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks possibly through variable assignments or function calls, but details are unavailable without the code.",
  "anomalies": "No specific anomalies can be identified without seeing the code. No hardcoded secrets or unusual patterns are evident from the description.",
  "analysis": "Due to lack of code content, a detailed step-by-step analysis cannot be performed. In a typical review, I would check for hardcoded credentials, suspicious network calls, unsafe data handling, and obfuscated code. As no code is provided, only general security considerations apply.",
  "conclusion": "There is insufficient information to determine malicious behavior or security risks. Based on the absence of code, no malicious patterns or anomalies can be confirmed. The overall security assessment cannot be reliably performed.",
