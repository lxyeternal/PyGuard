{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script, possibly for data processing or utility functions, with no immediately obvious malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from variables, function arguments, or standard input; no external or untrusted sources are explicitly evident.",
  "sinks": "Data is outputted to console, files, or returned from functions; no insecure or suspicious sinks are identified.",
  "flows": "Inputs flow through functions and are outputted or processed further; no untrusted data flows leading to security concerns are apparent.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are detected. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with standard function definitions, variable usage, and control flow. No network connections, data exfiltration mechanisms, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code does not appear to perform any actions that could harm or compromise system security. All third-party libraries used are common and do not by themselves indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is benign, with no evidence of malware or security vulnerabilities.",
