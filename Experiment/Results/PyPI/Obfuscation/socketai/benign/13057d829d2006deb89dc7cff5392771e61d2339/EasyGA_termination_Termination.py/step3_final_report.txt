{
  "purpose": "The code imports three obfuscated decorators from 'EasyGA.decorators' and applies them to a trivial function that returns True, likely as a placeholder or for side effects during import or decoration.",
  "sources": "Import statements for decorators from 'EasyGA.decorators'.",
  "sinks": "No direct data leaks or external outputs; the function returns a static value.",
  "flows": "Decorators are applied during function definition, potentially executing code at import or decoration time if the decorators contain side effects.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated decorator names, which may conceal malicious behavior; the code itself is trivial and does not process data.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, with obfuscated decorators that could execute arbitrary code during import or decoration. No malicious actions are visible in the snippet, but the obfuscation and external dependency raise suspicion. The function's simplicity suggests no direct malicious intent, but the decorators' behavior is unknown. The higher malware score (0.4) in the most cautious report is justified due to potential hidden malicious code within the decorators. The overall security risk is moderate, primarily due to obfuscation and external dependencies that could conceal malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign in its visible form but employs obfuscated decorators from an external source, which could execute malicious code during import or decoration. Further investigation into the decorator implementations is recommended to confirm their behavior. The risk remains moderate, and caution should be exercised before deploying or trusting this code.",
