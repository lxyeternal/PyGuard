  "purpose": "Standard setup script for the 'EasyGA' Python package, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; static variables used for package configuration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks detected; no network or system modification activities.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md -> passing static data to setuptools.setup()",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated variable names; no malicious code or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with obfuscated variable names but no malicious behavior, network activity, or vulnerabilities. The obfuscation appears stylistic or for code protection, not malicious intent. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or data exfiltration observed. The static analysis confirms benign functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign package setup script with obfuscated variable names. No evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. The obfuscation does not imply malicious intent, and the security risk is minimal.",
