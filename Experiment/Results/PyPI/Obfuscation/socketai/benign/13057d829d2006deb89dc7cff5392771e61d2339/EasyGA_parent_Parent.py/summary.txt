  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a heavily obfuscated implementation of genetic algorithm selection routines. While obfuscation raises suspicion, there is no direct evidence of malicious activity such as network communication, data theft, or system compromise. The low malware scores are justified, and the high obfuscation scores reflect the code's obscured nature. Overall, the supply chain risk is moderate, primarily due to obfuscation, but the code itself does not exhibit active malicious behavior."
