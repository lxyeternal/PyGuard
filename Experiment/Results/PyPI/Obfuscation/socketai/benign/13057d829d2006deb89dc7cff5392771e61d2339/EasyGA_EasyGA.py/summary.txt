  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate genetic algorithm framework with significant obfuscation but no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. The high obfuscation levels warrant caution and further review of dependencies, but the overall security risk is minimal. Malware activity is not present, and the code does not perform any harmful operations."
