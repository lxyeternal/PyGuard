{
  "purpose": "Defines a class related to structuring external data from high-energy physics experiments, likely for data management or analysis.",
  "sources": "Class definition, potential data input points for external experiment data, possibly via method parameters or external data files.",
  "sinks": "Potential data output or processing functions, possibly writing data or sending it over a network (not explicitly shown).",
  "flows": "Data likely flows from external sources into class attributes or methods, but no explicit source-to-sink path is evident in the fragment provided.",
  "anomalies": "Lack of actual code implementation details; no suspicious strings, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code constructs are visible. The class name and comment seem benign but are generic.",
  "analysis": "The provided snippet only contains a class declaration with a descriptive comment. There are no methods, data handling, network operations, or other executable code. Without further implementation details, it is not possible to identify malicious behavior. The structure appears standard for a scientific data class, and no anomalies or malicious indicators are evident in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this class declaration and comment, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a standard scientific data structuring class without any suspicious elements.",
