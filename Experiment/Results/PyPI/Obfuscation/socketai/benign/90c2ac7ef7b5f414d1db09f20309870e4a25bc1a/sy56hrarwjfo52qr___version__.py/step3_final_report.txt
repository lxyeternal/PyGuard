{
  "purpose": "A minimal class declaration with obfuscated names, likely intended for data structuring in physics experiments, with no active logic or data flow.",
  "sources": "Class declaration itself; no input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external interactions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code contains only a class header.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names with no implementation, which is suspicious but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a class declaration with obfuscated identifiers and no methods or data processing. All reports correctly identify the obfuscation and lack of active code. The scores for malware are appropriately zero, reflecting no evidence of malicious activity. The high obfuscation scores are justified due to nonsensical naming, but without concrete malicious behavior, the overall security risk remains low. The confidence scores are moderate, acknowledging the suspicion but also the absence of active threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated class definition with no evidence of malicious intent. The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not indicate malicious behavior. The current scores are consistent with the evidence; no adjustments are necessary.",
