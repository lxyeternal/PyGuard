{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some data processing or utility functions, but without specific context or comments, it is unclear.",
  "sources": "Input data is likely read from the user via input() functions or external files (not explicitly shown). No explicit source code provided, so this is inferred.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, file writes, network communication, or eval/exec functions if present. No such explicit sinks identified due to lack of code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions, possibly leading to outputs or external calls. Specific flow paths cannot be determined without code.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports are detected. The code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The analysis is limited due to the absence of actual code. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious constructs are evident from the provided snippet. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard; no malicious behavior identified. Lack of code prevents detailed source-to-sink flow mapping.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, but a more detailed review requires actual code content.",
