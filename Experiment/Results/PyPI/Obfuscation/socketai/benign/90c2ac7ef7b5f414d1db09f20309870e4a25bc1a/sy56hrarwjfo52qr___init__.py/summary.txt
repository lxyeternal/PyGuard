  "conclusion": "Based on the available information, the dependency shows no confirmed malicious activity or obfuscation. The risk scores are appropriately low, with a slight caution for report 2 due to potential dynamic features. The overall security posture appears safe, and scores are justified given the absence of concrete code evidence."
