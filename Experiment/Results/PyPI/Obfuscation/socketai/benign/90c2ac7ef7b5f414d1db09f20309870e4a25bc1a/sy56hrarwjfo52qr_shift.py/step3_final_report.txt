{
  "purpose": "Defines a helper class for describing systematic shifts, managing attributes such as source, direction, and type, with methods for copying, splitting, and joining shift identifiers.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters for shift description, including source, direction, and type; no external data or network activity.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or untrusted data flows detected.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into class attributes; no external data flow or network communication.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of placeholder or obfuscated strings (e.g., 'CUuKxZEDeggtOyFeqbQozcVkluaUfWLf') that appear nonsensical or obfuscated; actual implementation code is missing or incomplete.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class attribute definitions and documentation. No executable code or malicious behavior is evident. The obfuscated strings suggest placeholders or incomplete code, but do not indicate malicious intent. The class manages shift parameters and provides utility methods for handling shift identifiers. No external data leaks, network activity, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility class for managing systematic shifts, with no active malicious behavior or security issues. The presence of obfuscated placeholder strings warrants attention but does not constitute malicious activity. Overall, the code is safe, with minimal security risk.",
