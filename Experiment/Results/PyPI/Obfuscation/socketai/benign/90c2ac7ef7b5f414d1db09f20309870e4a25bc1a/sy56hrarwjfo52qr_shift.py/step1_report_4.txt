{
  "purpose": "Defines a helper class for describing systematic shifts in data analysis, including source, direction, type, and various attributes for handling shifts systematically.",
  "sources": "Input data for shift parameters such as shift name, source, direction, and type, typically passed during class instantiation.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or untrusted data flows observed; the code primarily defines class attributes and methods.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arguments to class attributes, and from method calls like split_name and join_name to generate or interpret shift identifiers.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual behavior detected. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or hidden mechanisms. The code is straightforward in defining a descriptive class.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for handling systematic shifts with attributes for source, direction, and type, with constants for standard shift categories. It includes methods for copying instances and splitting/joining shift names, which are standard for managing shift descriptors. No external data sources or sinks are directly involved, and no malicious behavior or anomalies are evident. The class seems to serve as a utility for data analysis workflows.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign utility class for describing systematic shifts with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It provides structured management of shift parameters without external data manipulation or insecure operations.",
