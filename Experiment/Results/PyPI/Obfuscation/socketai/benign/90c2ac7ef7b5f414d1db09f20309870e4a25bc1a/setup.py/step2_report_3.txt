  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reported issues, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code reads files (`README.md`, `requirements.txt`, `__version__.py`) and then executes the content of `__version__.py` via `exec()`.\n- Variable names are obfuscated, which can be an attempt to hide intent or simply for code complexity.\n- The core concern is the use of `exec()` on an external file, which can execute malicious code if the file is compromised or maliciously altered.\n- No evidence of network activity, data exfiltration, or other malicious behaviors is observed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose:** Setup script reading metadata, requirements, version info.\n- **Main concern:** `exec()` on `__version__.py`.\n- **Scores:** malware 0.2, securityRisk 0.4, obfuscated 0.5, confidence 0.6.\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- The `exec()` usage is risky but common in some setup scripts.\n- The obfuscation and `exec()` raise suspicion but do not confirm malicious intent.\n- Malware score of 0.2 seems somewhat high given no evidence of malicious activity; it should be lower unless there's reason to suspect malicious content in `__version__.py`.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\n- Reduce malware score to 0.1–0.2, unless the `__version__.py` is untrusted or known to be compromised.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar setup script.\n- **Main concern:** `exec()` on `__version__.py`.\n- **Scores:** malware 0, securityRisk 0.3, obfuscated 0.6, confidence 0.7.\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- No malware indicated; the score is zero, which aligns with the lack of malicious activity.\n- The security risk is moderate due to `exec()`.\n- Obfuscation is moderate.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- This report is consistent; no malware suspicion.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose:** Setup configuration.\n- **Main concern:** `exec()` on `__version__.py`.\n- **Scores:** malware 0, securityRisk 0.2, obfuscated 0.3, confidence 0.8.\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- Similar to previous; no malware detected.\n- The low malware score is appropriate.\n- The high confidence is justified given the pattern.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose:** Setup script.\n- **Main concern:** `exec()` on `__version__.py`.\n- **Scores:** malware 0, securityRisk 0.3, obfuscated 0.3, confidence 0.7.\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- Consistent with previous; no malware.\n- The security risk score reflects the `exec()` concern adequately.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose:** Setup with `exec()` on `__version__.py`.\n- **Scores:** malware 0, securityRisk 0.6, obfuscated 0.8, confidence 0.7.\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- The malware score is 0, which is appropriate.\n- The security risk is higher (0.6), justified by the risky `exec()`.\n- Obfuscation is high, which warrants caution.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Recommendations**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign low malware risk (mostly 0 or 0.2), as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated variables:** Slightly high in some reports (up to 0.8), but given the code pattern, this is acceptable.\n- **Security risk:** Elevated due to the use of `exec()` on external files. Scores range from 0.2 to 0.6, with the highest in report 5.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0.1** — The code itself does not show malicious behavior, only risky code execution.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0.4** — Variable names are obfuscated but not excessively so.\n- **Risk score:** **0.4** — The primary concern is the use of `exec()`, which can be exploited if the version file is compromised.\n\n**Final note:** The main security concern is the `exec()` on external files, which should be replaced with safer alternatives, such as static imports or parsing version info without executing code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Estimated Value | Justification                                                                                     |\n|-----------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | **0.1**           | No malicious activity detected; `exec()` is risky but not inherently malicious.               |\n| Obfuscated      | **0.4**           | Variable names are obfuscated but within acceptable limits for such scripts.                 |\n| Security Risk   | **0.4**           | Use of `exec()` introduces a security risk if the version file is compromised or malicious.  |\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard setup script with moderate security concerns due to dynamic code execution. No signs of malware are present, but the use of `exec()` should be addressed for safer practices.",
