  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, reading metadata, requirements, and version info, then calling setup().",
  "sources": "Reading README.md, requirements.txt, and executing '__version__.py' via exec().",
  "sinks": "The exec() call on '__version__.py' can execute arbitrary code if the file is compromised.",
  "flows": "Reading files -> exec() on version file -> setup() call.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on a local file, obfuscated variable names, no network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names. The primary security concern is the use of exec() to execute code from '__version__.py', which could be malicious if the file is tampered with. No active malicious behavior is evident. The obfuscation may hide intent but is not necessarily malicious. The scores assigned in reports are generally consistent; malware scores are low (0-0.2), reflecting no direct evidence of malicious code, while security risk scores (0.2-0.6) are justified due to the unsafe exec pattern. The pattern of executing external code without validation is a known security risk, though not inherently malicious. It is advisable to replace exec() with safer alternatives like static imports or parsing version info without executing code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with a significant security concern due to the use of exec() on a local version file. While no malicious activity is currently detected, the pattern itself poses a risk if the version file is compromised. The obfuscation does not imply malicious intent but warrants caution. The overall security risk is moderate, and the malware likelihood remains low. It is recommended to replace exec() with safer methods to mitigate potential exploitation.",
