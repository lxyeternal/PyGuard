  "purpose": "Setup configuration script for packaging a Python project, including reading metadata, dependencies, and version info.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md, requirements.txt, and version info from '__version__.py'.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is used in a dangerous manner. The code only reads files and executes a version file.",
  "flows": "Reads files to gather metadata, then passes data into setup() for packaging.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'exec' to execute contents of '__version__.py' without validation; potential security concern if the file is tampered. Variable names are obfuscated, but no malicious behavior detected. The 'exec' could be exploited if the version file is maliciously modified.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup tasks: reading the project README, requirements, and version info. The use of 'exec' on the version file is a common pattern but can be risky if the file's content is compromised. No other suspicious code, network activity, or malicious behavior observed. The obfuscated variable names do not indicate malicious intent but reduce code clarity. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a typical setup script with obfuscated variable names and a potentially risky 'exec' statement for version extraction. There are no direct signs of malicious behavior or malware, but the use of 'exec' warrants caution if the version file is not controlled securely.",
