  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, reading metadata, requirements, and version info.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md, requirements.txt, and version data from '__version__.py'.",
  "sinks": "exec() call executing code from '__version__.py', potential for executing malicious code.",
  "flows": "Reading '__version__.py' content and executing it via exec(), then passing data to setup().",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on external file content; no validation or sanitization shown. Variable and file names are obfuscated, which may conceal malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script reads metadata and requirements from files. The critical concern is the use of exec() to run code from '__version__.py', which could execute malicious code if the file is compromised or maliciously altered. The rest of the script appears to set up package metadata. Obfuscated variable names and the execution of external code are suspicious. No other malicious behavior, such as network activity or data exfiltration, is present.",
  "conclusion": "The main security concern is the use of exec() to run code from a local file, which could be malicious if that file is tampered with. Otherwise, the script performs standard setup tasks. The obfuscation and exec() usage warrant caution.",
