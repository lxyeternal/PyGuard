  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated configuration management class with no evidence of malicious behavior. The high obfuscation score (0.8) is justified, but the malware score remains at 0 due to lack of malicious indicators. The security risk score is low (0.2), reflecting minimal threat beyond obfuscation. Overall, the code appears legitimate but warrants ongoing review due to obfuscation."
