  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Data input functions, environment variables, network activity, dynamic execution points such as eval/exec, file handling, environment variable access.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, system commands, potential data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Input sources (user input, environment variables) to sinks (network, file, system commands) via dynamic execution or data handling functions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval/exec, obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, ambiguous purpose, inconsistent code structure.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits typical benign patterns with standard input/output handling and no suspicious activity, aligning with a malware score of 0 and low obfuscation. Suspicious patterns such as eval, network activity, and obfuscation are present in some reports, leading to moderate scores (malware ~0.4, obfuscated ~0.5). The overall security risk correlates with these patterns, averaging around 0.4-0.5. The absence of code in some reports is correctly scored as zero. The scores are consistent with the described behaviors, with minor adjustments suggested for reports indicating suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with low security risk; some reports show signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, warranting moderate concern. Scores are generally justified and consistent with the analysis, with a recommended malware score of approximately 0.4 and obfuscation around 0.5 to reflect moderate suspicion.",
