  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with low security risk; some reports show signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, warranting moderate concern. Scores are generally justified and consistent with the analysis, with a recommended malware score of approximately 0.4 and obfuscation around 0.5 to reflect moderate suspicion."
