{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'wallbreaker' Python package, including reading the README file and defining package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file via open('README.md', 'r')",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "Read README content → Pass to setup() as long_description",
  "anomalies": "Use of non-descriptive, obfuscated variable names; the package data includes a JavaScript file 'agent.js', which could potentially contain malicious code, but its content is not provided here.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs standard setup operations: reading a README file and invoking setuptools.setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and package data. The use of heavily obfuscated variable names is suspicious, but no malicious code or behavior (such as network connections, credential handling, or data leaks) is evident within this snippet. The inclusion of 'agent.js' in package data warrants further review, but without its content, no malicious activity can be confirmed.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard setup configuration with obfuscated variable names, which could be a red flag but does not, by itself, indicate malicious intent. No malware or malicious behaviors are detected in this code. However, further inspection of 'agent.js' is recommended for complete security assessment.",
