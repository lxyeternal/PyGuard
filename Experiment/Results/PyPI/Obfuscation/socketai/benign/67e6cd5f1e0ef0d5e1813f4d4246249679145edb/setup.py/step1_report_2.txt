  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'wallbreaker' Python package, including reading the README.md file and defining package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file from disk.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data flows identified; no network or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Read 'README.md' file -> setup configuration, no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names (e.g., FctVScPflwCczUgihtOHbTIwFAtKdzFO, BUkJrErTIGjOMqfjcTHTjlTvFzCqGyNI) which seem obfuscated or randomly generated, but no malicious intent detected.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a local README.md file and uses setuptools to configure package installation parameters. All parameters and dependencies are standard, and no code executes dynamically or interacts with external systems beyond the package metadata. The obfuscated variable names do not correspond to malicious code or suspicious behavior. No network calls, backdoors, or malicious payloads are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script for a Python package with obfuscated variable names. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected based on the provided code.",
