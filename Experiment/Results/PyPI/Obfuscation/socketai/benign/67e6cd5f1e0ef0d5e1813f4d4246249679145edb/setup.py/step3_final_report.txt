  "purpose": "Standard setup.py script configuring package metadata, dependencies, and package data for the 'wallbreaker' Python package.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; defines package info and dependencies; includes 'agent.js' in package data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows are present in this code.",
  "flows": "N/A - no dynamic data flow or untrusted data handling detected.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated variable names; inclusion of 'agent.js' in package data without inspection; no code execution or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with obfuscated variable names, which could be an attempt to hide intent but does not contain malicious code. No suspicious behaviors such as code injection, network calls, or credential handling are present. The inclusion of 'agent.js' warrants further review, but its content is unknown. The malware score is 0, as no malicious activity is evident. The obfuscation score is high (~0.8), justified by variable naming. The security risk score is low (~0.2), consistent with benign setup code. The high obfuscation warrants caution, but no direct malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script appears benign, with obfuscated variable names that may be superficial. No malicious activity or security vulnerabilities are evident in the provided code. The main concern is the external 'agent.js' file, which should be reviewed separately. Overall, the package is considered safe based on this analysis.",
