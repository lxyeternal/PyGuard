{
  "purpose": "Set up and configure a Python package named 'wallbreaker' with associated metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading from 'README.md' file, package setup parameters, including package data.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; no untrusted data outputs or external data transmissions are evident.",
  "flows": "Input from README.md flows into the setup description; no data flows to untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names and unusual variable assignments, such as 'FctVScPflwCczUgihtOHbTIwFAtKdzFO' and 'BUkJrErTIGjOMqfjcTHTjlTvFzCqGyNI', which appear to be intentionally obfuscated or random strings. No actual malicious code or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup using setuptools, reading a README file and configuring package metadata. All variable names are intentionally obfuscated but do not influence functionality. No network activity, credential handling, or malicious logic is present. The obfuscation may be to hinder casual review but does not necessarily indicate malicious intent. The code lacks any suspicious code execution, data exfiltration, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard Python package setup script with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within this code. The obfuscation appears to be superficial and does not impact the benign nature of the code.",
