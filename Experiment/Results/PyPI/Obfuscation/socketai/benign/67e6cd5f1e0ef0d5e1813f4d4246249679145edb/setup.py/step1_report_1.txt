{
  "purpose": "This code defines setup configuration for a Python package called 'wallbreaker', including reading a README file and specifying package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads 'README.md' from the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present in this code; it primarily sets up package metadata.",
  "flows": "The flow is from reading the README file to passing its content into the setup() function as long_description.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names (e.g., FctVScPflwCczUgihtOHbTIwFAtKdzFO, BUkJrErTIGjOMqfjcTHTjlTvFzCqGyNI, TxqtdunglvdMjFzzAsmBrcSxmsvXlArG) are used instead of conventional naming. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The script loads package configuration data, including reading a Markdown file for the description. The variable names are highly obfuscated or randomly generated, which could be an attempt to hide intent or simply a code obfuscation technique. No code injection, network calls, or other malicious behaviors are present. Dependencies are standard packages ('frida' and 'click') and are not suspicious. No backdoors, hidden behaviors, or suspicious data flows are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with obfuscated variable names. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided content.",
