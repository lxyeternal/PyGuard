  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'wallbreaker' intended for reverse engineering and debugging Android applications using Frida.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file to obtain long description content.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are identified; no untrusted data flows to sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Reads from 'README.md' and assigns it to a variable; no data flows to other parts or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names (e.g., FctVScPflwCczUgihtOHbTIwFAtKdzFO) are used instead of meaningful identifiers, which could suggest obfuscation or an attempt to obscure intent. The code does not contain any obvious malicious logic, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. No hardcoded credentials or dangerous operations are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script using setuptools to configure a Python package. It reads a README file for long description content and sets package metadata, dependencies, and package data. Variable names are obfuscated, which is uncommon for typical setup scripts and may indicate an attempt to hide code intent or obfuscation. No malicious operations, network activity, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The script solely prepares package installation parameters. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup configuration for a Python package with obfuscated variable names. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks based on its content. The obfuscation may be benign or intended to evade simple code inspection, but no malicious intent is detected.",
