      "obfuscated": 0.8,
      "confidence": 0.85,
      "conclusion": "The setup script appears benign, with obfuscated variable names that may be superficial. No malicious activity or security vulnerabilities are evident in the provided code. The main concern is the external 'agent.js' file, which should be reviewed separately. Overall, the package is considered safe based on this analysis."

      "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with low security risk; some reports show signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, warranting moderate concern. Scores are generally justified and consistent with the analysis, with a recommended malware score of approximately 0.4 and obfuscation around 0.5 to reflect moderate suspicion."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign device and process management utility for reverse engineering or debugging, with obfuscation that warrants cautious review but no evidence of malicious intent. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. The security risk is low, and the malware score should remain at 0. The obfuscation score is moderate to high due to variable naming, around 0.7. The overall risk score is low (~0.2)."

      "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated string manipulation with no evidence of malware or malicious intent. While obfuscation warrants caution, there are no active threats or malicious behaviors detected. The overall security risk is low, but monitoring is advised if part of a larger system."

The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No significant revisions are necessary; continued monitoring is recommended if further code is available."

The current implementation does not contain explicit malware but warrants caution due to obfuscation and external dependencies."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits characteristics typical of potentially malicious or heavily obfuscated code, with dynamic code generation, RPC reliance, and obfuscated naming. While no explicit malicious payload is directly visible, these patterns pose a significant security concern and warrant further investigation, especially into the trustworthiness of RPC endpoints and data validation mechanisms."
