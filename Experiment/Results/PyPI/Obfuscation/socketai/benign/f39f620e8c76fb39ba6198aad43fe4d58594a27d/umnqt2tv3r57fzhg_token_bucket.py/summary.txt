  "conclusion": "The code is a standard token bucket rate limiter with obfuscated naming. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation is notable but not malicious. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, and the overall security assessment should remain low risk."
