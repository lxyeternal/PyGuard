  "purpose": "Implements a token bucket rate limiter for controlling resource access or request rate.",
  "sources": "Reads from time.monotonic(), class constructor parameters, and method calls that access internal state.",
  "sinks": "Updates internal state variables such as self.value and self.last_update; no external data output or network communication.",
  "flows": "Reads time.monotonic() -> Updates internal counters -> Controls token availability and consumption.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code; no suspicious external calls or hidden behaviors. Code structure appears standard for rate limiting.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class that manages a token bucket for rate limiting, using system monotonic clock for timing. Methods include token calculation, refill timing, token retrieval, and token consumption. The logic is straightforward and consistent with typical rate limiter implementations. No signs of malicious activity, such as data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoors, are present. The code does not perform any suspicious operations beyond rate limiting. No obfuscation or unusual language features are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This source code appears to implement a standard rate limiter without malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, hidden functionalities, or suspicious behavior. The code is benign and primarily used for controlling resource access.",
