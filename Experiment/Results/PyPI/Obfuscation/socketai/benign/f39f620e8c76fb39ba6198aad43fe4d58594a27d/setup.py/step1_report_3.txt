{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for a Python package named 'coinbasepro' including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' and 'HISTORY.rst' files, and hardcoded dependencies list",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; the code primarily loads files and sets metadata",
  "flows": "Reads files -> assigns metadata variables -> passes dependencies to setuptools.setup()",
  "anomalies": "Use of variable names with no meaningful identifiers; no hardcoded secrets or credentials; code appears intentionally obfuscated via nonsensical variable names, which could be a sign of hiding intent but not malicious in this context.",
  "analysis": "The script reads two reStructuredText files for long description content, then sets up package metadata including name, version, description, author info, license, packages, Python version requirement, and dependencies. The variable names are obfuscated and do not reveal malicious intent; dependencies are standard and benign ('requests>=2.20.0'). No network operations, data leaks, or suspicious code execution present. The obfuscated variable names may suggest code hiding, but in this context, they only appear to be obfuscation or placeholder naming, not malicious. Overall, the script performs typical package setup functions with no indication of malicious or maliciously intended code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python setup script with obfuscated variable names. It performs benign package setup tasks, reads descriptive files, and declares dependencies. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
