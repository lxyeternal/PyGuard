  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'coinbasepro' Python package, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads README.rst and HISTORY.rst files for long description content.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no user input or network data handling present.",
  "flows": "Reads data from files, assigns to variables, then passes to setup() function for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are obfuscated or nonsensical, but this appears to be an intentional obfuscation style rather than malicious activity. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script using setuptools, with obfuscated variable names that store read file contents and dependency lists. It constructs package metadata and dependencies for distribution. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or external data exfiltration mechanisms. The obfuscation seems to be a stylistic choice rather than an attempt to hide malicious behavior. All functions and data flows are typical for a setup.py file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks are evident. It performs package configuration tasks normally seen in Python projects.",
