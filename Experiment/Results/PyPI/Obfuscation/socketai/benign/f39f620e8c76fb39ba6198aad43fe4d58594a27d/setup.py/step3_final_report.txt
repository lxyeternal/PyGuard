{
  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script that reads documentation files and configures package metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.rst' and 'HISTORY.rst' files; defines dependencies in a list.",
  "sinks": "Passes metadata to setuptools.setup() without untrusted data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Reads files into variables, then supplies data to setup() function; no external data flows or untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names but no malicious code, network activity, or data leaks; obfuscation appears stylistic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with obfuscated variable names. It performs file reading and package configuration without any suspicious behavior. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code is present. The obfuscation does not conceal malicious intent but may hinder readability. All security signals indicate benign behavior, with malware score 0 and low security risk. Obfuscation score is moderate due to variable naming but not indicative of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with superficial obfuscation. It poses no security or malware risks. The scores should reflect no malicious activity, low obfuscation impact, and minimal security risk.",
