{
  "purpose": "Set up a Python package for the Coinbase Pro API interface, including reading documentation files and specifying dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' and 'HISTORY.rst' files; defining dependencies and package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or data exfiltration points detected.",
  "flows": "Read files -> Assign content to variables -> Pass variables into setuptools.setup() -> Package installation process.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors. The variable names are obfuscated but do not indicate malicious intent; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors detected. The code uses standard setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script reads two documentation files and assigns their content to variables. It then calls setuptools.setup() with package metadata, including name, version, description, long description (constructed from the files), dependencies, license, author info, URLs, packages, and Python version requirements. The variable names are obfuscated but serve only as placeholders. There is no indication of malicious code, data leaks, or network activity. The code appears to be a standard setup script for a Python package. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup configuration script for a Python package with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
