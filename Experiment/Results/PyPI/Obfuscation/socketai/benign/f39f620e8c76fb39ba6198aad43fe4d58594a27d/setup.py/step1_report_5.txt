  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'coinbasepro' Python package, preparing installation metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading README.rst and HISTORY.rst files for long description; hardcoded package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or user input; no network or file output based on untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Reads static files, assigns metadata variables, passes dependencies into setup() function, then executes setup.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names used for data storage (e.g., MIgKHPqeXVkBwSZjolhIIXGvVxPaEVcd), but these are just variable names, not malicious code. No hardcoded secrets or credentials detected. No suspicious code behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily loads package description data from local files and defines dependencies, then calls setuptools.setup() with static parameters. The variable names appear intentionally obscure but do not indicate malicious intent. There is no network activity, user input handling, or data manipulation that could indicate malicious behavior. No obfuscated code techniques such as dynamic execution or misleading constructs are present. The script is a standard Python package setup script with unusual variable names, which do not pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with obfuscated variable names but no malicious intent or security risks detected. No signs of malware or supply chain attacks are present.",
