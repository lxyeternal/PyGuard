The obfuscation is notable but not malicious. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, and the overall security assessment should remain low risk."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code appears benign, primarily obfuscated class definitions with no evidence of malicious activity or vulnerabilities. The absence of dynamic behavior or suspicious operations indicates low security risk. However, the obfuscation alone could be used to hide malicious intent if part of a larger malicious payload. Overall, the security risk is minimal, and malware likelihood is very low."

      "conclusion": "The import statements with obfuscated class names are suspicious but do not demonstrate malicious activity by themselves. The high obfuscation warrants caution and further review of the actual class implementations and usage. Malware and risk scores should be kept low to moderate unless additional evidence emerges."

The high obfuscation score reflects suspicion but is not indicative of malware. The overall security risk is low, and malware score is zero."

Obfuscation is high, which warrants further dynamic analysis, but static review shows no malware or backdoors. The low malware score (0.1) and high obfuscation score (0.8) are appropriate. The overall security risk is moderate (0.3), primarily due to obfuscation, not malicious intent."
