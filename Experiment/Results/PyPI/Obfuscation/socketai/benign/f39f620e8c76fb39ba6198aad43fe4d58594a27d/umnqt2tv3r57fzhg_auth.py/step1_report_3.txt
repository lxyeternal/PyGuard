  "purpose": "Implement an HMAC-based authentication class for signing API requests with custom headers.",
  "sources": "time.time() for timestamp, request.method, request.path_url, request.body, self.secret_key, self.api_key, self.passphrase",
  "sinks": "request.headers.update() for adding authentication headers",
  "flows": "timestamp + request method + URL + body -> HMAC signature -> request headers",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; use of base64 decode on secret_key which could be misused if secret_key is compromised; no input validation or sanitization observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines an authentication class that computes an HMAC signature based on the current timestamp, request method, URL, and body, then adds custom headers including the signature, timestamp, API key, and passphrase. The secret key is decoded from base64, which is standard for handling encoded secrets. The flow appears to be a typical API signing process, with no suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious intent detected. No obfuscated or malicious code constructs are present. The use of standard libraries and practices aligns with secure API request signing. There are no indications of data exfiltration, malicious network activity, or backdoors. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate implementation of an API request signer, with no malicious or suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of an API request signing class for authentication purposes. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The overall security risk is low.",
