  "purpose": "Create an authenticated request class for API access, signing requests with HMAC and managing API credentials.",
  "sources": "self.secret_key (decoded with base64), request.body, request.method, request.path_url, self.api_key, self.passphrase",
  "sinks": "request.headers update with signature, timestamp, and credentials",
  "flows": "secret_key (base64 decode) + request data -> HMAC signature -> request headers",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic time for signing, no hardcoded credentials (though passed via constructor), no external data leaks, no suspicious request modifications",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard HMAC signing process for API request authentication. It decodes the secret key from base64, constructs a string from timestamp, request method, URL, and body, then signs it with HMAC SHA-256. The resulting signature, along with credentials and timestamp, is added to request headers. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are present. The code appears to perform typical API request signing with proper cryptographic practices. No malicious or backdoor behaviors are detected, and no obfuscation or malware-like activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a typical API request signer using HMAC. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. It performs expected cryptographic signing for API authentication, with no suspicious code patterns.",
