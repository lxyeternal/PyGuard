  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated Coinbase API client with no direct evidence of malicious activity. Obfuscation is high, which warrants further dynamic analysis, but static review shows no malware or backdoors. The low malware score (0.1) and high obfuscation score (0.8) are appropriate. The overall security risk is moderate (0.3), primarily due to obfuscation, not malicious intent."
