  "purpose": "Obfuscated Python class extending Coinbase Pro API client, providing methods for account management, transactions, and reports.",
  "sources": "Input data from method parameters, environment variables (potentially), and API responses from network calls (not shown).",
  "sinks": "API request functions (e.g., self.AMkTOqdyhHPAVotGTIKHwKBDprjLYZwi) potentially send data over the network; no explicit data exfiltration or malicious network activity evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from method inputs through data serialization (json.dumps) into API request functions, with responses processed and returned; no suspicious data flow patterns identified.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation via nonsensical import and class/method names, placeholder variables like 'Decimal' not instantiated, inconsistent naming conventions, and complex method structures without clear documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as an API wrapper for Coinbase Pro, with obfuscated identifiers and non-descriptive method names. No explicit malicious code, such as network connections to suspicious domains, data exfiltration, or backdoors, is visible. The obfuscation raises suspicion but may be intended for concealment or protection. The use of json.dumps before API calls suggests standard data handling. The placeholder 'Decimal' variables are not instantiated, indicating possible incomplete or intentionally misleading code. Overall, the code's behavior appears benign but warrants caution due to obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated Coinbase API client with no direct evidence of malicious activity. Obfuscation is high, which warrants further dynamic analysis, but static review shows no malware or backdoors. The low malware score (0.1) and high obfuscation score (0.8) are appropriate. The overall security risk is moderate (0.3), primarily due to obfuscation, not malicious intent.",
