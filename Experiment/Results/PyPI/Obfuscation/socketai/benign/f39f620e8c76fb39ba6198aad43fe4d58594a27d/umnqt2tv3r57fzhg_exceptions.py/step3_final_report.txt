{
  "purpose": "Obfuscated class definitions inheriting from standard exceptions with static string attributes, likely placeholders or dummy code.",
  "sources": "Class attribute assignments; no input or data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, no data leaks, no security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow involving untrusted sources; code only defines classes and constants.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated class names and attribute names; no functional code; no network, file, or execution activity; static string values appear arbitrary.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of several classes with obfuscated names, inheriting from built-in exceptions, and containing static string attributes. There are no functions, method calls, or logic that could be malicious. The obfuscation may be for concealment or placeholder purposes. No network activity, data handling, or code execution is present. The lack of any suspicious operations or malicious payloads suggests benign intent, though obfuscation warrants cautious review if used maliciously. The code does not demonstrate vulnerabilities or malicious behavior based solely on static analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, primarily obfuscated class definitions with no evidence of malicious activity or vulnerabilities. The absence of dynamic behavior or suspicious operations indicates low security risk. However, the obfuscation alone could be used to hide malicious intent if part of a larger malicious payload. Overall, the security risk is minimal, and malware likelihood is very low.",
