  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data usage or output",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input or sensitive data",
  "anomalies": "The variable name appears obfuscated or nonsensical; no context provided",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a string '3.2.0' to a variable with an obfuscated name. There are no input sources, no data sinks, and no operations that suggest malicious activity. The obfuscated variable name raises suspicion but could be harmless. No further code is provided, so no malicious behavior can be confirmed. This appears to be a benign, isolated variable declaration with obfuscated naming.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal, benign variable assignment with an obfuscated name; no malicious behavior detected. Insufficient context to suggest malicious intent, but the obfuscated variable name warrants caution if part of larger code.",
