  "purpose": "Store a version string for the package or module.",
  "sources": "Assignment to a variable containing a version number string.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no data flow to external systems or sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "Variable name appears obfuscated or nonsensical; the value is a static version string with no immediate malicious content.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a variable assignment where a string '3.2.0' is assigned to a variable with an obfuscated name. There are no inputs, no external data reads, and no suspicious functions or operations. The variable name does not reveal clear purpose, but the value appears to be a standard version identifier. No malicious code, obfuscated logic, or suspicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment appears benign, likely serving as a version identifier. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
