  "purpose": "Importing specific classes or functions from a module within the jaanca_chronometer package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'jaanca_chronometer.utils.helpers.chronometer'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data are present in this code fragment.",
  "flows": "The imported classes or functions may be used elsewhere in the code, but no data flow analysis can be performed from this snippet alone.",
  "anomalies": "Imported identifiers 'TlypwQVLLSTPeTnIWbNgNGaFTAZsWgFC' and 'bmACOIxzFDRNwzknWpYkuRoHlHXJfKkn' are obfuscated, non-descriptive, and appear as random strings, which is suspicious. No other code or logic is present that clarifies their purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement, importing two obfuscated names from a module. The obfuscated identifiers suggest possible hiding of malicious or maliciously intended functions/classes, as such naming is often used to evade detection. However, without additional context or implementation details, it is impossible to determine their actual behavior. No data flow, execution, or suspicious activity can be assessed from this fragment alone.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet appears to be a simple import statement with obfuscated identifiers, which could be a red flag for malicious intent or concealment. However, with only this fragment, there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior. Further investigation of the imported entities and usage in the larger codebase is necessary.",
