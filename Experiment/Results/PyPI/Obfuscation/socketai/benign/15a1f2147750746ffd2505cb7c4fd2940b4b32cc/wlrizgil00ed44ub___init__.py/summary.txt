  "conclusion": "The import statement uses obfuscated identifiers, which is suspicious but not inherently malicious. The low malware score aligns with the lack of active malicious code. High obfuscation scores suggest caution. Further investigation into the imported modules is recommended to rule out concealed malicious behavior."
