  "purpose": "Import obfuscated components from a nested module within jaanca_chronometer.utils.helpers.chronometer.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no other data sources are present in the snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows are evident in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; only an import statement with no further code execution shown.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated, non-descriptive identifiers for imported components, which could indicate concealment or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement importing two components with obfuscated names. No active malicious behavior or data flows are present. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. Scores for malware are low (0.1-0.2), reflecting no direct evidence of harm. Obfuscation scores are high (0.75-0.8), consistent with suspicious naming. Security risk scores are moderate (0.3), acknowledging potential concealment but no active threat. The overall assessment indicates that the import alone is not malicious but warrants further review of the imported components and their usage in the broader codebase.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement uses obfuscated identifiers, which is suspicious but not inherently malicious. The low malware score aligns with the lack of active malicious code. High obfuscation scores suggest caution. Further investigation into the imported modules is recommended to rule out concealed malicious behavior.",
