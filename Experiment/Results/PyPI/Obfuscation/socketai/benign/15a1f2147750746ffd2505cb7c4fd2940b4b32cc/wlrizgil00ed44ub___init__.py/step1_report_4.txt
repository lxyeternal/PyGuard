  "purpose": "Import specific classes or functions from a nested module within the 'jaanca_chronometer' package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'jaanca_chronometer.utils.helpers.chronometer' module.",
  "sinks": "No direct sink such as executing untrusted input, network communication, or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "The imported classes/functions may be used elsewhere in the codebase; this snippet alone does not show data flows.",
  "anomalies": "Imported identifiers 'TlypwQVLLSTPeTnIWbNgNGaFTAZsWgFC' and 'bmACOIxzFDRNwzknWpYkuRoHlHXJfKkn' are non-descriptive, potentially obfuscated names; no other suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement, referencing classes or functions with non-descriptive, seemingly obfuscated names. The naming could suggest an attempt to hide intent, but based solely on this snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior. No data sources, sinks, or suspicious operations are present. The import appears standard for a module structure, but the obfuscated identifiers warrant caution as they may be used later for malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward import statement with obfuscated identifiers. While the naming raises suspicion, there is no direct evidence of malicious activity in this snippet. Further context would be needed to confirm malicious intent.",
