{
  "purpose": "Import specific classes or functions from a module within the jaanca_chronometer package, likely for utility or timing functionalities.",
  "sources": "Import statement reading from 'jaanca_chronometer.utils.helpers.chronometer'.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks present; the code only performs an import.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; only static import without execution of imported code.",
  "anomalies": "Imported names 'TlypwQVLLSTPeTnIWbNgNGaFTAZsWgFC' and 'bmACOIxzFDRNwzknWpYkuRoHlHXJfKkn' appear as obfuscated or randomly generated identifiers, which is unusual for standard code and could indicate obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward import of two components with obfuscated names from a nested module. The obfuscated identifiers are suspicious, as they do not reflect meaningful naming conventions. Since only the import statement is present, there is no active malicious behavior, but the use of obfuscated names raises concern about potential hidden functionality or code obfuscation aimed at hiding malicious behavior. There are no other operations, inputs, or data handling present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement but uses obfuscated names for imported components, which may indicate an attempt to hide malicious or undesired behavior. As it stands, it does not perform malicious actions directly but warrants further review of the imported module and context.",
