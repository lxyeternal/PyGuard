{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility function, but without specific comments or documentation, the exact intent is unclear.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from environment variables and possibly from function arguments or external modules. There are no explicit user input prompts or file reads shown.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or system commands, but these are not clearly evident without further context or code segments.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or function parameters to processing functions, with potential outputs to logs, network, or files, but explicit flow paths are not detailed in the snippet provided.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are immediately visible. The code does not display obfuscation or unusual language features. Lack of comments makes intent less clear.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and appears to follow standard Python practices. No malicious code or security risks such as data leakage, code injection, or insecure operations are evident. Usage of third-party libraries is not inherently suspicious. The absence of explicit network or file operations reduces immediate concern. Without additional context or hidden modules, the likelihood of malicious behavior appears low.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no apparent malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems benign but limited in detail. Confidence in this assessment is high due to lack of suspicious patterns.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
