{
  "purpose": "To evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and anomalies, ensuring supply chain integrity.",
  "sources": "Input data reading points, such as file reads, environment variables, network requests, or user inputs.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network transmissions, file modifications, or system commands that could be exploited if untrusted data is processed.",
  "flows": "Data flow from sources to sinks, including variable assignments, function calls, or dynamic code execution pathways.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded secrets, suspicious network domains, unusual code constructs, unnecessary dynamic execution, or hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be routine utility scripts with no signs of obfuscation or malicious activity. Confidence levels vary but are generally moderate to high, reflecting limited code context. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are detected. The absence of code snippets limits certainty, but the reasoning aligns with low risk and malware scores. The low security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate given the descriptions. No anomalies or obfuscation are present. Overall, the code is benign, and the risk assessment is justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk score is appropriate, and the assessments across all reports are consistent with the provided descriptions. No adjustments are necessary.",
