      "conclusion": "The script is a benign package setup with obfuscated variable names and a syntax error at the end. There is no evidence of malicious code or activity. The obfuscation and syntax error suggest caution but do not constitute an active threat. Fixing the syntax error and reviewing the source is recommended before deployment."

      "conclusion": "The import statement uses obfuscated identifiers, which is suspicious but not inherently malicious. The low malware score aligns with the lack of active malicious code. High obfuscation scores suggest caution. Further investigation into the imported modules is recommended to rule out concealed malicious behavior."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "Most reports are accurately scored, with the primary recommendation to slightly raise the malware score in report 3 from 0.3 to 0.4 to better represent the suspicious code patterns. The benign reports are appropriately scored. The overall security risk remains moderate, reflecting the presence of obfuscation and dynamic code execution in some snippets but no confirmed malicious payloads."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate timing utility with obfuscated identifiers. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or sabotage. The obfuscation appears to be for concealment rather than malicious intent. The overall security risk is minimal, and the malware score remains at 0.0."
