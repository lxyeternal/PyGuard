  "conclusion": "Most reports are accurately scored, with the primary recommendation to slightly raise the malware score in report 3 from 0.3 to 0.4 to better represent the suspicious code patterns. The benign reports are appropriately scored. The overall security risk remains moderate, reflecting the presence of obfuscation and dynamic code execution in some snippets but no confirmed malicious payloads."
