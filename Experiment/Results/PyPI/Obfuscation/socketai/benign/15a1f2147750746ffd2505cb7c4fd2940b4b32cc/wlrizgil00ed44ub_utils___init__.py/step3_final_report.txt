  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, external files, code execution functions (exec, eval), hardcoded credentials, data inputs from untrusted sources.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file operations, subprocess calls, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or user input to sinks like network or file operations, often via dynamic execution or obfuscated code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec, high obfuscation scores (~0.7), hardcoded secrets, convoluted code structure, dynamic code execution, suspicious data sources.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are common in malicious scripts to hide intent. The suspicious patterns include eval/exec usage, obfuscation, and potential data exfiltration points. Benign code shows straightforward structure with no suspicious features. The scores assigned (malware ~0.4, obfuscated ~0.7, risk ~0.6) are consistent with the described behaviors. Slightly increasing malware scores for reports with obfuscation and dynamic code (e.g., from 0.3 to 0.4) would better reflect the suspicion. Overall, the assessments are justified and align with the observed patterns.",
  "conclusion": "Most reports are accurately scored, with the primary recommendation to slightly raise the malware score in report 3 from 0.3 to 0.4 to better represent the suspicious code patterns. The benign reports are appropriately scored. The overall security risk remains moderate, reflecting the presence of obfuscation and dynamic code execution in some snippets but no confirmed malicious payloads.",
