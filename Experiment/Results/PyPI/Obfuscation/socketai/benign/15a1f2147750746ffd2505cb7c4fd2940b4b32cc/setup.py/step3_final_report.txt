{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup configuration script for a Python package, defining metadata such as name, version, description, classifiers, and dependencies using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads static package metadata variables and the setup() function call; no external or untrusted data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks; the script only defines package info.",
  "flows": "The setup() function uses the defined variables to configure package metadata; no data flows from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names and an incomplete line at the end ('UyHIZABeTRxokSNGNQrRUhxOoDOkMDIN='), which causes a syntax error, are suspicious. The last line lacks a value and closing parenthesis, indicating incomplete or corrupted code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names, which may be an attempt to conceal intent. The syntax error at the end prevents execution and could be accidental or intentional to hide malicious payloads. No dynamic code, network activity, or malicious functions are present. The obfuscation alone does not imply malicious behavior, but the syntax error warrants caution. The malware score is appropriately zero; the obfuscation score is high due to nonsensical variable names; the overall security risk is low but slightly elevated because of the syntax error and obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign package setup with obfuscated variable names and a syntax error at the end. There is no evidence of malicious code or activity. The obfuscation and syntax error suggest caution but do not constitute an active threat. Fixing the syntax error and reviewing the source is recommended before deployment.",
