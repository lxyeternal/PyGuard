{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package named 'wlrizgil00ed44ub', intended to configure package metadata and installation requirements.",
  "sources": "The code reads static string variables defining package name, version, description, license, classifiers, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or inputs are present; the script uses hardcoded package metadata only.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from external sources to sinks; the script purely defines static data.",
  "anomalies": "The variable names are intentionally obfuscated or nonsensical, but they contain no malicious content. The code appears to be a standard setup script with altered variable naming, likely to evade simple static analysis.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and defines several variables with obfuscated names, assigning static string values that relate to package metadata. The 'setup()' function is called with these variables, setting up package configuration. No dynamic execution, external inputs, or suspicious operations are present. The obfuscation seems solely for hiding intent or complicating analysis, not for malicious purposes. There are no indications of malware or malicious behavior, nor any suspicious network or system activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script with obfuscated variable names. It contains no malicious code, malware, or security risks. The obfuscation appears to be a superficial measure to conceal variable names rather than an attempt to hide malicious behavior.",
