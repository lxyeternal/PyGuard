  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a specific task or functionality, but the exact purpose cannot be determined as the code is missing or not provided.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables, user input via functions, or external files, but specific source locations are not visible due to missing code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or execution of dynamic code, but without the code, specific sinks cannot be identified.",
  "flows": "There is an implied flow from input sources through processing functions towards sinks such as network or file operations, but specific flow paths are not evident without the code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns can be identified due to the absence of code snippets. Missing code prevents detection of hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "Insufficient code provided to perform a detailed analysis. Cannot identify sources, sinks, or flows, nor detect anomalies. Unable to evaluate potential malware or security risks without actual code content.",
  "conclusion": "Unable to determine the purpose, behavior, or security implications of the code due to missing code content. No suspicious activity can be confirmed or ruled out.",
