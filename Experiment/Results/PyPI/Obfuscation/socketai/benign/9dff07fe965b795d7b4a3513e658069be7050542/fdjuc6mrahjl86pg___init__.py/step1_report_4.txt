{
  "purpose": "The code imports all functions, classes, and variables from a module named 'yuag' within the same package.",
  "sources": "Import statement: 'from .yuag import *' which loads all symbols from the local 'yuag' module.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks depend on what is imported from 'yuag', but generally, if the imported module contains functions that handle untrusted data or perform system actions, they could be sinks.",
  "flows": "Data flows depend on how imported symbols are used elsewhere; the current snippet does not show usage, only the import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'import *' can be considered an anomaly due to poor code clarity and potential for importing malicious or unintended symbols, but the statement itself is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "This code solely consists of an import statement that brings all symbols from a local module 'yuag'. Without further context, this is a standard Python import pattern, although using 'import *' can obscure dependencies and increase risk if the imported module is malicious. No other code or data handling is present to assess.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no direct malicious behavior. However, the use of 'import *' warrants caution, especially if 'yuag' contains malicious code or untrusted content. No immediate security risk or malware indicators are apparent from this snippet alone.",
