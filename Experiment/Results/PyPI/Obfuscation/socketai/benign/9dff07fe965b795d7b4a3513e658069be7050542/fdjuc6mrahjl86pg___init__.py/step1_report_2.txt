  "purpose": "Import all functions, classes, or variables from the local module 'yuag'.",
  "sources": "The module 'yuag' within the same package directory.",
  "sinks": "Potentially any code that utilizes imported entities; no direct sinks in this line.",
  "flows": "Imported elements from 'yuag' may flow into subsequent code where they could be misused.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import (*) which can obscure which symbols are imported; no suspicious behavior directly from this line.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard relative import from a module named 'yuag'. The use of 'from .yuag import *' is generally discouraged due to namespace pollution and potential for hiding malicious or unintended code, but on its own, it does not indicate malicious intent. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks solely from this line. To fully assess, one would need to examine the contents of 'yuag'.",
  "conclusion": "This line performs a relative import with a wildcard, which is potentially unsafe for code clarity and maintainability but does not inherently indicate malicious behavior or malware. No immediate security risks are evident from this single statement.",
