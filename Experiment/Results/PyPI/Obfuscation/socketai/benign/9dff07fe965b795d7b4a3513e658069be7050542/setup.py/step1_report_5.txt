  "purpose": "Define and configure the Python package setup with minimal dependencies.",
  "sources": "Setuptools import and setup() function call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data outputs detected.",
  "flows": "Imported modules used solely for package configuration; no data flows involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Package name appears to be a random string; no version control or meaningful metadata provided; no suspicious code or behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() with a package name and version. The package name appears to be a random string, which might be used to obfuscate or hide purpose, but there is no evidence of malicious behavior. The install_requires list is empty, indicating no dependencies. There are no input sources, data flows, or potentially malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks present. The structure is standard for a Python package setup file, with no signs of obfuscation or malware.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward package setup script with a non-descriptive package name. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The code performs its intended function without any indicators of malicious intent.",
