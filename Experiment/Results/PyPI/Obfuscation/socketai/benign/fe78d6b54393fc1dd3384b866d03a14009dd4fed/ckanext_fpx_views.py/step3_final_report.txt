  "justification": "The assessments across all reports are generally cautious and consistent with the limited code evidence. Report 3's high obfuscation warrants a higher suspicion level, so increasing the malware score slightly from 0.2 to 0.1–0.4 is appropriate; here, 0.1 reflects minimal suspicion without concrete malicious activity. The overall scores balance the suspicion from obfuscation and dynamic features against the lack of definitive malicious indicators, leading to a moderate overall risk. Further dynamic analysis is recommended for conclusive results.",
