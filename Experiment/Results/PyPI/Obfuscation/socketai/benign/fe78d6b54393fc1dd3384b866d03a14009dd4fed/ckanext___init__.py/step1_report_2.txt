{
  "purpose": "Establish a namespace package to support plugin or extension mechanisms.",
  "sources": "Import statements: 'import pkg_resources' and 'import pkgutil'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no data leakage or malicious action points identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; namespace declaration is static and safe.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and follows standard namespace declaration patterns. No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to declare a namespace package using 'pkg_resources' and falls back to 'pkgutil' if 'pkg_resources' is unavailable. This is a common pattern for supporting namespace packages across different environments. The code does not process any external input, perform network activity, or execute any malicious or obscure operations. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation for namespace packages, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions to support plugin architectures and does not introduce security concerns.",
