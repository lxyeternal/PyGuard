  "purpose": "Standard namespace package declaration pattern in Python, supporting modular distribution across multiple directories or packages.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'pkg_resources' and 'pkgutil', and the namespace declaration or extension logic.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, external communication, or data sinks; the code solely manages namespace paths.",
  "flows": "Import of modules -> declaration of namespace or extension of __path__ -> no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code employs a common, well-known pattern with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import 'pkg_resources' and declares a namespace with 'declare_namespace(__name__)'. If 'pkg_resources' is unavailable, it falls back to 'pkgutil' to extend '__path__'. This pattern is standard in Python packaging for namespace support. No untrusted input, network activity, or malicious behavior is present. The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify this pattern as benign, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0. The code's purpose is solely to facilitate namespace sharing, and no vulnerabilities or malicious actions are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard namespace package declaration pattern with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports accurately assess its safety, and the scoring is appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.",
