{
  "purpose": "To declare a namespace for a Python package, enabling the distribution of a single logical package across multiple directories.",
  "sources": "The import statements for 'pkg_resources' and 'pkgutil', and the declaration of '__path__'.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external system effects present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only sets up namespace packaging.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses standard namespace declaration patterns; no anomalies or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to declare a namespace using 'pkg_resources' if available, otherwise falls back to 'pkgutil' to extend '__path__'. These are common practices for creating namespace packages in Python. There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious functions. The code performs only namespace setup without any external communication, data handling, or sensitive operations.",
  "conclusion": "This is standard namespace package setup code with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It serves to enable package modularity and distribution.",
