{
  "purpose": "This code sets up namespace declaration for a Python package, allowing it to be split across multiple distribution packages.",
  "sources": "Import statements: 'import pkg_resources' and 'import pkgutil'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present. The code does not process untrusted data or perform I/O operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only declares a namespace with no external input or output.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses namespace declaration which is standard for namespace packages; no unusual or suspicious code constructs or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to declare a namespace for the current package, using 'pkg_resources' if available, falling back to 'pkgutil' otherwise. This pattern is common for supporting namespace packages in Python. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious activity. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard practices for namespace packages.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard namespace package setup code with no malicious intent or security concerns. It does not read external input or perform actions that could be malicious.",
