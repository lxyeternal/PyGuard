  "purpose": "Configure package data inclusion and message extractors for the 'ckanext.fpx' Python package.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the 'setuptools' module import and the arguments to the 'setup' function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data transmissions are present.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing 'setuptools' to calling 'setup' with configuration dictionaries; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The configuration appears standard for a Python package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'setuptools' module and calls 'setup' with two dictionaries: 'package_data' specifying asset files to include, and 'message_extractors' configuring message extraction patterns for various file types. Both configurations are typical for packaging and internationalization purposes. There are no dynamic code executions, external data reads, or suspicious behaviors present. The code structure is straightforward and aligns with common package setup practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard package setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain hardcoded secrets or malicious data flows.",
