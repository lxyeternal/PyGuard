  "purpose": "Static package configuration for setuptools, defining package data and message extractors.",
  "sources": "No external inputs; static dictionaries within setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external data flows; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow; static setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() with predefined static dictionaries for package data and message extractors. There are no dynamic inputs, external data, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The code is a typical setup script used for packaging Python projects. All signals indicate benign configuration with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score should be 0, obfuscated score 0, and risk score effectively 0, reflecting its safe and static nature.",
