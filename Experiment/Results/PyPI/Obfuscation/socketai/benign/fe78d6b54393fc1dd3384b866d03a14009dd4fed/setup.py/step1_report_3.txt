  "purpose": "Configure package data and message extractors for the 'ckanext.fpx' Python package.",
  "sources": "The 'setup' function call with parameters 'package_data' and 'message_extractors'.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data sinks such as network, file writes, or eval functions.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; configuration data is static and explicitly defined.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Use of standard setup tools and configurations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup configuration for a Python package, specifying package data files and message extraction rules. No dynamic code execution, input reading, or network activity is present. It uses standard 'setuptools' practices without suspicious patterns or behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
