  "purpose": "Configure package data and message extractors for the 'ckanext.fpx' package during setup.",
  "sources": "The code reads package data ('assets/**/*') and message extraction configurations from hardcoded parameters in the setup() call.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, if the package data or message extractors process untrusted input or are misused, but as is, it primarily defines static configuration.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code executes static configuration commands during setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected. Usage of setuptools for configuration is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the setup function from setuptools and calls it with static arguments to define package data and message extractors. All data appears hardcoded and related to package configuration. There are no dynamic inputs, external network calls, or unusual code constructs. This is typical setup script code, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package. No malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, and no security concerns identified. It is a benign configuration script.",
