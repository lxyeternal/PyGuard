  "purpose": "Configure package data and message extractors for a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads package_data and message_extractors dictionaries directly in code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; the code primarily defines static configuration data.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; static assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() with static dictionaries specifying package assets and message extractors. All data is hardcoded; no external inputs or untrusted data sources are involved. The configuration appears standard for localization and asset management within a Python package. No obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration for packaging, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
