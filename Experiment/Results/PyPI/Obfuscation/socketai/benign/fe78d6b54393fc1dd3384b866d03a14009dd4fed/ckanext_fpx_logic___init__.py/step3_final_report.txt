{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a Python package with limited explicit malicious activity; potential obfuscation is noted but no concrete malicious functions or behaviors are identified.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, files, or network sources, but specifics are not provided.",
  "sinks": "Potential network communication, file operations, or system commands, though no explicit code is shown.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or files to system/network operations, but no explicit source-to-sink path is demonstrated.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names and complex constructs are present, but no hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns are confirmed.",
  "analysis": "The code lacks explicit malicious functions or behaviors. Obfuscation is minimal and does not indicate malicious intent. The absence of concrete code prevents definitive conclusions, but the cautious scores reflect the uncertainty. The low malware score (0.1) and low security risk (0.2) are appropriate given the limited evidence. The obfuscation score (0.3) in report 1 is justified by the mention of obscure variable names. Overall, the assessments are consistent and justified.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the limited information, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior. The scores are appropriately cautious, reflecting potential obfuscation but no concrete threats. No significant revisions are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.75,
  "obfuscated": 0.3,
  "malware": 0.1,
