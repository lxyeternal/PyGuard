  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code reading input data, environment variables, network connections, file operations, dynamic execution points.",
  "sinks": "Network transmissions, file writes, environment variable access, system commands, data leaks.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input or environment variables flow into processing functions, which may reach sinks like network or file system.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected; code appears benign and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate minimal or no code, with low confidence in malicious activity. The detailed reasoning aligns with the low malware and obfuscation scores. Risk scores are low, reflecting limited concern. No evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation is present. The scores are consistent with the descriptions and observations across all reports.",
  "conclusion": "The code reviews suggest benign behavior with no malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The low risk and malware scores are appropriate. The assessments are consistent and justified given the limited or absent code. No adjustments are necessary.",
