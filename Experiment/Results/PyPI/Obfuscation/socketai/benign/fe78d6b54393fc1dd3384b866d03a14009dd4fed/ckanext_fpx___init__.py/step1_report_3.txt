  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is to perform data processing or system interaction, but no explicit purpose can be determined from the provided snippet.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function parameters and possibly environment variables or external files if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, file writes, or execution of commands, but none are explicitly visible in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) to sinks (outputs or actions), but no clear source-to-sink flow is observable in the provided code.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are apparent; the code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code provided is minimal or absent, making it difficult to identify specific security issues or malicious behavior. No external library misuse, suspicious logic, or malicious intent is evident. Given the lack of details, it is likely benign but insufficient for a thorough review.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears standard, with no anomalies or signs of obfuscation. However, the review is limited by the absence of detailed code.",
