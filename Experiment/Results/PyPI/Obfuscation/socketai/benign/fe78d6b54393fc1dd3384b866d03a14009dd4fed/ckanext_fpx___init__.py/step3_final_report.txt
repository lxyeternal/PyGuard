  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on code review and report analysis.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, user inputs, modules, network/file/system operations.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, system commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) to sinks (outputs), potentially via dynamic execution or obfuscation.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated code (score ~0.3), dynamic execution, suspicious imports, minimal or no code provided.",
  "analysis": "All reports generally indicate low malicious activity with some obfuscation. Report 1 notes obfuscation at 0.3 but no malware, with a security risk of 0.2 and confidence 0.75. Other reports lack code, with scores of zero for malware and obfuscation, and low risk (~0.2). The scores are consistent with their conclusions. Minor adjustment recommended for Report 3's risk score from 0.2 to 0 to better reflect absence of code. Overall, the malware score remains 0, obfuscation around 0.2-0.3, and risk around 0.1-0.2.",
  "conclusion": "The overall assessment indicates a low security risk with minimal or no malicious activity detected. The scores across reports are consistent with their analyses. Minor adjustment to Report 3's risk score improves accuracy. No significant concerns or high malware likelihood are present.",
