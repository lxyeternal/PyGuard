{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of pytest unit tests for 'sodapy.utils', testing response handling, data filtering, exception raising, and file operations.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions, mock responses, temporary file paths",
  "sinks": "Function calls that process responses, file read/write operations",
  "flows": "Input parameters and mock responses flow into utility functions, which may process or raise exceptions based on input",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated or nonsensical function and variable names (e.g., oAJXKjlLqjLATiBPTwOzEmhoVnLGWgqN), which could suggest obfuscation or placeholder code",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple pytest test functions that validate utility functions in 'sodapy.utils'. All tests involve standard input, mocking network responses, exception handling, and file operations. No hardcoded secrets, network connections outside mocks, or data exfiltration are present. The obfuscated naming in some functions is unusual but does not inherently indicate malicious intent; it may be a form of obfuscation or placeholder naming. The tests do not perform any harmful actions such as system modifications, network exfiltration, or data theft. The overall structure and content suggest benign test code with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test suite for utility functions, with some obfuscation in naming but no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. The malware score is 0, the obfuscation score is high (~0.75) due to naming patterns, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2). The code does not pose a supply chain threat or malicious sabotage.",
