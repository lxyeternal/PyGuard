{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of pytest test cases for a utility module 'sodapy.utils', testing HTTP responses, data filtering, exception handling, and file operations.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include function parameters, HTTP responses (mocked), and temporary files.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are HTTP request handling, raising exceptions, file writing, and calling utility functions that may perform data processing or network operations.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (sources) are used in functions that process data, potentially leading to network requests or file operations (sinks). For example, mocked HTTP responses are processed by utility functions; test assertions validate the behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are observed. All code appears to be standard test scaffolding with parameterized inputs. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are present. The use of mocking is standard for tests; no malicious or hidden behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple pytest test functions validating utility functions from 'sodapy.utils'. Tests include response handling with different status codes, data filtering, exception raising, and file operations. Mocking is used for HTTP requests. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful system modifications. The code appears to be legitimate test code designed for verifying utility functions. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads are present. The functions under test seem to perform data filtering, exception handling, and network file fetching in a typical, benign manner.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of unit tests for a utility module with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It does not include malicious payloads or behaviors. The overall security risk score is low, and confidence in this assessment is high.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
