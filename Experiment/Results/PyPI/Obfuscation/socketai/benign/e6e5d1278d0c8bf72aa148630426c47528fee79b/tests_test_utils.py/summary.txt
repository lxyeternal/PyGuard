  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test suite for utility functions, with some obfuscation in naming but no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. The malware score is 0, the obfuscation score is high (~0.75) due to naming patterns, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2). The code does not pose a supply chain threat or malicious sabotage."
