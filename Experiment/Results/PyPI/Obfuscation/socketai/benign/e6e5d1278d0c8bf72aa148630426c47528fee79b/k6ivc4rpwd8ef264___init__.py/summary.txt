  "conclusion": "The code exhibits obfuscation that raises suspicion but does not contain explicit malicious actions. The high obfuscation scores are justified, and the moderate malware and risk scores are appropriate given the pattern. Further investigation of the imported modules and their runtime behavior is recommended before trusting or deploying this code."
