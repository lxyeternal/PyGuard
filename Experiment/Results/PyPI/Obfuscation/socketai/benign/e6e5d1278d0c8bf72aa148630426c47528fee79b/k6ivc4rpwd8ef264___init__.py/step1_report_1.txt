{
  "purpose": "Import specific classes or functions from third-party 'sodapy' library, assign one of the imported classes to a variable, and expose 'Socrata' in the module's public interface.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'sodapy.socrata' and 'sodapy', assignment from imported module to a variable.",
  "sinks": "Assignment to variable 'BifSwUpMyZBPDLOEOvmCfSwbDpRkGGYy' which could potentially be used later in the code.",
  "flows": "Imported classes/functions → assigned to variable 'BifSwUpMyZBPDLOEOvmCfSwbDpRkGGYy'.",
  "anomalies": "The imported symbols 'idiYSJQFAswNFpTzefCqDHxWJyDhCjUK' and 'AXKaJxJexcdbCZJLYnFtpGXIbPunUudz' are obfuscated or nonsensical, suggesting possible obfuscation or malicious intent. The assignment of an imported attribute to an equally obfuscated variable name adds to suspicion. No meaningful variable or function names are used, which is unusual and could be an attempt to hide malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes or functions from a well-known library 'sodapy' but uses nonsensical names for imported symbols, which do not match the expected public API. The import names appear obfuscated, possibly to hide malicious behavior or make analysis difficult. The code then assigns an attribute from an imported module to a similarly obfuscated variable, which could be a backdoor or hidden data exfiltration point. There is no apparent validation, sanitization, or security checks. Overall, the obfuscated import names and assignment pattern raise suspicion of hiding malicious code or behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code uses obfuscated import names and assigns imported attributes to obscure variable names, which is suspicious. While the visible code does not directly perform malicious actions, the obfuscation and pattern suggest potential malicious intent or backdoor setup. Further analysis of the actual contents of the imported modules and subsequent code is recommended before safe use.",
