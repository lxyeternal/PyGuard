      "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names and the use of exec() to load version info. No evidence of malware or malicious behavior is present. The main security concern is the exec() pattern, which could be exploited if 'version.py' is compromised. The uninitialized variable indicates a bug but not malicious intent. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscation is moderate, and the overall security risk is moderate due to the exec() usage. It is recommended to replace exec() with a safer import or parsing method for version info."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, albeit obfuscated, API client library. There is no evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, or sabotage. The primary concern is the obfuscation, which could hinder analysis or be exploited if inputs are malicious. Overall, the malware risk is very low, obfuscation is moderate to high, and the overall security risk is low to moderate. The scores should be adjusted to reflect a malware score of approximately 0.1, obfuscation around 0.6, and a security risk of about 0.2."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits obfuscation that raises suspicion but does not contain explicit malicious actions. The high obfuscation scores are justified, and the moderate malware and risk scores are appropriate given the pattern. Further investigation of the imported modules and their runtime behavior is recommended before trusting or deploying this code."

The malware score is 0, indicating no malicious intent. The obfuscation score is around 0.6, reflecting the non-descriptive naming, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, indicating low risk. Overall, the code appears benign, with obfuscation as the primary concern."

The low malware score (0) and low security risk (0.2) are justified. Obfuscation is moderate but typical in test code, and no secrets or payloads are present. It is safe within a testing environment, though obfuscation should be reviewed if encountered outside such contexts."

The malware score is 0, the obfuscation score is high (~0.75) due to naming patterns, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2). The code does not pose a supply chain threat or malicious sabotage."

The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. Overall, the code appears benign, with a low malware score and moderate obfuscation. Further context is needed to determine if the obfuscation is malicious or legitimate."
