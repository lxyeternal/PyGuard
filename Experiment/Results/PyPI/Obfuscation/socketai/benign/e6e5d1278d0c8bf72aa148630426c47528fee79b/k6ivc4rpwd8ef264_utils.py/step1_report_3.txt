  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling HTTP responses, URL generation, data processing, and file downloading within a larger application.",
  "sources": "Reads from imported constants, request responses, and function arguments (potentially untrusted inputs).",
  "sinks": "Uses request.get() to download content and writes data to local files; potential for data exfiltration or resource exhaustion.",
  "flows": "Data flows from URL or data parameters through request functions and into file system writes, or through string formatting into URLs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Use of try-except for specific error handling is typical.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard operations such as HTTP error handling, URL construction, parameter validation, and file downloading. It validates inputs for URL and dataset identifiers, ensuring at least one required parameter is provided. The URL construction functions combine constants with arguments securely via string formatting. The download function streams content and writes it directly to disk, which is common but should be used carefully to prevent resource exhaustion or unintended file writes. No suspicious or malicious code, such as network exfiltration, privilege escalation, or backdoors, is evident. The use of exception handling appears appropriate and limited to expected errors. Overall, the code appears standard with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code provides utility functions for handling HTTP errors, URL generation, parameter validation, and file download. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks beyond typical resource and input handling concerns. It appears to be safe and standard in functionality.",
