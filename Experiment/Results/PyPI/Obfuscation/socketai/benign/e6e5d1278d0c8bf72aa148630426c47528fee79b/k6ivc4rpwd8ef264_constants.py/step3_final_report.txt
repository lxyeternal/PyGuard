  "purpose": "Static assignment of URL path strings likely used for API or resource endpoints.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements where variables are set to string literals.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flow to external systems or outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static strings assigned to variables with no further processing.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names with no descriptive identifiers; no dynamic code or external calls.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string assignments to variables with obfuscated names, representing URL paths or resource identifiers. No dynamic input, external data, or executable code is present. The obfuscation of variable names may be an attempt to conceal purpose but does not indicate malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the benign, static nature of this code. Malware scores are appropriately zero; risk scores are low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal security concern. The high obfuscation score (~0.8) is justified given the variable naming style. Confidence levels are high (0.6-0.9), as the code is straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and obfuscated variable names alone do not suggest malicious intent. The current scores are consistent with the analysis, and no further action is necessary.",
