  "purpose": "Assigning string values representing resource and API endpoints to variables, possibly for API or resource referencing.",
  "sources": "Literal string assignments to variables.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks or data flow that could lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow observed; variables are assigned static strings without further processing.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names appear obfuscated or randomly generated, which is unusual but not inherently malicious; no sensitive data or credentials are hardcoded.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns static string paths to variables with non-descriptive, seemingly random names. There is no input/output handling, network communication, or data processing present. The variable names do not indicate malicious intent and could be part of obfuscated or auto-generated code. No suspicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors, is evident. The absence of dynamic execution, eval statements, or environment variable misuse reduces suspicion. Overall, this appears to be simple variable assignments with no malicious or security-related issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists of static string assignments with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided fragment.",
