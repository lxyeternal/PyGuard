  "purpose": "Tokenization and sentence splitting of a text paragraph using the ucto library.",
  "sources": "Input string 'hBXdClbqMzqBZhCLtbQcotxoOIQAKfHs' and a string parameter for tokenizer configuration.",
  "sinks": "Output printed to standard output via print() statements; no data leaks or external communication.",
  "flows": "Input data is processed by ucto.Tokenizer; tokens are iterated and printed; sentences are retrieved and printed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious functions detected. The code performs straightforward tokenization and printing.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'ucto' library and initializes a tokenizer with an English configuration. It processes a multi-line string to tokenize text into sentences, printing tokens with appropriate spacing and sentence breaks. Additional text is processed and sentences extracted for printing. No untrusted data input, external network communication, or malicious code execution is observed. The code appears to be a standard example of text tokenization without malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign demonstration of text tokenization using the 'ucto' library. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The script simply processes and outputs tokenized sentences.",
