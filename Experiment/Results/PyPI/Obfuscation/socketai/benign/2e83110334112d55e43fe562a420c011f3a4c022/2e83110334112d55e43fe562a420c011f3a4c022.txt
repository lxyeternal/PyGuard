      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate build configuration script with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious activity or malware. The main concern is the potential manipulation via environment variables, which is common but should be monitored. The malware score is justified as 0, obfuscation is moderate to high (around 0.6), and overall security risk is low (around 0.2)."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign NLP tokenization script with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks. The obfuscation does not impact security but slightly reduces code clarity. Overall, it is a safe and standard implementation."
