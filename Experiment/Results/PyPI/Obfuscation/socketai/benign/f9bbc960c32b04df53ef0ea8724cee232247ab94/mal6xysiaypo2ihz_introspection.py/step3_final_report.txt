The use of string interpolation with parameters like 'table_name' and other identifiers introduces potential SQL injection vulnerabilities if inputs are untrusted. The obfuscated naming patterns suggest an attempt to conceal the code's intent or complexity, but no evidence of malicious payloads, network activity, or sabotage is present. The code is primarily read-only schema retrieval, with no signs of malware such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or destructive actions. The unsafe SQL practices are a concern but do not constitute active malicious behavior. The obfuscation level is high, which could be suspicious but not necessarily malicious.\\n\\nconclusion\": \"The code is a heavily obfuscated schema introspection utility for a Django Firebird backend. It does not exhibit malicious activity but employs unsafe SQL practices that could be exploited if inputs are not sanitized externally. There is no evidence of malware or sabotage, but the unsafe SQL concatenation poses a security risk in untrusted contexts.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.9,\n  \"obfuscated\": 0.8,\n  \"malware\": 0,\n  \"securityRisk\": 0.4\n}",
