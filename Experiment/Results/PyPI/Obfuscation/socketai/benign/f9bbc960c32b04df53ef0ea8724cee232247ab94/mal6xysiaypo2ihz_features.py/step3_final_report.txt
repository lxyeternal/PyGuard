  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user inputs, network connections, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), file reads.",
  "sinks": "Network transmissions, system commands, environment variables, file writes.",
  "flows": "Data read from sources, processed, potentially transmitted or executed.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation, dynamic eval/exec, suspicious strings, unvalidated inputs, hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits high obfuscation and dynamic execution patterns, which are common indicators of malicious intent. The presence of suspicious strings and unvalidated inputs further raises suspicion. No explicit malicious commands are confirmed, but the obfuscation and dynamic eval suggest potential concealment of malicious behavior. The lack of concrete evidence limits certainty, but the suspicion warrants cautious scoring.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, indicating a moderate to high potential for malicious behavior. The scores reflect this suspicion, with malware at 0.5, obfuscation at 0.8, and overall security risk at 0.6. These assessments are consistent with the observed patterns and reasoning.",
