  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a standard Python script or package component, but the specific intent cannot be determined without examining the actual code.",
  "sources": "Sources where code reads input or data include environment variables, user input functions, file reads, network requests, or external libraries that fetch data.",
  "sinks": "Sinks where untrusted data can lead to data leaks or effects include system commands execution, network transmissions, file writes, or database queries.",
  "flows": "Flow paths from sources to sinks would involve data being read from inputs and then processed or transmitted, possibly leading to malicious actions if untrusted data is mishandled.",
  "anomalies": "Anomalies to watch for include hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, unusual network activity, or code that performs system modifications without clear purpose.",
  "analysis": "Without the actual code content provided, a detailed step-by-step analysis cannot be performed. However, typical review involves checking for suspicious imports, dangerous function calls, hardcoded secrets, unusual control flows, and data handling routines. The absence of code details limits the ability to identify specific threats. A thorough review of the actual code snippets is necessary for precise evaluation.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of visible code and details, there are no clear signs of malicious behavior or security risks. However, without inspecting the actual code, the risk level cannot be definitively determined. The overall likelihood of malicious intent appears low, but a proper review of the actual code is recommended.",
