  "purpose": "Define package metadata for distribution, including setup configuration and classifiers.",
  "sources": "Static data in variable definitions, input parameters to setup() function.",
  "targets": "No clear data sinks that process untrusted input; setup parameters are static.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; setup parameters are hardcoded.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names, which may be intended to conceal intent, but no malicious actions observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup from distutils.core and defines metadata variables with obfuscated names. The setup() function is called with parameters, some of which are hardcoded and obfuscated, but these are typical for package configuration. No user input, environment variables, or dynamic data are used. The variable names may raise suspicion, but the actual data and functions are standard for Python packaging. No code injection, network activity, or malicious logic is present. The obfuscated variable names could be an attempt to hide the purpose, but no malicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard Python package setup script with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The obfuscation may be for obfuscation's sake or to hinder easy understanding but does not indicate malicious intent.",
