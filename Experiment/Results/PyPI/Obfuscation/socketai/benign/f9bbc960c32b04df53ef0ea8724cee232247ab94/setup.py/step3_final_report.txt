  "purpose": "Package setup script defining metadata with obfuscated variable names.",
  "sources": "Static variables containing package classifiers, license, dependencies, and version information.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or external data flow; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "N/A – static data assigned to setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names that do not affect functionality but hinder readability.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package setup script, with obfuscated variable names serving as metadata parameters. No dynamic code, network activity, or external input is present. The obfuscation appears to be for concealment, not malicious intent. All security signals indicate benign behavior, with no signs of malware or vulnerabilities. The malware score is correctly set to 0, and the low risk score reflects the static, safe nature of the code. The obfuscation score is high due to nonsensical variable names, but this alone does not imply malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated package setup script with no malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation is superficial and does not constitute a security threat. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and no further action is necessary.",
  "model": "gpt-4.1-nano"
