  "purpose": "To define and configure the setup parameters for a Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The 'setup' function call and the variables containing metadata (e.g., license, version, classifiers, install_requires).",
  "sinks": "The 'setup' function call, which uses the provided metadata and dependencies to build or distribute the package.",
  "flows": "Metadata variables are passed directly into the setup() function, forming the configuration for package distribution.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names ('bxcRWljKHIsNAMoptjYWcGkcMImrMIiD', 'sOubuOenXQLxlHxBsSoiahOKeSgsYHLs') and nonsensical variable assignments; no actual malicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setup' from 'distutils.core' and defines several variables with obfuscated names holding package metadata such as classifiers, license, version, and dependencies. These variables are passed into the setup() function to configure package distribution. The obfuscated variable names serve no apparent purpose other than obfuscation; the code lacks any dynamic code execution, data exfiltration, network activity, or malicious logic. All operations appear to be standard package configuration steps with intentionally obscure variable names, possibly to evade simple static detection. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names, likely for concealment but containing no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a normal package configuration file with no indications of malware or supply chain attacks.",
