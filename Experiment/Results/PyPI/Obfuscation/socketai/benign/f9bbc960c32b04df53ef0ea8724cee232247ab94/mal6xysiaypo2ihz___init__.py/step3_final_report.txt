{
  "purpose": "To assess supply chain security risks in the open source Python dependency by analyzing code snippets for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security issues.",
  "sources": "Code imports, data flow from sources to sinks, input handling, environment variables, network connections, file operations.",
  "sinks": "Network transmissions, file modifications, environment variable access, data leaks, system modifications.",
  "flows": "Sources to sinks via function calls, data processing, or network communication pathways.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, suspicious network domains, obfuscated code, unusual data handling, hidden backdoors, dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate minimal or benign code with no suspicious patterns. Malware scores are consistently 0, reflecting no malicious activity. Risk scores are low (0.1-0.2), justified by the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior. Confidence levels range from 0.3 to 0.9, appropriate given the limited context. No anomalies or obfuscation are observed. The reasoning across reports is consistent and cautious, aligning with the evidence provided.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary; the environment is considered low risk based on current information.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
