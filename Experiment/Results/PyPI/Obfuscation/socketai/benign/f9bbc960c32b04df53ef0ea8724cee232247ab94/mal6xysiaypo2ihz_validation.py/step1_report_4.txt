{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script, likely intended for data processing or utility functions. There is no immediately obvious malicious intent or hidden backdoor.",
  "sources": "Reads data from standard input, local files, or environment variables (if present in the code).",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes data to files, prints output, or makes network requests (if present).",
  "flows": "Data is read from sources and processed through functions, with outputs directed to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious imports, or obfuscated code detected. No unusual behavior observed in the provided code.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward and employs standard Python constructs. There are no signs of malicious payloads such as network connections to suspicious domains, code injection, or backdoors. The use of third-party libraries is typical, with no evidence of malicious use. The code does not contain any obfuscated segments or hidden payloads. Data handling appears normal, with no leakage of sensitive information. No hardcoded secrets or environment variable misuse are detected.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code fragment, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears safe and standard for typical Python applications. However, this analysis is limited to the code shown and does not account for external dependencies or runtime behavior.",
