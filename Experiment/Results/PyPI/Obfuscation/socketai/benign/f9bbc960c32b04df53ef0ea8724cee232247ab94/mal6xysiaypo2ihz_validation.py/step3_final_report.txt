  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code input, external libraries, environment variables, network calls, hardcoded secrets.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission, file system modifications, environment variable access, system commands.",
  "flows": "Input sources (e.g., user input, environment variables) to sinks (e.g., network, file system).",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation (0.7), complex code structures, suspicious import patterns, unusual runtime behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits significant obfuscation with a score of 0.7, indicating concealment tactics. No explicit malicious activity such as network exfiltration, system damage, or backdoors is evident. The low malware score (0.2) aligns with the absence of concrete malicious indicators. The benign code structure and lack of suspicious patterns support a low security risk score (0.2). The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not confirm malicious intent. The overall assessment suggests a low likelihood of malware, with obfuscation being the primary concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily obfuscated but does not demonstrate definitive malicious behavior. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware likelihood remains low. The security risk is moderate due to obfuscation but no active threats are identified. Continued monitoring and dynamic analysis are recommended for obfuscated segments.",
