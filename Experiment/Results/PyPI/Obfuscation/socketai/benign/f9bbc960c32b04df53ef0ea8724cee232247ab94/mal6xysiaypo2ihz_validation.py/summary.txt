  "conclusion": "The code is primarily obfuscated but does not demonstrate definitive malicious behavior. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware likelihood remains low. The security risk is moderate due to obfuscation but no active threats are identified. Continued monitoring and dynamic analysis are recommended for obfuscated segments."
