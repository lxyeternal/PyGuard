  "purpose": "OAuth2 token management client for Keycloak with embedded credentials and obfuscated variable names.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded secrets ('password', 'api-client', 'yxmZymjyMufQgbeNOXvLHv68JOsbaog1') within class attributes; network responses for token exchange.",
  "sinks": "Requests to token endpoint; storage of tokens; usage of tokens in headers for authenticated requests.",
  "flows": "Credentials used to request tokens; tokens stored with expiry timestamps; tokens used for authorization headers.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation of variable and class names; embedded secrets; no malicious code observed but security risks present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements OAuth2 token retrieval and management, with hardcoded credentials and obfuscated identifiers. No malicious payloads or network behaviors indicative of malware are present. The obfuscation and embedded secrets pose security risks but do not constitute malicious activity. The code follows standard OAuth2 flows, and the obfuscation appears intentional, likely for concealment rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard OAuth2 client with insecure practices such as hardcoded secrets and obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain malware. The primary concern is security hygiene rather than malicious sabotage.",
