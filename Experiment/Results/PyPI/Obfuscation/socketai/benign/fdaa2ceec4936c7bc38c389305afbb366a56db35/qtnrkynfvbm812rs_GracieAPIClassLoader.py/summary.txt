  "conclusion": "The code pattern is inherently risky due to dynamic imports based on external, unvalidated inputs. While no explicit malware or malicious payloads are present, the potential for exploitation exists if inputs are manipulated. The obfuscation and dynamic nature warrant a high security risk score, and caution should be exercised when deploying such code without proper validation and sandboxing."
