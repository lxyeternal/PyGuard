  "purpose": "API wrapper class managing directory watch operations via external API calls, passing parameters like dirWatchId and projectId.",
  "sources": "Method parameters such as dirWatchId, projectId, subDir, isRunning, and other locals used in delegated API calls.",
  "sinks": "External method calls (DbjnoXWevXQAQiPesozUYLCTcNzhHUkE and TkpvQCFmpwLlBnhUbxaPDcUUmUUxDiDb) where data is passed for execution.",
  "flows": "Data flows from method parameters into local variables, then into delegated API methods which perform network requests.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of class and variable names; no explicit input validation or hardcoded secrets; no malicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard API client wrapper with obfuscated identifiers. It delegates requests to external methods, likely for directory watch management. No signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration. Obfuscation is high but appears intentional for proprietary reasons. No network or system compromise indicators are present. The delegation pattern and lack of malicious code suggest legitimate functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, albeit obfuscated, API client wrapper for directory watch management. No malicious activity or malware is detected. The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not imply malicious intent. The security risk is low, and the malware score should remain at 0.",
