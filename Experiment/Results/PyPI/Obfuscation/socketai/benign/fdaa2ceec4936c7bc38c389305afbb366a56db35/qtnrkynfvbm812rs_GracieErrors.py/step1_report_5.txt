{
  "purpose": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes, likely for handling specific error conditions in a larger application.",
  "sources": "The only source of data is the hard-coded string 'feeds' assigned to the variable jOprpphXdrAmcvTWDbcjDXPZwUSjeSTB.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this code snippet; there are no operations that process or output data, especially untrusted input.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code solely declares exception classes and assigns a constant string.",
  "anomalies": "All classes are custom exceptions with similar structure, no suspicious or malicious code behavior. The variable name is obfuscated but appears to be a static string assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code creates several custom exception classes with non-descriptive, obfuscated names, which might suggest an attempt to conceal intent. However, these classes are standard in structure and do not contain any logic other than storing and representing error messages. The only data variable is a string 'feeds' assigned to an obfuscated variable, with no further usage or processing. There are no network operations, file handling, code execution, or data exfiltration mechanisms present. The code appears to be benign and serves as a foundation for error handling within a larger codebase. The obfuscated variable name could be an attempt to hide some intent, but with no active logic or data handling, it is not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of custom exception class definitions and a single string variable assignment. There is no evidence of malicious intent, data leakage, or suspicious behavior. The obfuscated variable name alone is insufficient to indicate malicious activity without additional context.",
