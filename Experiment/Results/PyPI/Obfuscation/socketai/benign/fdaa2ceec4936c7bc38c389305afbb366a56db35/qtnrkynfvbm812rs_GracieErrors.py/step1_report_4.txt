{
  "purpose": "Defines multiple custom exception classes with identical structure, possibly for use in larger application.",
  "sources": "No external input reading or data input in this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink pathways are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions with no logic, data handling, or dynamic code execution. The variable 'jOprpphXdrAmcvTWDbcjDXPZwUSjeSTB' is defined but unused, and all classes are standard exception subclasses with no malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code only defines several custom exception classes that inherit from Python's Exception. Each class has an __init__ method storing a message and args, and a __str__ method returning a string representation of the message. There are no suspicious behaviors such as network activity, data theft, code injection, or obfuscation. No sources or sinks are present, and the code appears to be purely structural, likely part of a larger application. The variable at the start is unused and appears to be obfuscated or auto-generated, but this alone does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of exception class definitions with no malicious behavior or security issues. It does not contain any suspicious or malicious activity within its scope.",
