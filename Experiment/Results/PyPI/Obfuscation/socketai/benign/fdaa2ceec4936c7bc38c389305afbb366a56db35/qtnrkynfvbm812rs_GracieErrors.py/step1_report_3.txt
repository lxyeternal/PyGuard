  "purpose": "Define multiple custom exception classes with identical structure for handling specific error conditions.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data transmission observed.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "Use of numerous custom exception classes with identical implementation; no apparent functional purpose or variable secrets; the initial variable assignment appears arbitrary.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class definitions for custom exceptions, all following the same pattern. No data input, output, or network activity is present. The initial variable assignment appears as a random string, but without further context, it does not suggest malicious intent. The code does not perform any operations beyond class declarations. The repetitive pattern and lack of meaningful logic imply no malicious behavior or security risks. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to serve as a placeholder or boilerplate for exception handling without any malicious or suspicious functionality. It does not pose security risks based on the provided fragment.",
