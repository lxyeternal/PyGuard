{
  "purpose": "To evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on supply chain threats, suspicious patterns, and anomalies.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include environment variables, imported libraries, and data handling functions within the code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file system modifications, environment variable access, and data leaks or exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or inputs through the code logic to sinks like network transmissions or file writes, which could be exploited maliciously.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears benign with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The provided code snippets are either missing or benign, with no evidence of malicious patterns, obfuscation, or security flaws. The scores assigned across reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the absence of suspicious activity. Confidence levels are appropriate given the limited or incomplete code context. No anomalies or malicious indicators are present, and the overall assessment aligns with the evidence.",
  "conclusion": "All reports correctly identify the lack of malicious or suspicious code. The low risk and malware scores are justified, and confidence levels are appropriate. No further action or score adjustments are necessary based on the current information.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.2,
