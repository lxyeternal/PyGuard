  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or system interaction, but without seeing the actual code, this cannot be definitively determined.",
  "sources": "The code likely reads data from input functions, environment variables, or imported modules, but specific sources cannot be identified without the actual code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, file writes, or execution of dynamic code, but details are unavailable without the code content.",
  "flows": "Flow details depend on actual code logic; typically from data sources to processing functions to sinks, but cannot be confirmed here.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies can be identified without the code. Watch for hardcoded credentials, unusual imports, or suspicious function calls.",
  "analysis": "Insufficient information to perform a step-by-step analysis. Cannot determine sources, sinks, flows, or anomalies without the code content.",
  "conclusion": "Due to the absence of actual code, a thorough security assessment is not possible. No definitive malicious behavior or security risks can be identified at this time.",
