  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes inheriting from built-in exception types.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from TypeError.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; classes are for exception handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; classes only define hierarchy.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual class names and inheritance pattern, but no malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three classes with complex, seemingly random names. All inherit from built-in exception types, specifically TypeError. There are no functions, data processing, or external inputs. The classes are empty and do not perform any operations. The naming pattern appears obfuscated or auto-generated but does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or code injection present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to only define custom exception classes with obscure names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It seems intended for obfuscation or to complicate reverse engineering but lacks malicious intent.",
