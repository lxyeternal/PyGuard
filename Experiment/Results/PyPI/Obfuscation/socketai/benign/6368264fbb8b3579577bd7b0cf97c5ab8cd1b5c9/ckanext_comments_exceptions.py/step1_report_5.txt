{
  "purpose": "Defines three custom exception classes, one inheriting directly from TypeError and two inheriting from the first custom class.",
  "sources": "Class definitions that do not read external input or data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; only class inheritance structures are present.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual class names that appear obfuscated or nonsensical, possibly used to hide malicious intent. No functional behavior or logic is present.",
  "analysis": "The code creates three classes with obfuscated, non-descriptive names. One class inherits from TypeError, indicating custom exception handling, and the other two inherit from the first class, establishing a hierarchy. There are no functions, no data processing, no I/O operations. The naming patterns suggest potential obfuscation to hide malicious purpose, but there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior. The structure is minimal, indicating the code could be used as a component in a larger, possibly malicious, system.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily establishes obfuscated class hierarchies without any operational logic. While the class names are suspicious, there is no explicit malicious activity or security risk within this fragment alone. It could be part of a larger malicious payload, but this snippet by itself appears benign.",
