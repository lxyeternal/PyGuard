{
  "purpose": "The code defines three custom exception classes, inheriting from built-in exception types.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and inheritance declarations.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or external data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths present.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual class names that resemble obfuscated or intentionally complex identifiers, but no functional anomalies or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class declarations for exceptions with complex, non-descriptive names. These classes inherit from Python's TypeError and each other, but there are no functions, no input handling, and no operations that could lead to security issues. The naming may suggest obfuscation or an attempt to hide intent, but structurally, this is typical class inheritance syntax. No signs of malicious activity such as network calls, data exfiltration, or code injection are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be harmless class definitions for custom exceptions with obfuscated names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based solely on these class declarations.",
