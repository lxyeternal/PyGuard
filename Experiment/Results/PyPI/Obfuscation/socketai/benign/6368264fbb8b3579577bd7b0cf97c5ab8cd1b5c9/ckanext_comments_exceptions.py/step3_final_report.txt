{
  "purpose": "The code defines three classes with obfuscated names, inheriting from exception types, with no methods or data handling, indicating benign class definitions.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and inheritance statements; no external input or data reading present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external interactions; no sinks identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; classes are inert with no executable code.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class names suggest obfuscation but no malicious code or behavior is present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class declarations with obfuscated names, inheriting from built-in exception types and a custom class. There are no methods, data processing, or external interactions. The obfuscation may be for concealment or auto-generation but does not imply malicious intent. No code execution, data leaks, or network activity are evident. The inheritance from exception classes and the lack of executable code indicate benign, structural class definitions. The obfuscation raises suspicion but is not sufficient to conclude malicious behavior without additional context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting of obfuscated class definitions with no malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation is notable but not indicative of malicious intent in isolation. The overall security risk is minimal.",
