  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling or categorization.",
  "sources": "Class definitions; no input or external data reading involved.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks or data leaks; no untrusted data processing or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths; classes are simply defined and not used.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual class names, possibly obfuscated or auto-generated, but no malicious actions detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of three class definitions, all inheriting from built-in or custom exception classes. No code execution, data handling, or suspicious behavior is present. The class names are unconventional and possibly obfuscated, but there are no signs of malicious intent such as network activity, data theft, or system manipulation. The structure is simple and does not include any executable or harmful code.",
  "conclusion": "This code defines three custom exception classes with obfuscated names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, likely part of larger, obscured codebase or auto-generated, but on its own, it poses no threat.",
