{
  "purpose": "Defines three subclasses, two inheriting from a custom class, and one inheriting from the built-in TypeError.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and inheritance declarations; no external input reading.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no external data handling or output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; no execution flow is observable beyond class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Class names are obfuscated and resemble random strings, but no code executes or performs suspicious actions. No hardcoded secrets, malicious functions, or code execution patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions with unconventional, seemingly random names. There are no methods, no data handling, and no external interactions. The inheritance from TypeError suggests an attempt to create custom exception classes, but this alone is not malicious. The obfuscated class names could be a simple attempt at code hiding or obfuscation, but without any executable content or malicious code, this appears benign. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data flows are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be harmless class definitions with obfuscated names, lacking any malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any actions, data processing, or external communications that would suggest malicious behavior.",
