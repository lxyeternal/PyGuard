  "purpose": "Setuptools setup configuration for a Python package, specifying message extractors.",
  "sources": "The code reads static configuration data within the setup() function call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code does not process user input or external data.",
  "flows": "The static configuration data is used directly in setup() without dynamic data flows.",
  "anomalies": "The 'message_extractors' parameter is a standard configuration option; no suspicious or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() with a configuration for message extractors, which is a common pattern for package localization and message handling. There are no signs of obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or malicious behavior. The configuration appears straightforward and typical for packaging purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration snippet with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It solely defines message extraction parameters for packaging.",
