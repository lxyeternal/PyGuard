  "purpose": "Data retrieval functions with obfuscated names accessing entities via external object methods.",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'id' passed directly to external object's get methods.",
  "sinks": "Potential data access points; no direct data leaks or malicious sinks evident.",
  "flows": "Input 'id' flows into external get methods; external object behavior unknown.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function and variable names; external object undefined; lack of input validation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of four simple wrapper functions with obfuscated identifiers, calling get methods on an external object whose origin is unknown. No malicious code, network activity, or data exfiltration is visible. The main concern is obfuscation and lack of context, which could hide malicious intent if the external object is compromised or malicious. The functions accept user-controlled 'id' parameters without validation, posing potential misuse risks. The scores assigned in reports (malware ~0.2, obfuscation ~0.8, risk ~0.3) are consistent with the suspicion raised by obfuscation but lack of concrete malicious activity. Overall, the code appears benign but suspicious due to obfuscation and missing context, warranting further investigation of the external dependency and input validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of obfuscated data access functions with no direct malicious activity detected. The obfuscation and undefined external object pose potential risks, but evidence of malware is lacking. Scores should reflect low malware probability (around 0.2), high obfuscation (around 0.8), and moderate security risk (around 0.3). Further analysis of the external object and broader context is recommended.",
