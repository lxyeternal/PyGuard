{
  "purpose": "The code sets up signal handlers for comment-related events, either using ckan.plugins.toolkit or blinker Namespace if the former is unavailable.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing ckan.plugins.toolkit or blinker; accessing signal methods; reading attribute 'signals' from toolkit or namespace",
  "sinks": "Calling signal() method on HVgajszciIwErjDPSYPzqZZOyCbqcYmX object to create signals for comment events",
  "flows": "Import ckan.plugins.toolkit → access signals or fallback to blinker Namespace → define signals for comments:created, comments:approved, comments:updated, comments:deleted",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names (e.g., HVgajszciIwErjDPSYPzqZZOyCbqcYmX, JABQNrQSnTYIiUepTKQNtMcBuGsBXecA, etc.), which may hinder code clarity but are not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets, external network calls, or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import a toolkit for managing signals. If unavailable, it falls back to blinker Namespace. It then creates four signals related to comment events. Variable names are deliberately obfuscated, which can be suspicious but may also be an obfuscation technique or code generated by an automated tool. No data leaks, network activity, or malicious behavior detected. No sensitive data handling or external calls are present. The purpose appears to be event signaling within a plugin or extension framework.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be standard event signaling setup with obfuscated variable names. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. The obfuscation is unusual but does not directly indicate malicious intent.",
