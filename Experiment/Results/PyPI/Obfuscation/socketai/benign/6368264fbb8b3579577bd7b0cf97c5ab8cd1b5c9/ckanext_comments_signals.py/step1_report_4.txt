{
  "purpose": "The code sets up signal handlers for comment-related events, likely for a plugin or application that tracks comments.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'ckan.plugins.toolkit' and 'blinker.Namespace'; access to 'tk.signals'; creation of signals for comment events.",
  "sinks": "Signals are used to emit events; potential for data flow if untrusted data is passed through signals, but no direct sinks for external data are evident.",
  "flows": "Import 'tk.signals' (source), create signals ('comments:created', etc.), potentially emitting or listening for signals (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names; conditional import with fallback; no direct use of untrusted data or malicious code. The code appears to be standard signal setup with no anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import 'ckan.plugins.toolkit' and access its 'signals' attribute. If AttributeError occurs, it falls back to importing 'Namespace' from 'blinker' and creating a new namespace for signals. It then defines four signals related to comment lifecycle events: created, approved, updated, and deleted. The variable names are obfuscated but do not indicate malicious intent. There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks, no code injection, data leakage, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code primarily sets up event signals, typical in plugin architectures.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup for event signaling, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscated variable names do not imply malicious intent but suggest code minimization or obfuscation. No malicious activity, data leakage, or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
