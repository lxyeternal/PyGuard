{
  "purpose": "Obfuscated implementation of bitwise operations, likely cryptographic or encoding routines, verified by extensive tests.",
  "sources": "Internal data within functions, no external data sources or inputs.",
  "sinks": "No external leaks, network activity, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows through functions via bitwise operations, with no external communication.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation, dynamic import handling, suspicious import path, nonsensical variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code performs XOR, AND, shifts, and additions on a custom type, resembling cryptographic primitives. Tests confirm correctness. No malicious payloads, network activity, or external data leaks are present. The import pattern and obfuscation suggest concealment but do not demonstrate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is an obfuscated cryptographic or data manipulation library with no evidence of malware or malicious activity. The high obfuscation is likely for concealment rather than malicious purpose.",
