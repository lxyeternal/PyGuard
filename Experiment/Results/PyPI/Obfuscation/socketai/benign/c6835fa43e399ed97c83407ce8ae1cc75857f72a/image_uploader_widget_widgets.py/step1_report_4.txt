  "purpose": "Custom widget class for image uploader in Django forms, extending ClearableFileInput with additional configuration and media assets.",
  "sources": "Configuration parameters in __init__ method, class attributes, and imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Super method calls, media assets inclusion, and property methods that access class attributes.",
  "flows": "Data flows from class attributes and method parameters into super() method and media property, with attribute access within custom methods.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated-looking class and method names, extensive attribute assignments with seemingly random names, and custom media inclusion. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious network calls are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of Django's ClearableFileInput widget with highly obfuscated class and attribute names. The constructor initializes several string attributes, likely used for configuration, without any hardcoded secrets or sensitive data. The method nDsQyyTdiYLyipVVvKuTNEVTFEXShCjt constructs a dictionary combining superclass data with custom display texts and icons, which are retrieved from the class attributes—these methods do not process untrusted input. The property wWqQlEbXklQvkhslJZZjSbVDhFynrXgl returns a Media object referencing JavaScript and CSS assets, consistent with Django static files usage. There are no network connections, data leaks, or suspicious behavior detected. The obfuscated names suggest either code minification or attempts to conceal intent, but nothing malicious is evident.\n\nOverall, the code appears to implement a standard custom widget with obfuscated naming but no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a custom Django form widget class with obfuscated naming but no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It only manages media assets and configuration attributes for an image uploader. No malicious or harmful behavior is detected.",
