  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the code's behavior, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code defines a Django widget subclassing `ClearableFileInput`.\n- The class and method names are highly obfuscated, with nonsensical strings.\n- The code sets attributes related to templates, media files (JS and CSS), and display labels/icons.\n- No network activity, data leaks, or dynamic code execution is evident.\n- The attributes are static or passed during initialization; no untrusted input is directly used in dangerous operations.\n- The obfuscation could be an attempt to hide malicious intent, but there's no concrete evidence of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Standard custom image upload widget.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, standard Django practices.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1\n- **Conclusion:** Valid, well-structured, benign.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar widget with obfuscated names.\n- **Analysis:** Obfuscation is higher; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0.8, Risk = 0.2\n- **Justification:** Obfuscation is high, but absence of malicious behavior justifies a low malware score.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Again, a heavily obfuscated widget.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity; obfuscation is high.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0.75, Risk = 0.2\n- **Justification:** Same reasoning as above.\n\n**Verdict:** Acceptable scores.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Obfuscated widget with no malicious activity.\n- **Analysis:** Obfuscation high, but no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0.8, Risk = 0.2\n- **Justification:** Consistent with previous assessments.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Obfuscated widget, no malicious activity.\n- **Analysis:** Same as above.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0.7, Risk = 0.2\n- **Justification:** No evidence of malicious activity; obfuscation remains high.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** High across reports, consistent with the obfuscated naming.\n- **Risk Score:** Low (0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal security risk based on the code.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n- The obfuscation is suspicious but not malicious. It could be a minification or intentional concealment.\n- No signs of supply chain compromise, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n- The code appears to be a standard custom widget with obfuscated identifiers.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.75 (due to the nonsensical, obfuscated names)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (minimal security risk, primarily due to obfuscation)\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:** The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the code's behavior. No adjustments are necessary unless further context reveals malicious intent.",
