{
  "purpose": "A custom Django widget for image uploading with heavily obfuscated class and method names, designed to integrate specific media and template configurations.",
  "sources": "Initialization parameters setting class attributes; media files included via property; configuration dictionary assembled in method.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network calls, data leaks, or code execution paths observed.",
  "flows": "Initialization assigns parameters to class attributes; configuration method merges superclass data with widget labels/icons; media property loads JS/CSS files.",
  "anomalies": "Excessive obfuscation of class, method, and attribute names; nonsensical string literals; no comments or documentation; potential red flag for concealment.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of Django's ClearableFileInput with obfuscated naming conventions. It sets template and media resources, and provides methods to generate configuration data for the widget, including labels and icons. No network activity, data exfiltration, or dynamic code execution is evident. The obfuscation may be an attempt to hide malicious intent, but no malicious behavior or vulnerabilities are detected. The code appears to be a standard custom widget implementation, just with intentionally confusing identifiers. The high obfuscation score is justified, but the malware score remains zero due to lack of malicious activity. The overall security risk is low, primarily due to obfuscation, but without evidence of malicious payloads or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated but benign Django widget implementation. Despite the obfuscation, there is no current evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The high obfuscation score reflects the confusing naming, but the malware score remains zero, and the overall security risk is low. Continuous source verification is recommended if used in supply chain contexts.",
