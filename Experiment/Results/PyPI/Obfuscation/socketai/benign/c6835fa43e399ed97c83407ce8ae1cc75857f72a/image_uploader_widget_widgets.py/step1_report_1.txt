{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom Django form widget for image uploading, including HTML template, JavaScript, and CSS assets.",
  "sources": "Input sources are the widget's constructor parameters and form data, particularly the HTML template and attributes passed during instantiation.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the rendering of media assets and the dynamic generation of attributes for the widget; however, no untrusted data is directly used in these operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (e.g., HTML template, CSS/JS asset references) through widget initialization to the rendering of media assets; no malicious data flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior detected. The class and method structures are standard for Django widget customization. No obfuscated code or suspicious variable names indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a custom Django widget subclassing ClearableFileInput, with custom HTML template and associated media files (JavaScript and CSS). The constructor allows customization via parameters, which are assigned to class attributes. The method nDsQyyTdiYLyipVVvKuTNEVTFEXShCjt constructs a dictionary combining super()'s returned dictionary with custom labels and icons. The property wWqQlEbXklQvkhslJZZjSbVDhFynrXgl returns a Media object referencing specific JS and CSS files. All operations appear standard for a Django widget customization, with no signs of data leakage, code injection, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical implementation of a Django custom file upload widget with configurable labels and assets. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity detected. The code is well-structured and leverages standard Django features without obfuscation or malicious intent.",
