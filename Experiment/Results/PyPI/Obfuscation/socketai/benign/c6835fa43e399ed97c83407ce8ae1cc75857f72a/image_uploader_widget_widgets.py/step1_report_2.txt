  "purpose": "Custom widget for image upload in Django forms with configurable attributes and media files.",
  "sources": "Initialization parameters in __init__, property wWqQlEbXklQvkhslJZZjSbVDhFynrXgl, and imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Superclass constructor, returning media assets, and dynamic attribute access methods.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into class attributes during initialization, used in methods that generate widget attributes and media assets.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated, nonsensical class and method names; all attribute names are random strings, which may indicate obfuscation. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom Django widget subclassing ClearableFileInput with obfuscated class and method names. The __init__ method sets attributes based on parameters, and several accessor methods return attribute values. The nDsQyyTdiYLyipVVvKuTNEVTFEXShCjt method constructs a dictionary combining superclass data with custom widget attributes, including localized labels and icons. The wWqQlEbXklQvkhslJZZjSbVDhFynrXgl property specifies media files (JS and CSS) for the widget. All code appears to be legitimate widget setup code, with no network communication, data leakage, or suspicious operations. The obfuscation of names could be a sign of attempts to hide malicious intent, but no malicious behaviors or payloads are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a highly obfuscated Django form widget with no apparent malicious behavior or security risks. Its purpose appears to be creating a customizable image upload widget with associated media assets. The obfuscation could be a red flag, but there is no evidence of malicious intent or supply chain compromise within this fragment.",
