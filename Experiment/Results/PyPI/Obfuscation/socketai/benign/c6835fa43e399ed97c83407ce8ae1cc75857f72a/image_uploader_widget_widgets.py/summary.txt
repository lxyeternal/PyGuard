  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated but benign Django widget implementation. Despite the obfuscation, there is no current evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The high obfuscation score reflects the confusing naming, but the malware score remains zero, and the overall security risk is low. Continuous source verification is recommended if used in supply chain contexts."
