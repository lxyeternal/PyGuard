  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or output operations are present",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the import is static",
  "anomalies": "The imported symbol has an obfuscated or random name, which may be suspicious, but this alone is not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple import from a relative module and defines an __all__ list for exports. The imported symbol name appears obfuscated or randomly generated, which can be a red flag for obfuscation or hiding malicious intent. However, there are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activities. The code is minimal and appears legitimate, albeit with suspicious naming.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal module that imports a symbol with an obfuscated name and defines an export list. No malicious activity is evident; the obfuscated import may be a red flag but is not conclusive of malicious intent. Overall, it appears benign but suspicious due to the naming.",
