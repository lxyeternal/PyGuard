  "purpose": "Import a symbol with an obfuscated name from a local module and export 'ImageListField'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .fields module, reading the symbol 'ehkeqRdvLcqmOFoOegLsKfyPFUgwhFjJ'.",
  "sinks": "None; no data or untrusted input flows to any sink or external system.",
  "flows": "Import source to symbol usage (though symbol is not used further in this snippet).",
  "anomalies": "Use of an obfuscated symbol name 'ehkeqRdvLcqmOFoOegLsKfyPFUgwhFjJ', which could indicate obfuscation or concealment.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple import of an obfuscated symbol from a local module and declares an export list. No malicious code, network activity, or data leaks are present. The obfuscated name raises suspicion but does not constitute malicious behavior on its own. The import is syntactically correct, and the symbol is not used further in this snippet, which is typical for module interface definitions. The scores from the reports correctly reflect the lack of malicious activity but acknowledge the suspicious obfuscation. Given the minimal code and absence of malicious indicators, the overall security risk is low. The malware score should be 0, as there is no evidence of malicious intent, and the obfuscation suspicion should be noted but not overstate risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign but uses an obfuscated symbol name, which warrants further review of the 'fields' module. No evidence of malicious activity is present. The scores should reflect a malware score of 0, high obfuscation suspicion, and low security risk.",
