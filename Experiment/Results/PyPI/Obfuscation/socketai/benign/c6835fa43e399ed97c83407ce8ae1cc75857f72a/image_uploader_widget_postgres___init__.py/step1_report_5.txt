  "purpose": "Import a specific object from a local module and define an export list for the module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module (.fields).",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data could cause security issues.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports and exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "The imported symbol 'ehkeqRdvLcqmOFoOegLsKfyPFUgwhFjJ' appears to be an obfuscated or nonsensical identifier, which is unusual. This could indicate an attempt to hide malicious intent or code obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a symbol with an obfuscated name from a local module, then defines a public interface with a known name. The use of an obfuscated import name is suspicious, as it might be used to hide malicious code or backdoors. However, there are no direct malicious actions such as network access, data manipulation, or malicious logic present in this snippet. The code structure is simple, but the obfuscated import raises concern about hidden intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself is minimal and does not execute any malicious actions directly. The obfuscated import suggests potential concealment or malicious intent, warranting further investigation of the 'fields' module. Overall, the risk appears low but the obfuscation is suspicious.",
