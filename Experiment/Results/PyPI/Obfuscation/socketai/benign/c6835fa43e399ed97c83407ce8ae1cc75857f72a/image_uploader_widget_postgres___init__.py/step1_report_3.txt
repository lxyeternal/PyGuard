  "purpose": "Import a specific object from a local module and define an exported list for module interface.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'ehkeqRdvLcqmOFoOegLsKfyPFUgwhFjJ' from a relative module '.fields'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; no data leaks or effects detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the import source to the namespace; no further data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "The imported object name 'ehkeqRdvLcqmOFoOegLsKfyPFUgwhFjJ' appears to be an obfuscated or randomly generated identifier, which may be unusual or suspicious. The rest of the code is standard and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a single item from a local module, which could be legitimate or obfuscated. The '__all__' list specifies 'ImageListField' for public API. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as hardcoded credentials, code injection, or network activity. The obfuscated import name may suggest attempts to hide or evade detection but could also be part of standard obfuscation or code generation practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal and appears to be a straightforward module import with an export list. The obfuscated import name warrants caution but does not necessarily indicate malicious intent. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident from this snippet.",
