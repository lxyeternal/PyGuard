  "purpose": "Importing a specific attribute from a local module named 'fields' and defining an export list for the module.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'ehkeqRdvLcqmOFoOegLsKfyPFUgwhFjJ' from the local 'fields' module.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external connections present.",
  "flows": "Import statement loads code from 'fields'; no data flow leading to external systems or insecure operations.",
  "anomalies": "The imported attribute 'ehkeqRdvLcqmOFoOegLsKfyPFUgwhFjJ' appears to be an obfuscated or randomly generated name, which is unusual and potentially suspicious. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple import from a local module, which is standard. The exported attribute 'ImageListField' is declared for module exports. The imported attribute has an obfuscated or random name, which may suggest intentional concealment or obfuscation, though this alone does not indicate malicious behavior. There are no apparent malicious actions, data leaks, or external communications. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no evident malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal import statement with an obfuscated attribute name. There are no malicious behaviors or security risks evident. The obfuscated import name warrants attention but does not imply malicious activity in itself.",
