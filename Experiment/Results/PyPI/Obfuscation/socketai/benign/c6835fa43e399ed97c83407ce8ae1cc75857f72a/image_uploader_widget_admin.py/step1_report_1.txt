{
  "purpose": "Define custom Django admin inline classes with specific widget and media configurations for image uploaders.",
  "sources": "Class attribute assignments, method return statements, and property methods that access class attributes.",
  "sinks": "Super calls to parent class methods, return statements, property methods returning media objects.",
  "flows": "Class attribute values (potential input sources) are accessed and used in methods that modify or return media and request handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains highly obfuscated class and attribute names, but no evidence of malicious code, external network calls, or data leaks. The class methods and properties are used to configure media assets (JS and CSS) for widgets. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two Django inline classes with custom widget HTML templates and media files. The attribute names are intentionally obfuscated, but they only reference local media files and templates. The methods and property functions appear to simply return configured media assets or class attributes. Super calls invoke parent class methods for request and object handling, typical in Django admin customizations. No external network activity, data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. Obfuscation seems purely stylistic or to hinder readability, not indicative of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate attempt to customize Django admin inline classes with specific media assets and templates. Despite obfuscated naming, there are no signs of malware, malicious backdoors, or security threats. The code is consistent with standard Django practices for admin customization.",
