  "purpose": "A custom Django widget for handling image uploads, URL retrieval, and rendering media assets within forms.",
  "sources": "File input fields, form data dictionaries, and storage URL functions.",
  "sinks": "URL generation via default_storage.url(), form widget rendering, and media inclusion in frontend.",
  "flows": "Input data from form submissions or files -> processing functions (e.g., URL retrieval, form data handling) -> widget rendering and media output.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and method names, but no malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a Django widget subclass managing image uploads with standard API usage. Obfuscated naming suggests concealment but does not imply malicious intent. No external network calls or data exfiltration observed. The functions handle URL generation, form data processing, and media rendering securely. The obfuscation score is high due to naming but does not correlate with malicious behavior. Malware risk is zero, and overall security risk is low (~0.2).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, obfuscated Django widget for image uploads with no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. Obfuscation is notable but not malicious. The malware score remains 0, with a high obfuscation score (~0.8), and a low security risk (~0.2). No further action required unless new suspicious activity emerges.",
