The high obfuscation score reflects the confusing naming, but the malware score remains zero, and the overall security risk is low. Continuous source verification is recommended if used in supply chain contexts."

The high obfuscation warrants cautious deployment but does not imply malicious intent. The malware score is appropriately zero, and the overall security risk is low."
