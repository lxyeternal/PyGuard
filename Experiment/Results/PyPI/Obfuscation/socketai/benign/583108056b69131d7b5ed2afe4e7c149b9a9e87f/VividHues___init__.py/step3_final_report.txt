{
  "purpose": "The code provides stylized terminal output functions, including color manipulation and decorative info display, primarily for aesthetic and branding purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads static class attributes, string literals, and parameters; notably uses 'os.system(\"\")' which executes nothing.",
  "sinks": "String concatenations, print statements, and sys.stdout.write; no external data or network activity involved.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into styling functions, with static class attributes providing color codes; no external data flow or system modifications.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of 'os.system(\"\")' calls, which are no-ops but suspicious; heavily obfuscated variable names and dynamic string assembly for styling, not malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a heavily obfuscated utility for colored terminal output, with static metadata and functions for generating stylized strings. The 'os.system(\"\")' calls are suspicious but do nothing harmful. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are evident. Obfuscation appears aesthetic, not malicious. The code's primary purpose is styling and branding, with no malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a stylized terminal utility. The 'os.system(\"\")' calls are harmless placeholders or obfuscation tactics. No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious activity. The current malware score should remain at 0, with a low security risk (~0.2) due to the suspicious but harmless system calls. The obfuscation level is moderate but consistent with aesthetic intent.",
