  "purpose": "Configuration functions for Jupyter Notebook extensions, importing from local modules with obfuscated names.",
  "sources": "The functions return static dictionaries; no untrusted data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or external communications; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "Functions provide static data without dynamic or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated module and variable names, which could be stylistic or due to obfuscation tools.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of import statements with obfuscated identifiers and two functions returning static configuration dictionaries. There is no evidence of dynamic data handling, user input processing, network activity, or malicious behavior. The obfuscation of names raises suspicion but does not constitute malicious intent without further context. The code is static and serves configuration purposes, with no active malicious operations or data leaks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware score 0, low security risk, moderate obfuscation) are consistent with this analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a static configuration script for Jupyter Notebook extensions. The obfuscation alone does not indicate malicious activity. No evidence of malware or security vulnerabilities is present. The low malware and security risk scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.",
