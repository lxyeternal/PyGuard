{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define functions for Jupyter Notebook extensions, likely related to widget integration and extension registration.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.widget, .html, ._version); functions that return configuration dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted input; functions return static configuration data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external input to sensitive functions or data leaks; the functions simply return predefined static data.",
  "anomalies": "The imported module names and functions use obfuscated or nonsensical identifiers, which is unusual and could suggest concealment or malicious intent. However, no hardcoded credentials, network operations, or suspicious behavior is present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports modules with obfuscated names, which could be a red flag but might also be a result of code obfuscation or code generation. The functions defined return static configuration data related to Jupyter Notebook extensions, which is typical for such setup scripts. There are no evident network operations, data leaks, or malicious payloads. The code's structure and content do not directly indicate malicious behavior, but the obfuscated identifiers warrant caution. Overall, the code seems to serve a legitimate purpose related to widget and extension configuration, with no active malicious actions or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard extension configuration script with obfuscated identifiers. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident from the code content itself. The obfuscation raises a minor concern, but based on the provided code, it does not appear malicious.",
