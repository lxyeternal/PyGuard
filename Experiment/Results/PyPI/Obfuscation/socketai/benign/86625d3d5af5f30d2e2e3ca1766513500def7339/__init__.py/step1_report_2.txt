{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define configuration functions for a Jupyter Notebook extension, specifically related to web GUI widgets and their loading procedures.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.widget, .html, ._version), which are likely part of the package itself. No external data sources or user inputs are evident.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks such as network calls, file writes, or system commands are present in the provided code.",
  "flows": "The functions return static configuration dictionaries that do not involve data flow from untrusted sources. No dynamic data flow is observed.",
  "anomalies": "Function and variable names are nonsensical and obfuscated, which could be an attempt to hide intent. The imported identifiers are cryptic, which might suggest obfuscation or malicious intent, but without further code or context, it cannot be definitively concluded.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily imports obfuscated modules and identifiers, then defines simple functions returning static configuration data for a Jupyter Notebook extension. No code executes external commands, network calls, or processes untrusted input. The obfuscated names may be suspicious but could also be an attempt at code compression or stylistic choice. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system manipulation are present in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The obfuscation of names raises suspicion but could be benign. The code's purpose seems to be static configuration for Jupyter extensions rather than malicious activity.",
