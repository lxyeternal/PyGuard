{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define functions related to Jupyter Notebook extensions, specifically for a web GUI widget integration.",
  "sources": "Reading module attributes, which are obfuscated variable names; no external input sources or untrusted data sources detected.",
  "sinks": "Return statements output configuration dictionaries, likely used for extension setup; no dangerous sinks or data leaks identified.",
  "flows": "Imports and variable definitions flow into functions that return static configuration objects; no data from untrusted sources flows into sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of heavily obfuscated variable names (e.g., kldGvBBBAFsiMReOofYsnbJPdDhqwMuS), which could suggest attempts to hide malicious intent, but no actual malicious behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules with obfuscated variable names, which might be suspicious, but these variables are only returned in static configuration objects. The functions simply provide configuration data for Jupyter Notebook extensions without processing external inputs or executing dynamic code. There are no indications of malicious code, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code injection. The obfuscation may be a style choice or an attempt to conceal trivial functionality, but no malicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily for registering or configuring Jupyter Notebook extensions. Despite obfuscated variable names, no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are apparent. It appears to be a benign configuration script.",
