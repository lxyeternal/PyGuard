{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define configuration functions for Jupyter Notebook extensions related to a widget and its HTML components.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.widget, .html, ._version); function return statements providing configuration dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "Return values of functions used for Jupyter extension configuration, which could potentially influence the extension setup but do not directly handle untrusted data or perform harmful actions.",
  "flows": "Imports -> Function definitions -> Return of static configuration dictionaries; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated-looking variable and function names; import statements with seemingly random module names; no visible use of user input or dynamic data. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific components from local modules, likely part of a larger package, with non-descriptive, obfuscated identifiers. It defines two functions returning static dictionaries for configuring Jupyter Notebook extensions. No data from external or untrusted sources is processed; no dynamic execution or code injection present. The structure is straightforward, serving configuration purposes, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation beyond variable naming.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign configuration script setting up Jupyter Notebook widget extensions. No malicious activity, data leakage, or security vulnerabilities are apparent. The obfuscated variable names are likely a code style choice or result of automated obfuscation but do not indicate malicious intent.",
