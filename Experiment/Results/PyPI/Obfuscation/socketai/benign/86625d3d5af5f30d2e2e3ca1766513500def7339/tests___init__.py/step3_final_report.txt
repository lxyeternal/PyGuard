  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code input, hardcoded strings, eval()/exec() calls, environment variables, network or file operations.",
  "sinks": "Data exfiltration points, network connections, file modifications, environment variable access, dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Input sources (e.g., user input, environment variables) to sinks like network transmission, file writes, or eval()/exec().",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval(), exec(), hardcoded credentials/URLs, obfuscation, suspicious imports, dynamic code execution, inconsistent formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code shows minimal suspicious features in some reports, notably eval() usage and obfuscation in Report 2, which justifies moderate suspicion. Most reports indicate benign, straightforward code with high confidence. The scores across reports are consistent with their descriptions, with Report 2 having higher obfuscation and potential risk. No confirmed malicious activity is identified, and the overall suspicion remains low. The scores are appropriately cautious, reflecting potential but unconfirmed threats.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency code appears largely benign with some reports indicating obfuscation and risky constructs. The scores are justified and aligned with the descriptions. No definitive malicious activity is detected, but vigilance is advised if suspicious patterns are confirmed in actual code review.",
