{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for encoding data, generating HTML templates, rendering web GUIs, and automating screenshots via Selenium. It appears designed for GUI rendering, testing, or visualization tasks.",
  "sources": "Reads external JavaScript files ('webgui.js'), JSON data, and HTML templates; accesses local files for HTML and JS content; loads web pages in Selenium WebDriver.",
  "sinks": "Embeds data and scripts into HTML, loads local files via Selenium, captures screenshots, and deletes temporary files.",
  "flows": "Data sources (JSON, external JS) are embedded into HTML templates, which are then loaded in Selenium WebDriver for rendering and screenshotting.",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic HTML and script injection based on external files and input data; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected; standard automation code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard GUI rendering and automation tasks with external resources. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The dynamic content generation could pose risks if inputs are untrusted, but no malicious intent is evident. The code is clear, with straightforward variable naming and no obfuscation. The use of Selenium for rendering and screenshotting is typical for testing or visualization purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for GUI rendering, testing, or automation. No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The moderate risk scores reflect potential misuse if inputs are untrusted but do not indicate active threats.",
