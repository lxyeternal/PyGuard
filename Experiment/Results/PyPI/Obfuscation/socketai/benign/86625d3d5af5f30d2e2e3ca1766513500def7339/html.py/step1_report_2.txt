{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for encoding numpy arrays, generating HTML templates for a web GUI, and automating screenshot capture of web content via Selenium.",
  "sources": "Reads JSON data, reads external JavaScript file ('webgui.js'), reads HTML template, and reads/writes files for HTML and JavaScript content.",
  "sinks": "Writes HTML content to files, writes screenshots to specified filenames, executes Selenium WebDriver commands, and loads external scripts.",
  "flows": "Input data (JSON) is encoded and embedded into HTML templates; JavaScript code is read and inserted into HTML; Selenium loads the generated HTML, captures screenshots, and deletes temporary files.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic file reading and writing of HTML/JS templates, potential manipulation of rendering parameters (e.g., 'preserveDrawingBuffer'), and execution of Selenium WebDriver in headless mode. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious hardcoded credentials observed. No obfuscated code detected. The use of temporary file creation and deletion is standard for automation but could be misused if hidden behind obfuscation, which is not present here.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to generate a web GUI page dynamically, embed JavaScript code, and control a browser session to capture a screenshot of a web page. It reads a JavaScript file, embeds it into an HTML template, and optionally modifies rendering options. The functions perform file I/O, JSON serialization, and browser automation. No indications of malicious network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. The code does not include any hardcoded credentials, reverse shells, or data leaks. The selenium automation is standard, used for capturing webpage screenshots. There is no obfuscated or suspicious logic; the code structure is clear and standard for such tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed for generating and capturing web content using Selenium. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are apparent. It performs legitimate automation tasks without signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
