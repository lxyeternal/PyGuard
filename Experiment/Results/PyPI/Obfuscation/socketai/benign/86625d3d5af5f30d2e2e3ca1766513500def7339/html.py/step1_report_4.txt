{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for encoding numpy array data, generating and modifying HTML templates, and capturing webpage screenshots using Selenium.",
  "sources": "Data is read from numpy arrays, JSON inputs, external JS files, and HTML files. External files are loaded from the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks via encoded data output, file writes, and browser automation for webpage rendering and screenshots.",
  "flows": "Data from numpy arrays or JSON is encoded or embedded into HTML templates. External JS is read from disk and inserted into HTML. Selenium loads local HTML files and captures screenshots.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names, dynamic HTML content generation, and the use of selenium for webpage rendering and screenshot capture. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles data encoding, HTML template creation, and webpage screenshot capturing. The encoding functions convert numpy arrays into base64 or binary formats. HTML templates are dynamically generated with embedded scripts, likely for visualization. The screenshot function writes HTML files, loads them in a headless browser, and captures images, then deletes temporary files. There are no suspicious data exfiltration or backdoor mechanisms, nor malicious payloads observed. The code appears benign, with functions aligned with data visualization and automation tasks. The use of selenium is for webpage rendering and screenshotting, not malicious activity. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate tasks related to data encoding, webpage rendering, and screenshot capturing. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malware are present. The use of selenium for automated webpage rendering and capturing is typical in testing or visualization workflows.",
