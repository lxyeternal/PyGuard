{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for encoding data, generating HTML templates, and rendering web GUI screenshots using Selenium.",
  "sources": "Reads external JavaScript file 'webgui.js', loads and processes data inputs (possibly from user or other code), reads environment variables (indirectly through filename), and loads system modules (os, time, selenium).",
  "sinks": "Writes HTML files to disk, executes Selenium WebDriver actions including loading URLs, taking screenshots, and removing temporary files.",
  "flows": "Input data (possibly untrusted) flows into encoding functions, which then encode and embed data into HTML templates. Selenium loads local HTML files and interacts with browser to generate screenshots. Files are read and written based on provided filenames.",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic HTML generation with embedded external JavaScript; use of selenium for automated browser control; no evident hardcoded secrets or credentials; code seems designed for rendering or testing GUIs. No obfuscated language features or misleading variables detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a utility suite for rendering a web GUI and capturing screenshots using Selenium. It loads external JavaScript code from a local file, embeds it into an HTML template, and uses headless Chrome to generate images. Data encoding functions convert data to base64 or binary formats for embedding or processing. The code handles file operations, external JavaScript loading, and browser automation. No suspicious network activity, credential theft, or malicious commands are present. There are no signs of malware or malicious behavior, and the code's purpose seems legitimate for automation or testing tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for GUI rendering and screenshot capture with no detected malicious intent. It operates within expected parameters for such tasks and does not exhibit malware or security risks.",
