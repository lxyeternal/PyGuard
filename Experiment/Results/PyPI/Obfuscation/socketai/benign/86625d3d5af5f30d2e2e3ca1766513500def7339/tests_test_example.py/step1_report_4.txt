  "flows": "Code creates ExampleWidget instance, then asserts property value matches expected string.",
  "anomalies": "Function name appears obfuscated or randomly generated; no other suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious actions detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward unit test using pytest to verify that an attribute of ExampleWidget equals 'Hello World'. The function name is unusual but not malicious. No input/output sources suggest external or malicious data flow. No suspicious code constructs, backdoors, or malicious network activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a simple unit test without any signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The unusual function name does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code appears benign.",
