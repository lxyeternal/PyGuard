  "purpose": "A simple pytest unit test that instantiates ExampleWidget and asserts its attribute equals 'Hello World'.",
  "sources": "Import statement and instantiation of ExampleWidget; reading the attribute RREUBZatdfGPyOQvhHFuOUHzkDowcrZX.",
  "sinks": "The assertion checks the attribute value; no external data leaks or network calls are present.",
  "flows": "Import -> instantiate ExampleWidget -> access attribute RREUBZatdfGPyOQvhHFuOUHzkDowcrZX -> assert equals 'Hello World'.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function name and attribute names; no malicious code or external data flows; no suspicious side effects.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured unit test with obfuscated identifiers. No malicious actions, network activity, or data leaks are evident. Obfuscation may be for proprietary reasons but does not imply malicious intent. The test performs a simple attribute check, and the absence of malicious code or external effects indicates benign behavior. The obfuscation raises suspicion but is not sufficient to classify as malicious. The malware score should remain at 0, and the security risk is minimal, around 0.1, primarily due to obfuscation. Confidence in benign nature is high (around 0.9).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated unit test with no signs of malware or security risks. The current scores are appropriate; the malware score remains at 0, and the security risk is very low. Obfuscation alone does not indicate malicious intent.",
