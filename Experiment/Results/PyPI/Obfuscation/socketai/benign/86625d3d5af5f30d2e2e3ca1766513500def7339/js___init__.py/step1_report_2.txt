{
  "purpose": "The code appears to read JavaScript files related to web GUI and Jupyter widgets, likely for use in a larger application.",
  "sources": "Reading files: open(__file__.replace('__init__.py', 'webgui.js')) and open(__file__.replace('__init__.py', 'webgui_jupyter_widgets.js'))",
  "sinks": "The contents of the JavaScript files are stored in variables, potentially for further processing or injection.",
  "flows": "The script reads JavaScript files from the filesystem into variables, which could then be used in other parts of the program.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no unusual dynamic execution; the code is straightforward file I/O.",
  "analysis": "The code reads two JavaScript files by replacing '__init__.py' in the current filename with specific filenames. These files are loaded into variables but are not immediately executed or transmitted. No user input or untrusted data source is involved. The code does not perform any malicious actions such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code execution. The straightforward file reading suggests standard usage, possibly for embedding or rendering purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing simple file reads of JavaScript assets. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. It appears to be part of a larger application that uses these scripts, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
