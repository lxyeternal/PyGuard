{
  "purpose": "Load specific JavaScript files into variables, possibly for later use or injection.",
  "sources": "Reading from files named 'webgui.js' and 'webgui_jupyter_widgets.js' located relative to the current script.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling; merely reading static files into memory.",
  "flows": "File reads source -> variables holding JavaScript code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious file names beyond typical web assets. No evident malicious code, backdoors, or unusual behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to a variable and reads two JavaScript files into variables. The file paths are derived from the current script filename by replacing '__init__.py' with specific filenames. There is no user input, no network activity, no encryption, or other suspicious operations. The code appears to be straightforward file reading, possibly for web UI purposes. No malicious intent or malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and appears to be for loading JavaScript files related to web GUI components. No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks identified.",
