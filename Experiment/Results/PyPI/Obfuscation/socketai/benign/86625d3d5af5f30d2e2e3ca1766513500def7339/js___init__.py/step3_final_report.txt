{
  "purpose": "The code loads two JavaScript resource files into variables, likely for use in a web UI or Jupyter extension.",
  "sources": "Reads files using open() with paths constructed by replacing '__init__.py' in __file__ with specific filenames.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data transmission or code execution observed.",
  "flows": "File paths are derived from __file__, then files are read into variables without further processing.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic path construction with __file__.replace() and obfuscated variable names; no exception handling present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward resource loading of static JavaScript files. No evidence of malicious activity, code injection, or network communication. Variable names are obfuscated but not malicious. The dynamic path construction could be exploited if environment variables are manipulated, but in typical controlled environments, this is standard practice. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code are present. The absence of exception handling around open() calls is a robustness concern but not a security flaw.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard resource loading for UI components. No malware, malicious obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The low malware score (0), minimal obfuscation (0.2), and very low risk (0.1-0.2) are appropriate given the analysis.",
