  "purpose": "Render Graphviz source files into PNG images for visualization.",
  "sources": "Reads Graphviz source code from specified files, primarily through file open/read operations.",
  "sinks": "Outputs rendered PNG images via Source.render() method, writing to disk.",
  "flows": "File content -> Graphviz Source object -> render -> save PNG image.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names, dynamic path construction, no input validation, hardcoded relative paths.",
  "analysis": "The code reads Graphviz source files, creates Source objects, and renders images. Obfuscation is present but appears stylistic rather than malicious. No network activity, credential handling, or code injection is detected. The file operations are straightforward, and the rendering process is standard. The obfuscation may be a concealment tactic but does not indicate malicious intent. No suspicious data flows or external communications are present. The code operates solely on local files, with no evidence of malicious payloads or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility for rendering Graphviz diagrams from local source files. Despite obfuscated naming, there is no indication of malicious behavior or security risks. The low malware score (0) and low security risk (0.2) are appropriate. Obfuscation is notable but not malicious. Overall, the code is safe for use, with minor concerns about input validation and path control, which are typical in such scripts.",
