  "purpose": "Render a Graphviz diagram from a file containing Graphviz source code.",
  "sources": "Reading Graphviz source code from a file specified by a relative path.",
  "sinks": "Rendering the Graphviz source to a PNG image file; no untrusted data used in security-sensitive contexts.",
  "flows": "File content read -> Graphviz Source object created -> Rendered to PNG file.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses obfuscated variable names, which could indicate an attempt to conceal intent. The code dynamically constructs file paths relative to the script location. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious external communications are present.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a helper function to build a file path relative to the script's directory, then reads a Graphviz source file and renders it to a PNG image. The main function specifies the input source file and output path, then calls the rendering function. The code appears to be straightforward in its operation, with no obvious malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscated variable names and dynamic path construction could be signs of code concealment, but they do not by themselves indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a legitimate task of rendering Graphviz diagrams from source files. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation may be unnecessary but does not imply harm.",
