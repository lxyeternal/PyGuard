  "purpose": "Utility for pretty-printing and formatting data structures, likely for debugging or visualization purposes.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'bigraph_viz.visualize_types' and 'bigraph_viz.dict_utils' modules, which are external dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or output data to external systems.",
  "flows": "Input data passed to the formatting function is processed locally; no external data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The function name and variable names are obfuscated or nonsensical, which could be an attempt at concealment or auto-generation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports visualization and utility modules, sets up a PrettyPrinter instance, and defines a wrapper function for formatting data. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is present. The obfuscated naming raises suspicion but does not indicate malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, risk: near 0, obfuscation: moderate to high) are consistent with the benign nature of the code, with obfuscation being the main concern. Overall, the code appears to be a benign utility with no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign data formatting utility with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The current scores are appropriate; the malware score remains at 0, the obfuscation score is justified around 0.6–0.7, and the risk score is minimal (~0.1). No further action is necessary based on this snippet.",
