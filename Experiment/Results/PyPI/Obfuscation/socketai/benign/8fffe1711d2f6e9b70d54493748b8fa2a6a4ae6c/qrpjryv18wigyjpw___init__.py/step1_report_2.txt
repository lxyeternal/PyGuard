  "purpose": "Import visualization and utility modules, define a pretty-print wrapper function",
  "sources": "import statements for modules, usage of pprint.PrettyPrinter",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks observed",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow involving untrusted input or external outputs",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable and function names that appear obfuscated or auto-generated; no clear documentation or intent; no visible malicious actions",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific modules from a package named 'bigraph_viz', likely for visualization ('visualize_types') and data utilities ('dict_utils'). It initializes a PrettyPrinter instance with indentation 2. A wrapper function is defined to format data using this PrettyPrinter. There are no inputs, external data, or suspicious behaviors in this fragment. Variable and function names are non-descriptive, which could be indicative of obfuscation, but no malicious activity is detectable from the provided code. The code is straightforward and does not perform any network activity, file access, or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for pretty-printing data, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscated-looking identifiers are likely just non-descriptive naming or auto-generated, not malicious.",
