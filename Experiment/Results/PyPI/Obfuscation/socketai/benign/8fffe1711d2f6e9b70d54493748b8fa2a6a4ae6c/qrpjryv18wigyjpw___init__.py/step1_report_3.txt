{
  "purpose": "The code appears to import visualization functions and utilities for data structure manipulation, then defines a function to pretty-print data structures.",
  "sources": "The code reads static modules and functions for visualization and utility purposes; no external input sources are directly used.",
  "targets": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code only formats and prints data structures locally.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code simply wraps a print formatting function.",
  "anomalies": "The imported function names are unusually long and nonsensical, possibly obfuscated or auto-generated. No other anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or malicious code are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific visualization and utility modules from a package named 'bigraph_viz'. It initializes a PrettyPrinter object for formatted output. Then, it defines a function that formats any input data using this PrettyPrinter. There are no input or output operations involving untrusted data or external systems. The code structure and function names suggest possible obfuscation, but no malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving primarily for data visualization and formatting. No evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks is observed.",
