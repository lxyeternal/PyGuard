  "purpose": "Utility functions for data processing, including pretty-printing, deep merging dictionaries, path resolution, nested dictionary creation, and string replacement within data structures.",
  "sources": "Functions read data from parameters such as input dictionaries, lists, and strings; no external data sources or network calls are present.",
  "sinks": "Data is manipulated within functions, potentially affecting memory or processing resources; no external system calls or data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through recursive functions and string operations, resulting in transformed data structures or formatted strings.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are heavily obfuscated, which may be an intentional attempt to conceal code intent; no hardcoded credentials or malicious code patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions performing data formatting, deep merging, path handling, nested dictionary creation, and string replacement. No external calls, network activity, or malicious behaviors are present. The obfuscation via variable names is superficial and typical for complex utility code. Recursive functions and deep copies pose potential resource exhaustion risks if inputs are maliciously crafted, but this is a common consideration for such utilities. Overall, the functions serve legitimate purposes such as configuration management or data transformation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility functions with obfuscated variable names. No evidence of malicious behavior or malware is detected. The high obfuscation score reflects variable naming complexity, not malicious obfuscation. The low malware score (0) and low security risk score (~0.2-0.3) are appropriate given the code's nature. The functions are standard for data handling tasks and do not pose active threats.",
