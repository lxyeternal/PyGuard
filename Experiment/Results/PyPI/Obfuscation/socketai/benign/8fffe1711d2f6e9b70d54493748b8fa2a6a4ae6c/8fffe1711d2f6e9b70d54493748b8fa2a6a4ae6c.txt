      "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility for rendering Graphviz diagrams from local source files. Despite obfuscated naming, there is no indication of malicious behavior or security risks. The low malware score (0) and low security risk (0.2) are appropriate. Obfuscation is notable but not malicious. Overall, the code is safe for use, with minor concerns about input validation and path control, which are typical in such scripts."

Despite obfuscated variable names, there is no evidence of backdoors, malware, or malicious data flows. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score is 0."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign data formatting utility with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The current scores are appropriate; the malware score remains at 0, the obfuscation score is justified around 0.6–0.7, and the risk score is minimal (~0.1). No further action is necessary based on this snippet."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign utility functions with obfuscated variable names. No evidence of malicious behavior or malware is detected. The high obfuscation score reflects variable naming complexity, not malicious obfuscation. The low malware score (0) and low security risk score (~0.2-0.3) are appropriate given the code's nature. The functions are standard for data handling tasks and do not pose active threats."
