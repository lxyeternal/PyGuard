{
  "purpose": "The code constructs nested data structures representing biological processes, topologies, and steps, then visualizes them using an obfuscated visualization function.",
  "sources": "Data is read from hardcoded dictionaries, imported modules, and function arguments, including object attributes and constants.",
  "sinks": "Processed data is passed to the visualization function; no external network, file, or system command interactions are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from hardcoded and input dictionaries through deep copies and transformations into visualization routines.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated function and variable names; use of complex nested dictionaries; hardcoded strings indicating different visualization modes.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily for biological data visualization, with functions preparing data structures and invoking visualization routines. No malicious network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications are detected. Obfuscation appears to be a code concealment tactic but does not inherently imply malicious intent. The data flow is contained within the script, and no external or system-level malicious actions are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a complex, obfuscated biological modeling and visualization script with no evidence of malicious behavior. The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not suggest malicious intent. The overall security risk is low.",
