{
  "purpose": "The code is setting up a Python package, reading and processing a README file to modify image links, and defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads from 'README.md' file; no external input sources or untrusted data inputs are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or execute external commands; the code mainly involves file reading and package configuration.",
  "flows": "Data flows from reading 'README.md' -> applying regex substitutions -> passing the processed content into setup metadata.",
  "anomalies": "The variable names are nonsensical and obfuscated, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup procedures: reading a markdown file, modifying image link URLs to point to GitHub raw content, and configuring package metadata. The regex substitutions are straightforward link replacements. Variable naming appears obfuscated but does not indicate malicious intent. No external network connections, command executions, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with obfuscated variable names but no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate package setup with no malware indications.",
