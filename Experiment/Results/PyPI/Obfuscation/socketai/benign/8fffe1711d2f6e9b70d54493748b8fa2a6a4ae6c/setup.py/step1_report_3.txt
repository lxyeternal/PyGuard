  "purpose": "Set up configuration for a Python package distribution, including reading a README file and preparing metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file, importing modules, and package dependencies list.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no untrusted data is being written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Reading and processing README content, then passing static metadata to setup().",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated variable names (e.g., jyOLUfYEDhEGFEHcJtHwiXQiJLKxJiAE), which may indicate obfuscation. No clear malicious behavior detected. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily reads a README.md file and modifies image links with regex substitutions. The setup() call uses static package metadata and dependencies, with no dynamic or untrusted data handling. Variable names are intentionally obscure but do not indicate malicious intent. No evidence of code injection, data exfiltration, or suspicious network connections. The overall structure is typical for a package setup script, and no anomalies suggest malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard package setup configuration with obfuscated variable names, likely for code concealment but no malicious behavior. No security risks identified based on current content.",
