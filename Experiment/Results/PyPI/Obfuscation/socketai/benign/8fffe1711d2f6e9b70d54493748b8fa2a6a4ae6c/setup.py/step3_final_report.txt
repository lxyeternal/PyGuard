{
  "purpose": "The code reads 'README.md', performs regex substitutions to update image URLs to GitHub raw and blob links, and calls setup() with package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file; uses regex to find and replace URL patterns.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network transmission or external data handling beyond file reading and string substitution.",
  "flows": "Reads README.md -> applies regex substitutions -> proceeds with setup() configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; no apparent malicious behavior; URL rewriting seems benign.",
  "analysis": "The script performs benign URL modifications within documentation content and sets up package metadata. Variable names are obfuscated but do not indicate malicious intent. No network activity, secrets, or code injection are present. The obfuscation appears cosmetic or auto-generated, not malicious. No evidence of malware, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. The regex substitutions are straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with URL rewriting for documentation, with obfuscated variable names. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation is likely cosmetic. Overall, the script is benign and safe to use.",
