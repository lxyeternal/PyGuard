  "conclusion": "The analyzed reports are generally accurate and consistent. Suspicious behaviors such as obfuscation and network activity warrant cautious scoring, but no confirmed malicious payloads are identified. Final malware scores are set around 0.2–0.4, obfuscation around 0.2–0.4, and security risks around 0.2–0.45, reflecting moderate suspicion without definitive malicious evidence. Continuous monitoring and further code inspection are recommended for suspicious reports."
