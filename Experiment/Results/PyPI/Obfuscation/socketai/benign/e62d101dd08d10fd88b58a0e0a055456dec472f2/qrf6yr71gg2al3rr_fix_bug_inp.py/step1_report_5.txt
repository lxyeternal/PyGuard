{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple Python script that imports standard libraries and performs a basic operation, likely intended for demonstration or utility purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from standard input, environment variables, or package imports.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include print statements, network requests, or file writes, if present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as input or environment variables to sinks like output functions or network calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected. The code structure is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, performs basic operations, and does not contain obfuscated language features or unusual constructs. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are evident. The code's simplicity reduces the likelihood of hidden malicious intent. Without hidden or external code, the overall risk appears minimal.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be benign, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.",
