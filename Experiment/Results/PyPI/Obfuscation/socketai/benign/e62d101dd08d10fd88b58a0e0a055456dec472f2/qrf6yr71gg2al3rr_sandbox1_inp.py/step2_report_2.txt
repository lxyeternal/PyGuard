  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their assessments with the actual code, and then synthesize an overall security risk estimate.\n\n---\n\n**General observations about the code:**\n\n- The code contains utility functions for type comparison, introspection, and AST parsing.\n- It uses obfuscated variable names, which may suggest an attempt to conceal intent.\n- There are syntax issues and undefined variables in some functions (e.g., 'only_in_actual', 'only_in_expect', 'key', 'value', 'expect_value'), indicating incomplete or poorly maintained code.\n- The code imports from 'inspect_py.utils_inp' and standard modules like 'ast', 'inspect', 'builtins', which could be exploited if misused.\n- No network activity, data exfiltration, or direct malicious actions are evident.\n- The functions could be used for analysis, testing, or dynamic code inspection.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- Highlights obfuscation, incomplete code, and incorrect use of 'inspect'.\n- Assigns a **malware score of 0.1**, reasoning that static inspection is benign but could be misused.\n- **Risk score: 0.2**, considering low but some concern due to obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Mainly utility with some suspicion due to obfuscation; no active malware.\n\n**Assessment:** Reasonable, given the code's nature. The low malware score aligns with the lack of malicious actions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Focuses on the utility nature, AST parsing, and inspection functions.\n- Notes obfuscation but finds no malicious payloads.\n- **Malware score: 0**, considering purely utility functions.\n- **Risk score: 0.2**, as static analysis tools can be misused but are not inherently malicious.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate; the code is utility-focused with moderate obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Similar to above, emphasizing that the code is for analysis/testing, not malicious.\n- Obfuscation is moderate, but no malicious actions.\n- **Malware score: 0**, consistent with benign utility functions.\n- **Risk score: 0.2**.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate; no active threats identified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Describes utility functions for type checking, inspection, and AST parsing.\n- Recognizes obfuscation but no malicious payloads.\n- **Malware score: 0**, as no malware is evident.\n- **Risk score: 0.2**.\n\n**Assessment:** Valid; the code is utility-oriented.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Similar analysis; emphasizes that the code is for testing/analysis, with no malicious actions.\n- Notes obfuscation but no malware.\n- **Malware score: 0**, consistent.\n- **Risk score: 0.2**.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of all reports:\n\n- All reports agree that the code is primarily utility functions with obfuscated variable names.\n- No evidence of malicious payloads, network activity, or data exfiltration.\n- The main concern is obfuscation and incomplete code, which could be exploited if combined with malicious inputs or modules.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** Given the lack of any malicious activity, code execution, or external communication, the malware score should remain very low, close to 0.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** The obfuscation is moderate to high, so a score around 0.6-0.7 is justified.\n\n**Risk score:** Considering the obfuscation and potential misuse in larger contexts, a moderate risk score (~0.3) is appropriate, but not high.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n| Score Type      | Estimated Value |\n|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Malware         | **0.0**         |\n| Obfuscated      | **0.65**        |\n| Security Risk   | **0.3**         |\n\nThe code appears to be utility functions with obfuscation that could be misused but does not contain active malware or malicious behavior in its current form. Proper vetting of the 'utils_inp' module and context of use is recommended, but based solely on this code, the security risk remains low.",
