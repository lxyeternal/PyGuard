  "purpose": "Utility functions for type checking, code inspection, and analysis of Python code, including AST parsing and function inspection.",
  "sources": "Imports modules such as 'inspect', 'ast', 'builtins', and reads Python files from given paths.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'ast.parse' to analyze code structure, and potentially could execute functions or inspect code objects (though no direct malicious actions are evident).",
  "flows": "Reads file content -> Parses into AST -> Visits nodes -> Collects function names and nodes.",
  "anomalies": "Code uses obscure variable names, no clear credential or secret hardcoding, but the code involves AST parsing and inspection, which can be manipulated for malicious code obfuscation or dynamic code execution if misused. The code imports and manipulates 'inspect' and 'ast' modules in ways that could be exploited if combined with malicious payloads or if used to analyze malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several utility functions: one for comparing expected and actual values with verbose output, another for listing built-in functions, another for extracting function parameter info via inspect, and a final one for parsing a Python script into an AST and collecting certain nodes. The functions do not perform any network, file write, or data exfiltration actions, nor do they contain explicit backdoors or malicious commands. However, the presence of code that inspects other code (via 'ast') and the obscure variable names suggests an intent to analyze or manipulate code, which could be misused for malicious purposes if integrated into larger malicious workflows. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious payloads are directly visible. The code’s obfuscation level is moderate due to naming, but it is not obfuscated intentionally to hide malicious intent. Overall, the code appears to be utility in nature, with potential for misuse in malicious context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily utility functions for code inspection and analysis, with no explicit malicious actions or malware. However, its capabilities to parse and inspect other code can be exploited for malicious purposes in a larger context. The overall security risk appears low, but caution should be exercised when integrating or executing in untrusted environments.",
