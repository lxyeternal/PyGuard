{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for data comparison, introspection of built-in functions, inspecting function parameters, and parsing Python code files to extract specific nodes.",
  "sources": "Reading input data from function parameters and reading Python files from disk.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that process untrusted data for security-sensitive operations are evident; functions mainly perform data inspection and AST parsing.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through comparison functions; file reading and AST node collection do not involve untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names and lack of comments; the code imports from 'inspect_py.utils_inp' which is external, but no malicious behavior is directly apparent. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious network activities are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code includes functions for comparing actual and expected values, inspecting built-in functions, analyzing function parameters, and parsing Python files to extract specific AST nodes. The comparison function includes some undefined variables such as 'only_in_actual' and 'only_in_expect', indicating incomplete implementation or potential obfuscation. The code does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration. Obfuscated variable names and lack of comments suggest code that may be intentionally obscure, but no malicious behavior or malware signatures are evident. No external data or user inputs are processed in a way that could lead to security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be utility functions for code testing and analysis, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. Its obfuscated style could hinder readability but does not imply malicious intent. Overall, it does not pose significant security concerns.",
