  "purpose": "Utility functions for comparing actual vs. expected values, inspecting code, and parsing Python source files into AST nodes.",
  "sources": "File reading for AST parsing, function arguments for data comparison, and introspection of built-in modules.",
  "sinks": "No network or system modification; primarily internal data processing and static analysis.",
  "flows": "Input data from function parameters and file contents flow into comparison, inspection, and AST parsing functions without external communication.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, incomplete code snippets with undefined variables (e.g., 'only_in_actual', 'only_in_expect'), incorrect usage of 'inspect' module, and syntactic issues indicating obfuscation or errors.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions for data comparison, code inspection, and static analysis via AST parsing. Obfuscated naming and incomplete snippets suggest attempts to conceal intent or poor maintenance. No network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications are present. The functions could be misused in malicious contexts, but in isolation, they serve benign purposes such as testing or code analysis. The import from 'inspect_py.utils_inp' warrants caution but is not inherently malicious. Overall, the code shows high obfuscation but no active malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily utility functions for code comparison, inspection, and parsing, with significant obfuscation but no evidence of malware or malicious activity. The risk is low, though obfuscation warrants cautious review if sourced from untrusted origins.",
