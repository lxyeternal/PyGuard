  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions for executing notebooks and analyzing dependencies, with no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. Obfuscation is moderate and likely for concealment rather than malicious purposes. The main security concern is executing untrusted notebooks, which should be handled with caution. Overall, the code is benign but warrants standard sandboxing practices when handling untrusted inputs."
