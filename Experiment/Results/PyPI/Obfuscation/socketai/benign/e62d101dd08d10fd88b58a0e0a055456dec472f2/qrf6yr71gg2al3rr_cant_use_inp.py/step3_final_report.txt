  "purpose": "Utility functions for executing notebooks and analyzing dependencies in Python code.",
  "sources": "File I/O for reading and writing notebooks, import of external modules, code parsing via AST.",
  "sinks": "Execution of notebooks which can run arbitrary code, dependency analysis outputs.",
  "flows": "Read notebook file -> execute notebook -> write back; parse code for dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obscure variable names, some incomplete or inconsistent code snippets, potential obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard tasks such as reading notebooks, executing them with nbconvert, and analyzing Python scripts for dependencies via AST. No hardcoded secrets or network activity are evident. Variable obfuscation is present but appears superficial. The execution of notebooks could pose security risks if inputs are untrusted, but this is a known and controlled behavior. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or signs of sabotage are detected. Some functions contain incomplete code or undefined variables, indicating poor quality or obfuscation, but not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions for executing notebooks and analyzing dependencies, with no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. Obfuscation is moderate and likely for concealment rather than malicious purposes. The main security concern is executing untrusted notebooks, which should be handled with caution. Overall, the code is benign but warrants standard sandboxing practices when handling untrusted inputs.",
