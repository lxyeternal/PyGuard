{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be related to retrieving the current function name and determining movement directions based on input strings.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function calls and input parameters: 'direction' parameter in 'ASIZkimVqaKMGwGTToHEJFhenCRVOfqs'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any apparent data leaks or dangerous sinks; it simply returns directional vectors.",
  "flows": "Input parameter 'direction' flows into conditional branches to produce directional vectors; no external data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The function 'ZIyKOYzKiiywLYGtuDLGaISyopgGLhCm' retrieves current function name, which is unusual but not malicious. The directional function is straightforward. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present. The function names are obfuscated but do not imply malicious intent. No network, file, or environment variable access is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an obfuscated function that retrieves its caller's name, possibly for logging or tracing, which alone is not suspicious. The second function maps direction strings to coordinate vectors, which is typical in movement or control logic. No external data sources, network activity, or dangerous operations are present. The code is simple, lacks external dependencies, and does not perform any malicious actions or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is benign, consisting of utility functions for retrieving the caller's function name and mapping movement directions. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attack, or security risks in this fragment.",
