{
  "purpose": "The code defines functions to retrieve the name of the caller function and to determine movement directions based on input strings.",
  "sources": "inspect.currentframe(), inspect.getouterframes() for frame inspection; input parameter 'direction' for the second function.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any direct sinks such as network communication, file I/O, or data leaks.",
  "flows": "The function ZIyKOYzKiiywLYGtuDLGaISyopgGLhCm() retrieves the caller function name; ASIZkimVqaKMGwGTToHEJFhenCRVOfqs() maps direction input to coordinate deltas.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. Function naming appears obfuscated, but that alone is not malicious. No dynamic code execution, external communication, or data exfiltration present.",
  "analysis": "The first function uses Python's inspect module to get the current and outer frames, then extracts the caller function name. This could be used for debugging, logging, or control flow. The second function maps directional strings ('up', 'down', 'left', 'right') to coordinate change vectors, which is typical in game or movement logic. There is no indication of malicious intent, such as hidden backdoors, data theft, or external communication. The code appears benign, simply performing introspection and input-to-output mapping.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is benign and does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be utility functions for introspection and direction handling without any suspicious or harmful actions.",
