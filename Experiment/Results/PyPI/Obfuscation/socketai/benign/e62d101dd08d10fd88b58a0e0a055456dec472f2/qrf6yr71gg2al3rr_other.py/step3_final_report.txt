  "purpose": "Utility functions for call stack inspection and directional movement mapping.",
  "sources": "Uses 'inspect' to retrieve caller function name; maps direction strings to coordinate offsets.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; internal function logic only.",
  "flows": "Function call to 'inspect' flows to caller info retrieval; direction input flows to coordinate output.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function and variable names; use of 'inspect' for introspection; no malicious payloads detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two utility functions: one retrieves the caller's function name using 'inspect', and the other maps directional strings to coordinate offsets. No external I/O, network activity, or data exfiltration is present. The obfuscated naming could be for evasion but does not indicate malicious intent. The functions are straightforward and benign, serving likely debugging or movement logic purposes. No hardcoded secrets, malicious payloads, or suspicious data flows are evident. The use of 'inspect' and obfuscated names increases the obfuscation score but does not imply malicious behavior. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, with some noting obfuscation and introspection as potential concerns but not malicious. The malware score remains at 0, and the security risk is very low (~0.1-0.2). The obfuscation score is justified as high (~0.7-0.8) due to nonsensical naming, but this is superficial. Overall, the code is benign utility code with obfuscation but no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as utility functions for introspection and movement logic. Obfuscation is present but does not indicate malicious activity. The assessments and scores in the reports are appropriate; no changes are necessary.",
