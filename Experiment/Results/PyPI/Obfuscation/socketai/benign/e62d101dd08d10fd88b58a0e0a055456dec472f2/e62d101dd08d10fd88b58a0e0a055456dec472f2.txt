      "obfuscated": 0.85,
      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code is suspicious due to obfuscated, nonsensical parameter names and potential concealment of secrets or malicious dependencies. While no explicit malicious actions are evident, the obfuscation warrants a high suspicion level. Further static or dynamic analysis is recommended before trusting or deploying this package."

The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not indicate malicious intent. The undefined 'ans' is likely an obfuscation artifact or incomplete code. Overall, the code poses low security risk and no malware threat based on current analysis."

No evidence of malicious activity is present, but the import style and naming should be monitored, especially if the imported modules are untrusted. Overall, the security risk is low, with a moderate concern for obfuscation and import practices."

      "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions for executing notebooks and analyzing dependencies, with no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. Obfuscation is moderate and likely for concealment rather than malicious purposes. The main security concern is executing untrusted notebooks, which should be handled with caution. Overall, the code is benign but warrants standard sandboxing practices when handling untrusted inputs."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The analyzed reports are generally accurate and consistent. Suspicious behaviors such as obfuscation and network activity warrant cautious scoring, but no confirmed malicious payloads are identified. Final malware scores are set around 0.2–0.4, obfuscation around 0.2–0.4, and security risks around 0.2–0.45, reflecting moderate suspicion without definitive malicious evidence. Continuous monitoring and further code inspection are recommended for suspicious reports."
