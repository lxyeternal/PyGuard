{
  "purpose": "The code imports modules from the 'inspect_py' package and assigns a version string to an obfuscated variable, with no further operations.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'inspect_py.utils_inp' and 'inspect_py.sandbox1_inp' modules.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no data flows, network activity, or external outputs.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present; the code only performs imports and a variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports ('*') which can conceal malicious functions; highly obfuscated variable name 'ZMuZWSkvuwLwjabHIlelXTZybJpsovcx'.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard import statements and assigns a version string to an obfuscated variable. No malicious activity, network communication, or data exfiltration is evident. Wildcard imports pose a risk by potentially hiding malicious functions, and the obfuscated variable name suggests an attempt to conceal intent. The code's minimal nature and lack of suspicious behavior suggest low malware likelihood, but the import style and naming warrant cautious monitoring. Scores are assigned accordingly, with a slightly elevated obfuscation and import risk due to potential concealment tactics.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign in isolation but contains indicators (wildcard imports, obfuscated variable name) that warrant cautious review. No evidence of malicious activity is present, but the import style and naming should be monitored, especially if the imported modules are untrusted. Overall, the security risk is low, with a moderate concern for obfuscation and import practices.",
