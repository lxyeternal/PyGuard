{
  "purpose": "The code imports modules from the 'inspect_py' package and sets a version string, likely for use in a larger application or script.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'inspect_py.utils_inp' and 'inspect_py.sandbox1_inp', and a hardcoded version string.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are evident; no untrusted data handling or external communication present.",
  "flows": "No significant data flows are observable; the imports suggest reliance on external modules, and the version string is static.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of two import statements without further code; no apparent anomalies, but the imports could be suspicious if 'inspect_py' is malicious or compromised. The version string is hardcoded, which is standard, but no other suspicious activity is present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules from a package named 'inspect_py', which may be legitimate or malicious. The version string '0.1.4' is static. There are no functions, data handling, or external network interactions. The code's simplicity limits detection of malicious behavior, but nothing suspicious or malicious is directly evident. The import statements could be normal if 'inspect_py' is trusted, or malicious if the package is compromised. No other code constructs or operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on the provided code, there is no direct evidence of malicious activity. The code appears to import modules and define a version string, which is typical setup code. However, without additional context on the modules being imported, potential malicious behavior cannot be completely ruled out. The code is minimal and does not show malicious behavior in isolation.",
