  "anomalies": "The variable name 'ZMuZWSkvuwLwjabHIlelXTZybJpsovcx' is highly obfuscated, which could be suspicious, but it only stores a version string.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two modules from the 'inspect_py' package, which may be part of a larger project. The variable name is obfuscated, but it only stores a string indicating version '0.1.4'. There are no apparent data flows, network connections, or malicious actions. The imports are standard, and no other suspicious activity or code is present in this snippet. Without additional context, it appears benign but the obfuscated variable name warrants cautious consideration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal, importing modules and setting a version string with an obfuscated variable name. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks within this snippet, though the obfuscated variable name could be used to hide malicious intent in a broader context.",
