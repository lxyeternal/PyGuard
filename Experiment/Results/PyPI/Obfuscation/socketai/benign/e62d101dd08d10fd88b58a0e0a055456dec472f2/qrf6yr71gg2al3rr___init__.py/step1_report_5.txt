  "purpose": "Import modules from inspect_py package and assign a version string",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'inspect_py.utils_inp' and 'inspect_py.sandbox1_inp'; assignment of a version string",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or potentially dangerous operations identified",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input leading to sensitive operations",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports (from module import *), which can obscure code behavior; no other suspicious or unusual code structures",
  "analysis": "The code imports everything from two modules within 'inspect_py', which can potentially conceal malicious functions or data. The version string assigned is benign and standard. There are no signs of code injection, data exfiltration, or other malicious activity. The wildcard import may hide hidden functions but alone does not indicate malicious intent. No external network connections or sensitive operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with a version variable assignment. Although wildcard imports can hide code details, there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet.",
