  "purpose": "Import utility and sandbox modules from the inspect_py package, and define a version string.",
  "sources": "Import statements from inspect_py.utils_inp and inspect_py.sandbox1_inp; assignment of version string.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data processing or output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only imports modules and sets a variable.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated-looking variable name 'ZMuZWSkvuwLwjabHIlelXTZybJpsovcx', which resembles an obfuscated or intentionally obscure identifier. No other suspicious activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two modules from a package named 'inspect_py' and assigns a string to a variable with a complex name. The imported modules' contents are unknown but are standard import statements. The variable name appears intentionally obfuscated, which could be a red flag for hiding malicious intent, but on its own, it is not conclusive. No external data sources, network activity, or code execution are present. The code appears to be part of a larger project, but this snippet alone does not contain malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code only performs standard imports and a variable assignment, with no evidence of malicious activity or security risks based on this snippet alone. The obfuscated variable name warrants caution but does not confirm malicious intent.",
