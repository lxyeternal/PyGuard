  "purpose": "Obfuscated setup configuration with nonsensical parameter names, likely intended to conceal dependencies or secrets.",
  "sources": "Parameter `'MePIHModdOBbMnNuRGfGrfckXkpeMMCu'` assigned a string; `'GqodTirwegGeUNVlkibDalUmMQMnQaZR'` assigned a list of dependencies; both are used as arguments in `setup()`.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network calls, file I/O, or external communication; potential for concealed secrets or malicious dependencies hidden within obfuscated parameters.",
  "flows": "Obfuscated parameter `'MePIHModdOBbMnNuRGfGrfckXkpeMMCu'` (source) potentially used internally; `'GqodTirwegGeUNVlkibDalUmMQMnQaZR'` (dependencies list) may be loaded or used elsewhere; no direct flow to malicious actions observed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly nonsensical, obfuscated parameter names; assignment of strings and lists to non-standard parameters; syntax inconsistencies if executed as-is; suspicious randomness and obfuscation intended to hide intent.",
  "analysis": "The code employs obfuscated parameter names and values in a `setup()` call, which are not standard in `setuptools`. The parameter `'MePIHModdOBbMnNuRGfGrfckXkpeMMCu'` is assigned a string that appears random, possibly a secret or placeholder. The `'GqodTirwegGeUNVlkibDalUmMQMnQaZR'` parameter holds a list of dependencies but is assigned to a non-standard key, indicating obfuscation or corruption. No active malicious actions such as network activity, file manipulation, or code execution are present, but the obfuscation itself is suspicious and could conceal malicious dependencies or secrets. The syntax as shown would not run correctly in Python, further suggesting obfuscation or code meant to hide malicious intent. Given the high obfuscation level and potential for concealed malicious payloads, the malware suspicion is moderate to high, and the overall security risk warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is suspicious due to obfuscated, nonsensical parameter names and potential concealment of secrets or malicious dependencies. While no explicit malicious actions are evident, the obfuscation warrants a high suspicion level. Further static or dynamic analysis is recommended before trusting or deploying this package.",
