{
  "purpose": "Defines a configurable residual neural network module with dynamic layer construction and optional visualization.",
  "sources": "Input tensor from torch.rand in main; internal parameters and data structures within class methods.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; no network calls or file operations outside visualization.",
  "flows": "Data flows through sequentially constructed layers; visualization library processes the model; internal data processing within class methods.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated variable names, dynamic class imports, complex parameter handling, and nested function calls.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a neural network with flexible configurations, using dynamic imports and variable parameters. Obfuscation is notable but appears to serve proprietary or complexity reasons. No evidence of network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads. Visualization is performed via a standard library. The structure and behavior align with legitimate deep learning model code, with obfuscation being the primary concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, complex neural network implementation with obfuscation likely for proprietary reasons. No malicious activity or supply chain attack indicators are present. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is approximately 0.7, and security risk score is around 0.2.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
