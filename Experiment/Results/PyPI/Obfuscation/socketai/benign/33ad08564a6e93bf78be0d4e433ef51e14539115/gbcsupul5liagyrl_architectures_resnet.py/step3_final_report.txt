{
  "purpose": "The code constructs neural network models with visualization, using heavily obfuscated class and variable names, importing external modules with non-descriptive names.",
  "sources": "Imports from external modules, class initializations, and dummy input tensor for visualization.",
  "sinks": "No network communication, data exfiltration, or malicious data flows; visualization is local.",
  "flows": "Input tensor passes through encoder, residual blocks, and classifier; visualization occurs after model instantiation.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of class and variable names; no malicious code, network activity, or secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple neural network classes with obfuscated names, primarily for model construction and visualization. No signs of malicious behavior such as network calls, data leaks, or backdoors. Obfuscation appears to be for concealment or intellectual property reasons rather than malicious intent. Scores assigned in the reports (malware 0.0, obfuscation high around 0.7, risk low around 0.2) are consistent with the observed benign behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard neural network setup with visualization, heavily obfuscated but without malicious activity. The malware score remains at 0.0, and the overall security risk is low. Obfuscation is justified but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.75,
