  "security_risk": 0.4,

  "conclusion": "The code does not contain active malware but employs obfuscation and malformed syntax that could be used to hide malicious dependencies or sabotage the setup process. The high obfuscation score reflects suspicion, while the malware score remains at zero. The overall security risk is moderate, warranting caution and further analysis before deployment."
