{
  "purpose": "The code aims to define package metadata and dependencies for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata from the parameters passed to setup(), notably the package name, version, license, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "Potential untrusted data flows are limited; however, the malformed or obfuscated key 'OsQAgnLTbjdNlAZiHpDsNVzvsnRfjmMi' could interfere with dependency installation or hide malicious dependencies.",
  "flows": "The dependencies listed under the suspicious key are intended to be installed but are not due to the invalid parameter name, leading to potential sabotage or misconfiguration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a nonsensical, obfuscated parameter name instead of the standard 'install_requires'; malformed syntax in the code; import of 'find_namespace_packages' which is unused; 'license' set to 'private' which is non-standard but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup functions but uses an invalid parameter name that resembles obfuscation, preventing proper dependency installation. The dependencies listed are legitimate packages. The malformed syntax and unusual parameter suggest an attempt at obfuscation or sabotage. No active malicious code, network activity, or data exfiltration is present. The obfuscation scores are high due to the nonsensical key, while malware scores are low because no malicious payloads are detected. The overall risk is moderate, mainly due to misconfiguration and obfuscation, which could be exploited to hide malicious dependencies or sabotage the package.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain active malware but employs obfuscation and malformed syntax that could be used to hide malicious dependencies or sabotage the setup process. The high obfuscation score reflects suspicion, while the malware score remains at zero. The overall security risk is moderate, warranting caution and further analysis before deployment.",
