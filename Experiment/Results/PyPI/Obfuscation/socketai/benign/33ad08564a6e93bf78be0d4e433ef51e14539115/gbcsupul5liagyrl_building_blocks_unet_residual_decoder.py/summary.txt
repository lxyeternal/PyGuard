  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code is a sophisticated, obfuscated neural network module with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The high obfuscation is likely for proprietary reasons, and the absence of malicious indicators justifies a malware score of 0 and a low security risk. The overall assessment supports the scores provided in the reports."
