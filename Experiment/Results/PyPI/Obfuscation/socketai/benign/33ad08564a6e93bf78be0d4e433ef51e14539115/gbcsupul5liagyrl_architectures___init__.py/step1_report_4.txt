  "purpose": "This code appears to be a simple utility to process input data and perform some operations, possibly for data transformation or computation.",
  "sources": "Input functions such as reading from environment variables, files, or user input prompts.",
  "sinks": "Output functions such as printing to console, writing to files, or network transmissions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions and finally to output sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscated code, or unusual dynamic execution found. The code uses standard library functions with typical patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code reads input data, performs some processing, and outputs results. No evident malicious functions like network connections to suspicious domains, data exfiltration, or system tampering. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors. Usage of standard modules and straightforward logic suggest benign behavior. No obfuscation or obfuscated code structures detected. The code's purpose aligns with typical utility scripts.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no indication of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a normal utility script with no suspicious signals.",
