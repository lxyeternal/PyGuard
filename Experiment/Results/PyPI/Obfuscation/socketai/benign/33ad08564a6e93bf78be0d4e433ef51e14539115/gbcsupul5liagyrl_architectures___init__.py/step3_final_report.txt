  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, network communication, dynamic code execution, input handling, data processing functions.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, file I/O, environment variables, eval/exec functions, data leaks via logs or external outputs.",
  "flows": "Source (environment variables, inputs) -> potential eval/exec or network transmission -> data exfiltration or malicious payload execution.",
  "anomalies": "Potential use of eval/exec without safeguards, network activity without clear purpose, lack of documentation, suspicion of obfuscation despite no explicit obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code shows no concrete evidence of malicious functions such as eval/exec or known malicious domains. Suspicion arises mainly from environment variable usage and network activity, which are common in malicious scripts but also in benign applications. The malware score of 0.4 in Report 1 is somewhat high given the lack of explicit malicious indicators; reducing it to 0.2 aligns better with the evidence. Other reports consistently show no malware or obfuscation, with scores appropriate to their benign nature. The security risk scores reflect moderate suspicion in some cases but do not indicate immediate danger. Overall, the code appears low risk with some caution warranted in Report 1 due to suspicion but no confirmed malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "Most code is benign; suspicion in Report 1 is moderate but not confirmed. Adjusting the malware score in Report 1 downward from 0.4 to 0.2 improves consistency. The overall security posture is low risk, with no evidence of obfuscation or malware in the analyzed snippets.",
