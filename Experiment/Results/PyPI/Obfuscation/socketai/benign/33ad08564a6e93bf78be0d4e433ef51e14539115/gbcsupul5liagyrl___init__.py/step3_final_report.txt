  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code reading input, environment variables, dynamic execution, hardcoded strings, network or file operations.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, system commands, environment variables, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Input sources to sinks via dynamic execution, obfuscated code paths, or data processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "Moderate obfuscation, dynamic code execution, suspicious strings, hardcoded credentials, misleading variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which increase suspicion but lack concrete malicious payloads. The presence of suspicious strings and potential data flows suggest possible malicious intent, but no definitive malicious actions are observed. The scores assigned in the reports generally reflect these observations, with higher scores in reports indicating more obfuscation and suspicion. The overall risk remains low to moderate, aligning with the evidence.",
  "conclusion": "The reports' scores are consistent with their analyses. The highest suspicion is in reports 2 and 3, justified by obfuscation and dynamic code features. No evidence of active malware or malicious payloads is present. The current scoring accurately reflects the observed behaviors and potential risks.",
