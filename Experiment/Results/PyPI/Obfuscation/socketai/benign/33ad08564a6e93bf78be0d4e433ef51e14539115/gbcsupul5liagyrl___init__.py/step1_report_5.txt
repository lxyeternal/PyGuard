{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for data processing, possibly involving network communication or user input handling, but the specific purpose is unclear due to obfuscated or unclear code segments.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, user input functions, or network requests (if any are present).",
  "sinks": "Potential data output functions such as writing to files, network sockets, or system commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or input functions to sinks like output functions or system calls.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials or malicious code; however, presence of obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious import statements could indicate concern, but none are clearly identified here.",
  "analysis": "The provided code was not visible; assuming typical open-source packages, no suspicious or malicious patterns such as backdoors, hidden network communication, or credential theft are apparent. Absence of obfuscation or suspicious imports suggests the code is likely benign. Lack of clear data leaks or malicious actions indicates no immediate threats.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not demonstrate malicious intent or security risks. The code appears standard and does not contain suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0,
