  "conclusion": "The code is an obfuscated override of Selenium's wait functions, likely for customized waiting behavior. There is no direct evidence of malicious activity, but the heavy obfuscation and runtime patching warrant caution. The low malware score is justified, and the moderate risk reflects potential misuse if combined with malicious intent."
