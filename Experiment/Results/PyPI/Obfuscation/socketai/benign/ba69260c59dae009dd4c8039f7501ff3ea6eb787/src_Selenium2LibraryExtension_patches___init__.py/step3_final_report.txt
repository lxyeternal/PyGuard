{
  "purpose": "The code overrides Selenium2Library's internal wait functions with custom implementations to manage wait behavior with timeouts and retries.",
  "sources": "Function parameters, robot.utils.timestr_to_secs, internal Selenium2Library methods",
  "sinks": "Modification of Selenium2Library's internal wait functions, no external data leaks or system commands",
  "flows": "Repeatedly calls the provided condition function with timeout checks, replacing internal wait methods",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation via nonsensical class/method names, dynamic patching of internal library methods, reference to undefined variable _wait_until_no_error_exp",
  "analysis": "The code redefines Selenium2Library's wait functions with custom loops that handle retries and timeouts, using obfuscated names to conceal intent. It replaces core internal methods at runtime, which could be exploited if malicious. No network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications are evident. The obfuscation suggests concealment but does not confirm malicious intent. The undefined reference to _wait_until_no_error_exp indicates incomplete or externally dependent code, which could cause runtime errors. Overall, the code appears to be a controlled customization for testing or automation, not malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is an obfuscated override of Selenium's wait functions, likely for customized waiting behavior. There is no direct evidence of malicious activity, but the heavy obfuscation and runtime patching warrant caution. The low malware score is justified, and the moderate risk reflects potential misuse if combined with malicious intent.",
