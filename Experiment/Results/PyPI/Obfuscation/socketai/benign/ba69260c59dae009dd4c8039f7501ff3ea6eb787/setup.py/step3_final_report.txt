  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, defining metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Package name, 'download_url', and the suspicious parameter 'TAbgVMlICryAZqslWWYhrsRCuSLLfexp' in setup()",
  "sinks": "External URL download, obfuscated parameter potentially affecting installation or dependencies",
  "flows": "Obfuscated package name and parameter read during setup; external URL used for package download",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated package name, non-standard parameter 'TAbgVMlICryAZqslWWYhrsRCuSLLfexp', external URL, lack of dynamic code",
  "analysis": "Static code analysis reveals obfuscated package name and parameter, which are not typical and suggest obfuscation. The download URL points to a GitHub tarball, which could be legitimate or malicious. No active malicious code or dynamic behavior is present. The suspicious parameter is not a standard setup argument, indicating possible tampering or concealment. The obfuscation and external URL warrant further verification, but no direct malicious activity is evident from static analysis. Malware score is low (0.2), obfuscation is high (0.75), and overall security risk is moderate (0.5).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with signs of obfuscation and external dependency that could hide malicious payloads. No active malicious code detected, but obfuscation and external URL warrant caution. Further verification of the external source and contents is recommended before deployment.",
