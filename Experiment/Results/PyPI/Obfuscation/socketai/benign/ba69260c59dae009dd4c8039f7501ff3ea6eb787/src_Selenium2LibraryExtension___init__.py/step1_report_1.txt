  "purpose": "This code defines a custom class extending Selenium2Library for enhanced web automation with additional location strategies.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration parameters during initialization, such as implicit_wait and run_on_failure. It also reads the 'screenshot_root_directory' parameter. It executes JavaScript scripts via browser.execute_script() in custom location strategies.",
  "sinks": "Execution of JavaScript code with 'browser.execute_script' which uses string interpolation for jQuery selectors. No untrusted input appears directly in the scripts, but potential for indirect injection exists if criteria are user-controlled.",
  "flows": "Initialization parameters flow into the class setup. The custom strategies invoke browser.execute_script() with string-formatted selectors, potentially allowing untrusted 'criteria' to be injected into JavaScript code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic string formatting in JavaScript code strings ('return $('meta[name=%s]');' % criteria) without validation or sanitization of 'criteria'. This could lead to JavaScript injection if 'criteria' is user-controlled. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. No obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code extends Selenium2Library with custom location strategies that rely on executing JavaScript with jQuery selectors. The 'criteria' parameter is interpolated directly into JavaScript strings without validation, which could be exploited for code injection if input is untrusted. The rest of the code manages class initialization and method definitions. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communication, or system compromise is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements custom Selenium strategies that could be vulnerable to JavaScript injection via unvalidated 'criteria' input. No malicious intent or malware is evident. The primary risk is potential injection if 'criteria' is externally controlled. Overall security risk is low but warrants input validation to prevent injection.",
