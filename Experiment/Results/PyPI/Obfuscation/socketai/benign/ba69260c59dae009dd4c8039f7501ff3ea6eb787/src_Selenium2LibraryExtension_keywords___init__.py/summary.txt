  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Selenium utility class with obfuscated names. While obfuscation can be suspicious, there is no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain attack vectors in this segment. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. Continuous monitoring is recommended if used in a broader supply chain context."
