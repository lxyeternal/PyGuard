{
  "purpose": "A Selenium-based utility class providing functions for waiting, verifying, and interacting with web elements, primarily for automated UI testing.",
  "sources": "Methods that read element attributes, CSS properties, focus states, and perform actions like clicking, clearing, or setting focus on web elements.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include element attribute access, CSS property retrieval, and actions like click or send_keys, which could be misused if combined with malicious inputs, but no direct malicious activity is evident.",
  "flows": "Input sources are user interactions or automated scripts; flows involve element searches, attribute checks, and actions like focus or clear, with no network or system modifications observed.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of class and method names, which could be used to conceal malicious intent; no hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a Selenium helper class with functions for waiting, verifying styles, focus, and input manipulation. Obfuscated naming raises suspicion but does not demonstrate malicious behavior. No network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications are evident. The functions perform standard automation tasks, and the obfuscation could be for concealment or code hiding. The malware score is low (around 0.1-0.2), justified by the lack of malicious actions. The obfuscation score is high (~0.75), justified by the naming style. The overall security risk is low (~0.2), considering potential misuse but no active malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Selenium utility class with obfuscated names. While obfuscation can be suspicious, there is no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain attack vectors in this segment. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. Continuous monitoring is recommended if used in a broader supply chain context.",
