      "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with signs of obfuscation and external dependency that could hide malicious payloads. No active malicious code detected, but obfuscation and external URL warrant caution. Further verification of the external source and contents is recommended before deployment."

      "conclusion": "The code does not contain malware or malicious payloads but has a significant injection vulnerability due to unvalidated 'criteria'. Obfuscated naming raises suspicion but is not conclusive of malicious intent. The primary security concern is input sanitization to prevent JavaScript injection; otherwise, the code appears to be a utility extension with potential security risks."

      "security_risk": 0.4,
      "obfuscated": 0.8,
      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code is an obfuscated override of Selenium's wait functions, likely for customized waiting behavior. There is no direct evidence of malicious activity, but the heavy obfuscation and runtime patching warrant caution. The low malware score is justified, and the moderate risk reflects potential misuse if combined with malicious intent."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Selenium utility class with obfuscated names. While obfuscation can be suspicious, there is no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain attack vectors in this segment. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. Continuous monitoring is recommended if used in a broader supply chain context."
