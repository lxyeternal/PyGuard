{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package, used to specify package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.rst file for long description; loads package dependencies pandas and numpy from the 'install_requires' list.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; no code execution or data leakage points are present.",
  "flows": "Reads static README file content (source) for package description; installs dependencies as specified (no data flow from untrusted sources).",
  "anomalies": "Presence of seemingly random, obfuscated variable names (e.g., girrmMnltbRPADQXXYveuuqPIODRkzPc, lTdNeeHoUhbQgJYFsbGSGkeAGssLTaal) that serve as file paths and data variables, but no malicious behavior evident. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging, with standard imports and usage of setuptools. It reads a README file for description and specifies package dependencies. Obfuscated variable names are unusual but not malicious. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or other suspicious behavior detected. The code appears benign and consistent with normal package setup practices.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard package setup file with obfuscated variable names but no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate setup script for distributing a Python package.",
