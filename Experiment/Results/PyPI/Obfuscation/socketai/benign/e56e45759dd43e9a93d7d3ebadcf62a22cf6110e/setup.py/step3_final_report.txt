  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging, defining dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' file, package dependencies ('pandas>=0.22.0', 'numpy'), and setup() parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, network activity, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Reading README -> setup() parameters (name, version, dependencies, etc.) -> package installation.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names (e.g., girrmMnltbRPADQXXYveuuqPIODRkzPc), inconsistent parameter names in setup() (e.g., RBresVbZhwHKlcEWIqBiQUQANdhzDtYb), which do not match standard 'setup()' arguments.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with obfuscated variable names. It reads a README file and calls setup() with package metadata and dependencies. The variable names are heavily obfuscated, which is suspicious but not inherently malicious. The setup() call contains non-standard parameter names (e.g., RBresVbZhwHKlcEWIqBiQUQANdhzDtYb), indicating possible obfuscation or errors. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks are detected. The code does not contain any malicious logic or secrets. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. The overall structure suggests benign packaging code with obfuscation as the main anomaly.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names. No malicious activity or malicious intent is evident. The obfuscation alone does not imply malicious behavior, but it warrants a higher suspicion score. The code appears benign, with no active security threats detected.",
