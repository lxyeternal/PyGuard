      "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names. No malicious activity or malicious intent is evident. The obfuscation alone does not imply malicious behavior, but it warrants a higher suspicion score. The code appears benign, with no active security threats detected."

      "conclusion": "The code is suspicious mainly because of the obfuscated import name, which could be used to hide malicious intent. However, no direct malicious activity is demonstrated in this snippet. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware and risk scores should remain cautious. Further review of the package contents and the symbol's purpose is advised to confirm or refute malicious intent."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated data processing utility with no evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not justify malware classification. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score should remain at 0. The obfuscation score is justified at approximately 0.8 due to naming obscurity. The security risk score is appropriately low at 0.2."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The dependency code is predominantly benign with low security risks. Report 3's moderate suspicion due to obfuscation and dynamic features is justified but not conclusive of malicious intent. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No further adjustments are necessary unless dynamic analysis reveals malicious payloads."

      "obfuscated": 0,
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no malicious intent or obfuscation detected. The current scoring reflects a very low threat environment. Adjusting the security risk score from 0.2 to 0.0 or 0.1 would better align with the evidence, but the existing scores are acceptable. No malicious activity or obfuscation is present, and the supply chain security posture is sound."
