  "conclusion": "The code is suspicious mainly because of the obfuscated import name, which could be used to hide malicious intent. However, no direct malicious activity is demonstrated in this snippet. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware and risk scores should remain cautious. Further review of the package contents and the symbol's purpose is advised to confirm or refute malicious intent."
