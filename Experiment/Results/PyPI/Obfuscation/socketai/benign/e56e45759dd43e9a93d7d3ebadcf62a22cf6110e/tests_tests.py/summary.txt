  "conclusion": "The dependency code is predominantly benign with low security risks. Report 3's moderate suspicion due to obfuscation and dynamic features is justified but not conclusive of malicious intent. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No further adjustments are necessary unless dynamic analysis reveals malicious payloads."
