  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a simple demonstration or utility script, possibly for testing or educational purposes. It does not indicate any clear malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables and possibly command-line arguments or files, depending on context. No explicit external data sources are evident from the snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include printing to the console, executing dynamic code, or network connections if present. No direct use of untrusted data in dangerous functions is observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or inputs to outputs such as print statements or dynamic execution points, but no explicit dangerous flows are identified in the given code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are evident. The code does not contain obfuscation or unusual language features. No dynamic code execution, network connections, or data exfiltration mechanisms are visible.",
  "analysis": "A step-by-step review shows standard Python constructs, no signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads. The code is straightforward, with no suspicious imports or functions. There is no evidence of data leakage, insecure handling, or malicious behavior. The lack of context makes it difficult to detect covert operations, but based solely on this code snippet, no malicious activity is apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It is a simple, straightforward script with no suspicious behavior. Confidence in this assessment is high, given the absence of harmful patterns or anomalies.",
