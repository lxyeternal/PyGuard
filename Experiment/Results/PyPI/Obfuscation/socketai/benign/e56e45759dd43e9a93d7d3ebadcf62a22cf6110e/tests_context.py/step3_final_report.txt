  "purpose": "Evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and anomalies to assess supply chain security.",
  "sources": "Code input, environment variables, function parameters, network connections, file I/O, data processing functions.",
  "sinks": "Network transmissions, file writes, environment variable access, system commands, logging outputs.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or user input flow into processing functions, which may lead to network communication or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code, lack of suspicious imports, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious network activity, no unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "All reports with no code correctly indicate inability to analyze; benign code reports show standard data handling with no malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity. Scores for malware and obfuscation are consistently zero, aligning with the absence of malicious indicators. Security risk scores are conservatively set at 0.2 in benign cases, reflecting minimal residual risk; however, given the lack of issues, these could be lowered to 0 for more accuracy. Confidence levels are high where detailed review is provided. Overall, the assessments are consistent and justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no malicious intent or obfuscation detected. The current scoring reflects a very low threat environment. Adjusting the security risk score from 0.2 to 0.0 or 0.1 would better align with the evidence, but the existing scores are acceptable. No malicious activity or obfuscation is present, and the supply chain security posture is sound.",
