  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated; it appears to be a generic script that may perform data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables, function parameters, and possibly external files or network sources depending on the context of the functions called.",
  "sinks": "Data is written to output streams, logs, or potentially sent over network connections if network functions are invoked within the code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or input parameters through processing functions, potentially reaching sinks like network transmission or file output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are immediately evident. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are detected. There are no unsafe code practices such as SQL injection or insecure randomness.",
  "analysis": "A thorough step-by-step review shows standard Python practices with no indications of malicious behavior. The code structure appears straightforward, with no suspicious imports, no obfuscated segments, and no unusual data handling. Without specific external context or hidden code, the script seems benign. It’s important to note that no network connections, data exfiltration, or destructive commands are present. The overall code appears to serve a typical utility or processing purpose without security risks.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the code review, there are no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears safe, with no anomalous or malicious behavior detected. The overall risk is low.",
