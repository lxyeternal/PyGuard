{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python module or script with no immediately visible purpose due to lack of comments or documentation. It potentially performs some data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters, local variables, and possibly environment variables (if used). It also imports external modules which could provide data.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks could occur if data is sent over the network, written to files, or printed without validation. Sinks include network calls, file writes, or system commands if present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (parameters, environment variables) through processing functions to sinks like network calls, file outputs, or system commands.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. However, some dynamic execution features or obscure logic could be masked by minimal code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules, defines functions, and performs standard data operations without any clear malicious intent. There are no evident network connections, file manipulations, or dynamic code execution. The absence of comments and minimal structure makes detailed source-to-sink tracing difficult, but nothing suspicious stands out. No obfuscated code or malicious payloads are detected. The code appears benign and aligns with typical utility scripts.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the visible code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems to be a standard Python script with no indicators of malware or security threats.",
