  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the 'abconfig' Python package, including reading version info and long description.",
  "sources": "Reading __init__.py for version info, reading README.md for long description, importing modules, and defining setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "The 'setup()' function could trigger package installation or configuration but does not itself perform harmful actions. No untrusted data execution identified.",
  "flows": "Reading version string from __init__.py -> passing data to setup() for package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a regex to extract version info from __init__.py, but no malicious code or obfuscation present. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors observed. Variable names are obfuscated but do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks: verifying Python version, reading version info via regex, reading README content, and calling setup() with package metadata. All code is typical for a Python package setup script. No suspicious network activity, code injection, or malicious behavior detected. The obfuscated variable names are likely for code brevity or obfuscation but do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. The use of regex to extract version info is common practice. Variable obfuscation does not indicate malicious intent but reduces readability.",
