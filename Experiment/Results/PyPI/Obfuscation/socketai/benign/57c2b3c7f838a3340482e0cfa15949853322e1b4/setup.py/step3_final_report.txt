{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for the 'abconfig' Python package, performing environment checks, extracting version info, reading README content, and invoking setup() with package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading the version string from '__init__.py' via regex, reading 'README.md' content, and static package metadata definitions.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function uses the collected metadata; no untrusted data sinks or external data flows are present.",
  "flows": "Source: regex extraction of version info; Sink: setup() call with package data; No dynamic or untrusted data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names (e.g., 'hSkqlhRnsptIuIeWiNUyEAPhiXNxsmlz') and nonsensical identifiers; no malicious code or network activity; regex usage is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks with obfuscated variable names, which could be an attempt to hide intent but does not contain malicious code. The regex safely extracts version info, and no network or malicious logic is present. Malware scores are zero, and obfuscation scores are high due to variable names. The overall security risk is low. The code's structure and behavior do not indicate malicious activity, only obfuscation, which warrants caution but not suspicion of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with obfuscated variable names. No evidence of malware or malicious behavior is detected. The obfuscation is suspicious but not malicious, and the overall security risk remains low.",
