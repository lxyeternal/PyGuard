  "purpose": "Set up configuration and package metadata for the Python project 'abconfig'.",
  "sources": "Reading the content of '__init__.py' for version info, reading 'README.md' for long description, and accessing package metadata variables.",
  "sinks": "The 'setup' function call that uses collected metadata; reading files from disk.",
  "flows": "Reading version info from '__init__.py' and passing it into setup() to configure package installation.",
  "anomalies": "The variable names are obfuscated and nonsensical, which is unusual for legitimate code. The code reads the '__init__.py' file and extracts a string, which is then used as a version. The obfuscation of variable names and the way the version is extracted can be suspicious. No hardcoded credentials or obvious malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs environment checks for Python version and reads package metadata from files. The obfuscated variable names and the pattern used to extract version information suggest an attempt to obscure code intent, but no malicious actions such as network connections, data exfiltration, or system modifications are observed. It appears to be a typical setup script with obfuscated variable names, which alone is not malicious but raises some suspicion. No malicious code or malware behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a setup script with obfuscated variable names. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks beyond unusual variable naming. No evidence of malware or malicious intent is found.",
