      "conclusion": "The code exhibits significant obfuscation and environment-dependent logic that could conceal malicious behavior, but no explicit malicious actions are confirmed from this fragment. It warrants further review, especially in the context of external modules and environment configurations, but currently poses a moderate security concern."

      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code is highly obfuscated and involves modules that could contain sensitive data, raising suspicion. However, no direct malicious activity is observable from this fragment. The scores in the reports are appropriate, reflecting moderate suspicion primarily due to obfuscation and complexity. Further dynamic or runtime analysis would be necessary to confirm malicious intent."

      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated configuration filtering utility with no direct evidence of malicious activity. While obfuscation can be used to hide malicious intent, there is no concrete indication of malware or active security threats in this snippet. The low malware score is appropriate, with high obfuscation reflecting the code's obscured nature. Overall, the security risk remains low, but further analysis is recommended if integrated into larger systems."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code functions as a legitimate secret management wrapper with heavy obfuscation. No evidence of malicious activity or malware is present. The high obfuscation score is justified, and the overall security risk remains moderate. The scores across reports are consistent with the code's behavior, and no modifications are necessary."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate multi-format configuration loader with high obfuscation and dynamic behavior. While no malicious activity or backdoors are detected, its complexity and obfuscation could be exploited if untrusted configuration files or inputs are processed. Proper validation and input sanitization are recommended before deployment in sensitive environments."

However, no concrete malicious actions are confirmed in this snippet. It should be flagged for further dynamic analysis and review of external method implementations to determine actual risk."

Its obfuscation and complexity could be exploited for malicious purposes, but based on the provided snippets, it appears benign. The malware score should be low but slightly above zero to account for obfuscation, and the overall security risk remains moderate due to potential misuse if combined with untrusted data sources."
