  "conclusion": "The code functions as a legitimate secret management wrapper with heavy obfuscation. No evidence of malicious activity or malware is present. The high obfuscation score is justified, and the overall security risk remains moderate. The scores across reports are consistent with the code's behavior, and no modifications are necessary."
