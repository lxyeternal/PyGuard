{
  "purpose": "Import the wfpt library, likely for watermarking or fingerprinting purposes.",
  "sources": "The import statement loads the wfpt module; no other input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not perform any output, network, or file operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident, as the code only imports a module without further actions.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; only the import statement is present. No suspicious or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement for the 'wfpt' module. Without additional code, there are no apparent source-to-sink flows, no hardcoded secrets, and no malicious behavior. The wfpt module itself is a third-party library, which by itself is not suspicious. The absence of further code or actions makes malicious activity unlikely in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no malicious indicators or security risks evident. It appears to be a harmless module import, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain compromise.",
