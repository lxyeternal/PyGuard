  "purpose": "Import the wfpt module, likely for use in the script's functionality.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the wfpt module from the environment or installed packages.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this snippet; no untrusted data handling or output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow is evident from the single import statement alone.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; no anomalies or suspicious constructs are visible in the import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement for the 'wfpt' module. Without additional context or code, it's not possible to determine malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The import alone does not indicate malware, backdoors, or malicious data handling. 'wfpt' is an external package; usage of third-party libraries is not inherently suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this single line, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is standard import syntax with no suspicious or anomalous features.",
