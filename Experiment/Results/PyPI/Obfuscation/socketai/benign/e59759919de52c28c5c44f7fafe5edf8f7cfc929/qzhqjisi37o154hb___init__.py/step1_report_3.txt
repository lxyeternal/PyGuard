  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths identified due to minimal code provided.",
  "anomalies": "Single import statement; no suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement for the 'wfpt' module. Without additional context or code, it is impossible to determine any malicious intent or security risks. The module name 'wfpt' itself does not suggest malicious behavior, but further code review would be needed to assess its use within a larger program.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the single import statement, there are no apparent security risks or malicious behavior. However, the absence of additional code limits confidence; this snippet alone does not indicate malicious intent.",
