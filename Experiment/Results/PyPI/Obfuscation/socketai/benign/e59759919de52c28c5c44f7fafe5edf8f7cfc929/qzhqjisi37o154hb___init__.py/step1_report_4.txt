{
  "purpose": "Import a third-party library named wfpt, likely for specific functionality related to the package or project.",
  "sources": "The import statement indicates the code reads no external input or data directly.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in the provided code snippet; no untrusted data handling or output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink is observable in this minimal snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only an import statement with no additional logic, which is unusual if intended to be a functional program. The library 'wfpt' is not a standard Python library, but its mere import does not indicate malicious intent. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a third-party module 'wfpt'. The import alone does not reveal any malicious behavior or security issues. Without further context or additional code, there are no indications of malicious activity, backdoors, or data leaks. The snippet is minimal and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement of a third-party module, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks based on this fragment alone. More code would be needed to assess further security concerns.",
