{
  "purpose": "The code imports the 'wfpt' module, which appears to be a third-party package, but no other code is present to determine its purpose.",
  "sources": "Import statement 'import wfpt' - potential source of code execution if 'wfpt' executes code upon import or has malicious side effects.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; no data is processed, output generated, or network activity shown.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow is observable in the provided code fragment, as it only contains an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a single import statement without any further logic or context. The module name 'wfpt' is uncommon and warrants further investigation; absence of usage may be suspicious if 'wfpt' is malicious or unnecessary.",
  "analysis": "The snippet imports the 'wfpt' package but does not perform any operations. Importing a module alone generally is not malicious; however, if 'wfpt' is a malicious package or performs malicious actions upon import (such as executing code in its __init__.py), it could be a concern. The lack of further code limits the ability to assess behavior fully. No hardcoded credentials, data leaks, or suspicious activities are evident in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this minimal code, there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior. However, the import of an unusual or potentially malicious package ('wfpt') could be a risk if the package is malicious or unnecessary. Further context about the package's contents and usage is needed to make a definitive assessment.",
