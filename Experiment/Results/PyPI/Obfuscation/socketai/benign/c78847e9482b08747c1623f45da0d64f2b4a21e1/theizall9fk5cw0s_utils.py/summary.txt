  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of utility functions for data normalization, formatting, and sanitization, with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious payloads, network activity, or sabotage. The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not constitute malicious behavior. The supply chain risk is low, and the malware likelihood is negligible."
