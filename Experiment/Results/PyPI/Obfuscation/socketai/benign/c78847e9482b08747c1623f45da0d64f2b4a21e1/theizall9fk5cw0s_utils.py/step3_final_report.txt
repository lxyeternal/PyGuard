{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for data normalization, date/time formatting, string escaping, and dictionary manipulation, primarily for data processing and sanitization tasks.",
  "sources": "Parameters passed to functions such as datetime objects, strings, regex-extracted data, and dictionary items.",
  "sinks": "Data transformations within functions; no evidence of data being sent to external systems, network, or files.",
  "flows": "Input data is processed through conditional checks, string replacements, date formatting, and dictionary manipulations within functions, with no external data sinks involved.",
  "anomalies": "Heavily obfuscated variable names, large predefined OrderedDicts with seemingly arbitrary mappings, placeholder functions with only docstrings, and complex string replacements without validation or sanitization steps.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple utility functions performing data formatting, string escaping, and dictionary conversions. Obfuscated variable names and large static mappings suggest code concealment but do not indicate malicious intent. No network activity, system modifications, or payloads are present. The regex parsing and string replacements are benign in context but could be misused if fed malicious inputs. The functions are standard data handling routines, and no active malicious behavior or vulnerabilities are evident. The obfuscation level is high, raising suspicion but not proof of malicious activity. The overall behavior aligns with benign data processing utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of utility functions for data normalization, formatting, and sanitization, with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious payloads, network activity, or sabotage. The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not constitute malicious behavior. The supply chain risk is low, and the malware likelihood is negligible.",
