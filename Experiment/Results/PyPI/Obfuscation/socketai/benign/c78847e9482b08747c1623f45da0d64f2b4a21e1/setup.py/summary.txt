  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated package setup script lacking any evidence of malware or malicious activity. The primary issues are obfuscation and outdated practices, which could be exploited if malicious code is hidden within. The malware score remains at 0, and the security risk is low (~0.2), with a high obfuscation level (~0.75). Overall, the package appears benign but warrants caution due to obfuscation and deprecated modules."
