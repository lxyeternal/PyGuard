  "conclusion": "The code appears benign in its current form, with obfuscated names being the only suspicious element. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities within this snippet. Further review of the actual utility functions' implementations is recommended if suspicion persists, but based solely on this import/export fragment, the code is safe."
