  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script intended for data processing or utility functions, with no explicit purpose evident from the snippet provided.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input files, environment variables, and user inputs.",
  "sinks": "The code writes output to files, displays data on the console, and possibly sends data over the network via HTTP requests.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (files, env vars, user input) through processing functions, then to output destinations and network requests.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network domains, and no unusual code constructs. The code uses standard libraries and practices.",
  "analysis": "Step-by-step review shows typical input processing and output generation. No malicious patterns such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The code's structure is straightforward, with clear separation of data sources and sinks. No suspicious loops, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated segments detected. Usage of third-party libraries is typical and does not raise suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate and free from malicious intent. There are no indicators of supply chain attacks, malware, or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
