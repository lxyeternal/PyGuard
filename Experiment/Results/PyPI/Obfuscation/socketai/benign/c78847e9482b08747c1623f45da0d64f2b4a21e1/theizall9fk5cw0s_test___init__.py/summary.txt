  "conclusion": "The assessments and scores are reasonable and consistent with the described patterns. Report 1's suspicion of dynamic code execution justifies its higher malware and risk scores. Other reports are benign or inconclusive, with appropriate low scores. Continuous monitoring and further code review are recommended, especially for Report 1, to confirm malicious payloads if present."
