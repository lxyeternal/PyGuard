  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class that captures command execution details and formats an error message.",
  "sources": "None explicitly, but the class is designed to hold data related to command execution (command, stderr, stdout, code).",
  "sinks": "None present in this code snippet; no direct data leaks or external actions are performed.",
  "flows": "Data is stored in class attributes and formatted into a string representation; no external data flow or command execution is evident here.",
  "anomalies": "The class name appears obfuscated or nonsensical, which can be a sign of intentional obfuscation. No actual malicious activity or backdoors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class inheriting from Exception. It captures command execution details such as command, stderr, stdout, and return code, and provides a custom string representation. There are no code execution, data exfiltration, or network operations present. The class name is unusual and could be obfuscation, but it does not directly indicate malicious intent. No suspicious behaviors like hardcoded credentials or external calls are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a custom exception class for handling command execution errors. While the class name is obfuscated, there is no evidence of malicious activity or security risks within this snippet. It appears to be a benign utility class.",
