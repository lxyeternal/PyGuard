{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class to handle command execution errors with detailed output and error code information.",
  "sources": "Input data includes parameters: command, stderr, stdout, code provided during exception instantiation.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs a formatted string representation of the exception, which could potentially include untrusted command output or error messages.",
  "flows": "Untrusted command output and error messages (stderr, stdout) flow into the exception object and then are formatted into a string representation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class and variable names; no evidence of malicious code or unusual behavior beyond standard exception handling. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The class captures details of a command execution error, storing command, stderr, stdout, and exit code. The __str__ method formats these details into a string. There is no evidence of code injection, malicious behavior, or sabotage. The code appears to be a straightforward custom exception class. No external network activity, data leaks, or suspicious logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code defines a standard custom exception class intended for error handling related to command execution. It does not contain malicious intent or security risks. The implementation is typical for capturing and reporting process errors.",
