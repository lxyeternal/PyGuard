  "purpose": "A utility class for capturing and formatting command execution results, including command, stderr, stdout, and exit code.",
  "sources": "Input data from command execution context (command, stderr, stdout, code).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows; purely data storage and formatting.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters to class attributes and then to formatted string output.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class name and variable names, which could be an attempt at concealment but do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class that stores command execution details and formats them for display. It does not perform any command execution, network activity, or data exfiltration. The obfuscated naming raises suspicion but is not inherently malicious. The class is a benign utility for error handling or logging. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident. The obfuscation suggests concealment but does not imply malicious intent. The malware score should be zero, and the security risk is minimal, primarily related to obfuscation. The high obfuscation score reflects naming but does not equate to malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, utility exception class with obfuscated naming. No evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities is present. The obfuscation is the only concern but does not justify elevated malware or risk scores.",
