  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class that captures command execution details such as command, stderr, stdout, and exit code.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; only class initialization parameters are used.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow to external systems or files.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the class stores data but does not process untrusted input beyond initialization.",
  "anomalies": "Class name is intentionally obfuscated, which could be suspicious. No actual execution or command running is present in this code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class inheriting from Exception, used to store command execution details. The class constructor takes command, stderr, stdout, and code as parameters, strips whitespace from stderr and stdout, and stores all four. The __str__ method formats these details into a string. There is no code execution, input reading, or external data handling beyond storing constructor arguments. The obfuscated class name might be an attempt to hide intent, but on its own, it does not exhibit malicious behavior. No suspicious data leaks, network activity, or command execution is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign custom exception class used for capturing command execution output and errors. No malware or security risks are evident from this snippet. The obfuscated class name is suspicious but not harmful on its own.",
