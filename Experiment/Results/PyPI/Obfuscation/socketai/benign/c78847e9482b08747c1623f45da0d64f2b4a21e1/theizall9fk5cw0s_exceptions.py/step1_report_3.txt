  "purpose": "Custom exception class for capturing command execution results, including command details, standard error, standard output, and exit code.",
  "sources": "Input data is indirectly referenced through class attributes: command, stderr, stdout, and code, which are set during initialization.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; the class simply stores and formats data. No untrusted data is executed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into class attributes, then formatted in __str__ method without any further processing or external effects.",
  "anomalies": "The class name and attribute naming appear intentionally obfuscated, which could be a red flag. However, there is no active malicious behavior such as code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an exception subclass that stores command execution details. It does not execute commands or perform any I/O operations. The use of obfuscated class name and variable names suggests potential concealment, but the logic itself is straightforward and benign. There are no suspicious data leaks, network connections, or malicious actions embedded. The purpose seems to be to capture command results in a structured manner.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple custom exception class with obfuscated naming. It does not perform any malicious actions or contain malware. The primary concern is the obfuscated class name, which might indicate an attempt to hide intent, but functionally it is harmless.",
