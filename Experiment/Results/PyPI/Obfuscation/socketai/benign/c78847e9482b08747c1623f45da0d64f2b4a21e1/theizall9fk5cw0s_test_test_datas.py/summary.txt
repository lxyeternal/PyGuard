  "conclusion": "Based on the thorough review, the code is benign with no indicators of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate, reflecting inherent risks in network and environment variable handling but no active threats. The malware and obfuscated scores are set to 0, consistent with the analysis. Confidence in this assessment is high (0.9), given the consistent findings across reports."
