  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated and employs dynamic class and attribute management, which warrants caution. However, there is no evidence of malicious payloads, network activity, or data exfiltration. The low malware score is appropriate, but the obfuscation suggests ongoing monitoring and verification of imported modules and environment integrity are recommended."
