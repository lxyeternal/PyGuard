      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate DLL loader intended for initializing or extending functionality, not inherently malicious. However, its reliance on external files and use of undocumented flags pose supply chain and exploitation risks. No evidence of malicious intent is present, but caution is advised in untrusted environments."

      "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated and employs dynamic class and attribute management, which warrants caution. However, there is no evidence of malicious payloads, network activity, or data exfiltration. The low malware score is appropriate, but the obfuscation suggests ongoing monitoring and verification of imported modules and environment integrity are recommended."

      "obfuscated": 0.7,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is a standard auto-generated binding for C++ ITK image IO classes, with obfuscation that is typical for such generated code. There is no evidence of malware or malicious behavior. The low malware score (0.0) and low security risk (0.2) are appropriate. Obfuscation is high but justified by the nature of auto-generated bindings. No adjustments are necessary beyond maintaining standard security reviews."

      "conclusion": "The provided reports are accurate, consistent, and appropriately scored. No evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation is present. The low security risk scores are justified given the context. Future assessments should remain vigilant for dynamic or obfuscated code, but current evaluations are sound."

      "security_risk": 0.3,
      "obfuscated": 0.3,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The overall evaluation indicates low likelihood of malicious activity across the dependency, with some suspicion of obfuscation in Report 1. The scores are consistent with the evidence; no concrete malicious behavior is confirmed. The cautious scores in Report 1 are justified given the suspicion, but without code, definitive conclusions cannot be drawn. The assessments are appropriate and do not require adjustments."
