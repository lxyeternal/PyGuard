  "conclusion": "The code is a standard auto-generated binding for C++ ITK image IO classes, with obfuscation that is typical for such generated code. There is no evidence of malware or malicious behavior. The low malware score (0.0) and low security risk (0.2) are appropriate. Obfuscation is high but justified by the nature of auto-generated bindings. No adjustments are necessary beyond maintaining standard security reviews."
