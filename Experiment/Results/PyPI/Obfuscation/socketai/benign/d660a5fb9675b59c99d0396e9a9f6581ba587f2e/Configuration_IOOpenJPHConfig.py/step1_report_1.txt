  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python module or script with no explicit documentation or comments indicating its purpose.",
  "sources": "Reads data from environment variables, file input, and possibly user input via function parameters.",
  "sinks": "Writes data to logs, files, and possibly sends data over network connections or executes system commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or user input to sinks like network operations, file writes, or system calls.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of dynamic code execution functions like eval or exec, use of hardcoded URLs or IP addresses, obfuscated variable names, or conditional code that triggers only under specific conditions. No such anomalies detected in the provided code snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward with standard Python syntax. No use of dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports observed. It uses typical input/output operations, with no indication of malicious intent. The code does not perform any network activity, system modification, or data exfiltration. All functions and variables seem standard and are used in a normal context.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code does not exhibit any signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It appears to be a benign script or module performing standard data handling tasks without malicious intent.",
