{
  "purpose": "To evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and anomalies, ensuring the provided reports are accurate and consistent.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, network operations, data processing functions, input/output points, external library calls.",
  "sinks": "Network communication functions, environment variable access, file I/O, data serialization/deserialization, system commands.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or network inputs feed into data processing or system calls; untrusted data may reach sinks like network sockets or file writes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious network activity detected in the provided code snippets; environment/network usage noted but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious code, obfuscation, or anomalies. Scores of malware=0 and obfuscated=0 are justified. Security risk scores of 0.2 are appropriate, considering potential exposure points like environment variables and network operations, but no evidence of malicious intent. Confidence levels are high (0.8-0.9). The reports are consistent and cautious, appropriately balancing potential risks with observed benign behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided reports are accurate, consistent, and appropriately scored. No evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation is present. The low security risk scores are justified given the context. Future assessments should remain vigilant for dynamic or obfuscated code, but current evaluations are sound.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.2,
