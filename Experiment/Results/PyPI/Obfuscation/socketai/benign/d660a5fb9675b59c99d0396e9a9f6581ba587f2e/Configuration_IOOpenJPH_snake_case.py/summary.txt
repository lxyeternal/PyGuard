  "conclusion": "The overall evaluation indicates low likelihood of malicious activity across the dependency, with some suspicion of obfuscation in Report 1. The scores are consistent with the evidence; no concrete malicious behavior is confirmed. The cautious scores in Report 1 are justified given the suspicion, but without code, definitive conclusions cannot be drawn. The assessments are appropriate and do not require adjustments."
