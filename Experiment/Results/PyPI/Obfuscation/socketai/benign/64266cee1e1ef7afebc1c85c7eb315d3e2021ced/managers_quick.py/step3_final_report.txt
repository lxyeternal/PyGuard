  "purpose": "API wrapper method 'add' constructs a payload with a token and text, updates with optional parameters, and sends it via an obfuscated API call.",

  "flows": "token and text from method parameters to payload, payload to API call over network",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of class, method, and variable names; token stored in instance variable; no explicit secrets visible; data sent over network; no clear malicious code",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass method 'add' that creates a payload with a token and text, updates it with optional kwargs, and makes an API call to 'quick/add' via an obfuscated method. Variable and class names are heavily obfuscated, which raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. The token stored in an instance variable could be a credential, raising security concerns. The code transmits data over the network, potentially including sensitive information. No signs of malicious payloads, code injection, or backdoors are present. The heavy obfuscation and potential credential handling are the main security concerns, but the code appears to be a standard API wrapper.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical API wrapper with obfuscated identifiers and a possible credential token. There is no evidence of active malicious behavior or payloads. The primary risks stem from obfuscation and potential credential exposure, which warrant caution but do not confirm malware. The scores should reflect low malware likelihood, high obfuscation, and moderate security risk due to credential handling.",
