  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, albeit heavily obfuscated, API client for managing filters. No concrete malicious activity or sabotage is evident. The high obfuscation score reflects the difficulty in understanding the code, but the malware score remains low due to lack of malicious indicators. The overall security risk is moderate but justified as low based on current evidence."
