  "purpose": "A class managing filter resources via API calls, including add, update, delete, and retrieve operations.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for filter details, API responses from 'filters/get' and other endpoints.",
  "sinks": "API calls to external endpoints, internal data structures storing filter objects, appending to internal lists.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> API request -> API response -> internal data structures; also, internal data updates -> API calls for modifications.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with nonsensical class and variable names; no direct malicious code or suspicious network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as an API wrapper for filter management, with obfuscated naming that raises suspicion but no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system compromise. It performs standard API interactions, updating internal state accordingly. Input validation is not visible but may be handled elsewhere. The obfuscation is likely intended to conceal intent but does not inherently indicate malicious activity. The code does not perform any network connections to suspicious domains, execute system commands, or handle sensitive data in a suspicious manner.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, albeit heavily obfuscated, API client for managing filters. No concrete malicious activity or sabotage is evident. The high obfuscation score reflects the difficulty in understanding the code, but the malware score remains low due to lack of malicious indicators. The overall security risk is moderate but justified as low based on current evidence.",
