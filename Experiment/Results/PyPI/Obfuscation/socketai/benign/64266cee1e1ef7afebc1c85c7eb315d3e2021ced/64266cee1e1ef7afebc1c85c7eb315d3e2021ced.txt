      "conclusion": "The code appears benign with high obfuscation but no malicious behavior. The obfuscated import name is suspicious and should be reviewed in the context of the full package. The deprecation warning is harmless. Overall, the security risk is low, but obfuscation warrants caution."

      "conclusion": "The code functions as an API wrapper for project management resources, with obfuscated class and method names. There is no evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The obfuscation is notable but likely intended for proprietary or obfuscation purposes rather than malicious concealment. Overall, the code appears benign and safe to use, with a low security risk profile."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, albeit heavily obfuscated, Todoist synchronization client with no static evidence of malicious activity. The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not justify malware classification. The overall security risk is low, and malware likelihood is negligible."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, albeit heavily obfuscated, API client for managing filters. No concrete malicious activity or sabotage is evident. The high obfuscation score reflects the difficulty in understanding the code, but the malware score remains low due to lack of malicious indicators. The overall security risk is moderate but justified as low based on current evidence."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate API client for section management, with heavy obfuscation as the primary concern. No evidence supports malware presence or active malicious behavior. The high obfuscation warrants caution, but the code itself does not exhibit malicious activity. Further review of the broader project context and the 'self.api' object is recommended to ensure security."

      "conclusion": "The code is a typical API wrapper with obfuscated identifiers and a possible credential token. There is no evidence of active malicious behavior or payloads. The primary risks stem from obfuscation and potential credential exposure, which warrant caution but do not confirm malware. The scores should reflect low malware likelihood, high obfuscation, and moderate security risk due to credential handling."

The high obfuscation score reflects suspicion but is not conclusive of malicious intent. The current malware score is appropriate at 0.1, with low security risk (~0.2) and high obfuscation (~0.75). Continued monitoring in the full context is recommended."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate notification management component with heavy obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. The obfuscation warrants cautious scoring but does not elevate the threat level. The overall security risk remains low, and the malware score should be set to 0. The obfuscation score is high due to naming, and the risk score is moderate but justified. Continuous monitoring is recommended, but based on this snippet, the code is benign."

The primary concern is obfuscation, which warrants cautious review but does not indicate malicious intent. The malware score remains at 0, the obfuscation score is high (~0.8), and the overall security risk is low (~0.2)."
