{
  "purpose": "The code imports a specific function from a local module and issues a deprecation warning to inform users to install a different package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module (.api), the warn() function from the warnings module",
  "sinks": "The warn() function could potentially be used to display messages, but here it only issues a deprecation warning",
  "flows": "No untrusted data sources are present; the code only imports and issues a warning",
  "anomalies": "The imported function 'chBINlvebPNQRyeBrPmlsSKvWLkBbiqN' has an obfuscated or nonsensical name, which is unusual and may indicate obfuscation or malicious intent",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward import from a local module and then calls warn() with a fixed message. The function name 'chBINlvebPNQRyeBrPmlsSKvWLkBbiqN' appears obfuscated or randomly generated, which is suspicious. No user input or external data is involved. The warning message is benign, indicating deprecation of a package. There are no signs of malicious behavior or data leaks. The obfuscated function name raises concern about intent, but in itself, it does not execute malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain malicious behavior but includes an obfuscated function name that could be part of a larger pattern of code concealment or obfuscation. The warning is benign. Overall, the code appears safe but warrants caution due to the suspicious function name.",
