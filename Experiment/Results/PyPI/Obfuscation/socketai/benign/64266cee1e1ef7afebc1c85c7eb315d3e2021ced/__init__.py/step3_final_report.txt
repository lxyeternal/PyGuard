{
  "purpose": "The code imports an obfuscated symbol from a local module and issues a deprecation warning, with no active malicious activity evident.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .api module, reading the obfuscated symbol; call to warn() function.",
  "sinks": "The import could lead to use of malicious code if the symbol is malicious; warning message is benign and does not act as a sink.",
  "flows": "Import source (.api module) to symbol usage (not shown), warning message to console/log; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated symbol name 'chBINlvebPNQRyeBrPmlsSKvWLkBbiqN'; the import is unused, which is suspicious; warning message is standard but may be unnecessary.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple import of an obfuscated symbol from a local module and issues a deprecation warning. The obfuscated name raises suspicion but does not demonstrate malicious activity such as network calls, data exfiltration, or payload execution. The import is unused, which could be benign or indicative of obfuscation. The warning is standard and benign. The overall structure is straightforward, with no evident security issues. The obfuscation warrants further review in the broader package context, but based solely on this snippet, no active threat is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with high obfuscation but no malicious behavior. The obfuscated import name is suspicious and should be reviewed in the context of the full package. The deprecation warning is harmless. Overall, the security risk is low, but obfuscation warrants caution.",
