{
  "purpose": "Import a specific component from a local API module and issue a deprecation warning to users.",
  "sources": "The code reads a local module (.api) and a standard library module (warnings).",
  "sinks": "The warning function outputs a deprecation message, which could potentially be displayed to the user or logged.",
  "flows": "The code imports a potentially obfuscated or unusual symbol from the local module and then calls warn to notify deprecation.",
  "anomalies": "The imported symbol 'chBINlvebPNQRyeBrPmlsSKvWLkBbiqN' appears to be a nonsensical or obfuscated name, suggesting possible malicious obfuscation or an attempt to hide the true purpose. The import is from a relative module, which is typical, but the symbol name is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a single symbol with a seemingly random name from a local module, which could be an obfuscated or malicious payload. The use of a relative import indicates it is part of a package. The subsequent call to warn issues a deprecation notice, which is common in package maintenance. The suspicious symbol name warrants further investigation, but based on this snippet alone, there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity or data exfiltration. The warning message is benign and typical for deprecated packages. No sensitive data handling or malicious actions are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be part of a deprecated package with obfuscated symbol naming, which may indicate malicious intent or simply obfuscation. However, there is no direct evidence of malicious activity in this snippet. The warning is standard. Overall, the risk is low, but the obfuscated symbol warrants further review if part of a larger package.",
