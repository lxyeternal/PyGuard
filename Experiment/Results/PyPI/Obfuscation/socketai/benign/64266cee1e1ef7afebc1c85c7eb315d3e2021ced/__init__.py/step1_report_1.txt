  "purpose": "Import a specific function from a local module and issue a deprecation warning to users.",
  "sources": "Reading from the local module '.api' and the 'warnings.warn' function.",
  "sinks": "The warning output may be displayed to the user; no untrusted data sources are evident.",
  "flows": "Import statement does not process untrusted data; warning function displays a message.",
  "anomalies": "Importing from a relative module with an obfuscated or nonsensical name ('chBINlvebPNQRyeBrPmlsSKvWLkBbiqN'), which could be suspicious or intentionally obfuscated.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function with an obscure name from a relative module, which may be an attempt to hide or obfuscate behavior. It then issues a deprecation warning instructing users to install a different package. There is no evidence of malicious activity such as network communication, data leakage, or malicious payloads. The obfuscated import name warrants further investigation, but based on this snippet alone, the code appears to be benign and standard in terms of issuing deprecation warnings.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily a deprecation notice with a suspiciously obfuscated import statement. There is no direct evidence of malicious behavior or malware in this snippet, but the obfuscated import should be reviewed in the broader context of the package.",
