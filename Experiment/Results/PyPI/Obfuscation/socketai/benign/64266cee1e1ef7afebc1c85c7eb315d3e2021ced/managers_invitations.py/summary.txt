  "conclusion": "The code is a standard invitation management component with heavy obfuscation. No evidence of malicious activity, data exfiltration, or security vulnerabilities is present. The primary concern is obfuscation, which warrants cautious review but does not indicate malicious intent. The malware score remains at 0, the obfuscation score is high (~0.8), and the overall security risk is low (~0.2)."
