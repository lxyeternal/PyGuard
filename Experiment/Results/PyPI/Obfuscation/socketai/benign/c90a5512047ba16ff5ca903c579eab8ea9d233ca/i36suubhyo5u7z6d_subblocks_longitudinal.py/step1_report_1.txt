{
  "purpose": "The code defines structured data schemas for particle physics data using classes and arrays, likely for data processing or analysis.",
  "sources": "Imports from .dtypes module, class instantiations with literal values, and list definitions",
  "sinks": "Instantiation of objects that may process or store data, but no direct untrusted data sources or sinks are evident",
  "flows": "Class definitions and list initializations serve as data schemas, with no data flow from external untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. Usage of class instances with literal parameters appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports data type classes and creates lists of class instances with fixed parameters. These instances define data schema fields with identifiers, labels, units, and shapes, typical in data modeling. No external input handling, network activity, or dynamic execution observed. No obfuscated or unusual language features. All code appears straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard for defining data schemas and does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. No indicators of malware, backdoors, or suspicious activities detected.",
