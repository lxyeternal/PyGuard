  "purpose": "Define data structures for particle physics or astrophysics data processing using custom classes and arrays.",
  "sources": "Imports from .dtypes module, creation of data class instances, and list definitions.",
  "sinks": "Data structures are assigned to variables, with no immediate data sinks or external data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Data class instances are created with specific parameters, then passed into EMqOGdxxxrcBCiqyrUhZYpKYBLTCHnNg functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or hidden backdoors detected. Usage of seemingly legitimate classes and functions. No external network or file operations present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple data class instances with specific field parameters, likely for structured data handling in a scientific context. These instances are grouped into lists, then passed into what appears to be data array constructors (EMqOGdxxxrcBCiqyrUhZYpKYBLTCHnNg). No unusual patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are apparent. The data appears consistent with typical scientific data setup, with no signs of data leaks, injection, or malware. The functions used seem to be data container constructors, not executing external code or network operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard data structure definitions for scientific data processing, with no malicious intent detected. It is well-structured and straightforward, with no anomalies or security risks observed.",
