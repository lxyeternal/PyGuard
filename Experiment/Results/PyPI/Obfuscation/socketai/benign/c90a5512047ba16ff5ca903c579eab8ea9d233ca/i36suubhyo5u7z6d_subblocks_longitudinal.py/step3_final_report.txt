  "purpose": "Defines data schemas for particle physics or astrophysics datasets using class instances with fixed parameters.",
  "sources": "Class instantiations with fixed parameters; no external input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data exfiltration or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "Static data initialization; no dynamic data flow from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names, which could suggest code obfuscation or auto-generation; no malicious code or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of class imports and instantiations with fixed parameters, forming data schemas for scientific datasets. No external input, network activity, or dynamic execution is present. The obfuscated naming may be for code concealment but does not indicate malicious intent. All indicators point to benign data structure setup with no malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard scientific data schema definition with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security threats. The obfuscation is notable but not malicious. Malware score is set to 0, and risk remains low. The obfuscation score is high (~0.7) due to naming, but overall security risk is minimal.",
