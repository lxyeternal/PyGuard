{
  "purpose": "Define structured data types and initialize data arrays for particle physics or astrophysics analysis.",
  "sources": "Imports from .dtypes module, creation of data type instances, and array initializations.",
  "sinks": "Data array initializations with no direct untrusted input or external network interaction.",
  "flows": "Imported data type definitions → data type instances creation → data array instances.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. Usage appears consistent with scientific data processing.",
  "analysis": "The code imports data type classes and creates arrays of instances with specific attributes such as identifiers, labels, units, and shapes. The data appears to be for structured scientific datasets, likely for particle or cosmic ray analysis. The arrays are used to group related data fields. There is no evidence of dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious logic. The code lacks network interactions, file operations, or any suspicious patterns. It appears to be a standard data structure setup for scientific computation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign setup of data types and arrays for scientific data processing. There is no indication of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It functions as part of a larger scientific analysis pipeline, with no signs of supply chain or security risks.",
