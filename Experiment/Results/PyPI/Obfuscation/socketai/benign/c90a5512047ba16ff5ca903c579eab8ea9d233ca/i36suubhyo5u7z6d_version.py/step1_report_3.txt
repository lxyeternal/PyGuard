{
  "purpose": "The code attempts to import version information from internal modules and handles errors if the import fails, setting a default version string.",
  "sources": "Import statements from ._dev_version and ._version modules, reading the module's internal version variables.",
  "sinks": "Assignment of the version variable ysMTakVCVpXdkyzuprFnxILQgJLjtQxD, which could be used elsewhere; no direct data leaks or external communication.",
  "flows": "Import attempt (source) -> error handling -> fallback assignment of '0.0.0' -> assignment to a global variable.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated-looking variable names (e.g., ysMTakVCVpXdkyzuprFnxILQgJLjtQxD, EhyNKMoLQkQLeMvHpDCchnQzMXMUOnAa); this may be a form of simple obfuscation but is not malicious by itself. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code's primary function is to import version info from internal modules. It employs nested try-except blocks to handle import errors gracefully, warning users if the version cannot be determined. Variable names are intentionally obscure, but the logic is straightforward and safe. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or malicious code. The use of warnings and default fallback values is typical for package version handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version import pattern with obfuscated variable names, likely for code brevity or minimal obfuscation. No malicious activity or security risks are detected. The obfuscation appears superficial and intentional but not harmful.",
