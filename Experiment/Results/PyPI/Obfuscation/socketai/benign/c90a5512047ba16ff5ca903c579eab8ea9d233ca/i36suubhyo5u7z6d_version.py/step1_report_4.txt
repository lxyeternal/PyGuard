{
  "purpose": "The code attempts to determine and set the version of the package by importing from internal modules or falling back to a default version string if import fails.",
  "sources": "Reading import statements for internal modules (_dev_version, _version) and a fallback assignment of a default version string.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or execution effects; the code only assigns version info and issues warnings.",
  "flows": "Imports or exception handling flow, with fallback to a default version string in case of import failure.",
  "anomalies": "The variable names (ysMTakVCVpXdkyzuprFnxILQgJLjtQxD, EhyNKMoLQkQLeMvHpDCchnQzMXMUOnAa) are highly obfuscated, which could be an attempt to conceal the purpose or make analysis more difficult. The code also uses nested try-except blocks for module import handling, which is standard but combined with obfuscated variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code's primary function is to set a version variable based on internal module imports. It uses obfuscated variable names, which may hinder readability but do not inherently indicate malicious intent. The try-except structure ensures robustness in version retrieval, providing a default string if import fails. No external network or data flow is observed, and no sensitive data handling occurs. The warnings are standard and relate only to installation issues. Overall, the code appears to serve a benign purpose, with obfuscation potentially used to hide internal details or discourage tampering.",
  "conclusion": "The code's functionality is limited to managing version information with obfuscated variables and standard exception handling. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or malicious code injections. The obfuscation is likely for concealment or to deter straightforward analysis but does not constitute malicious intent. Overall, the code appears safe.",
