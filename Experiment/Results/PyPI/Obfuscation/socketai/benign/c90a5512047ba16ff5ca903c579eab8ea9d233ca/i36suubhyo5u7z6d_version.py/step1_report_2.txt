  "purpose": "To set the version information for a Python package, attempting to import version data from internal modules, and falling back to a default value if unsuccessful.",
  "sources": "Import statements for internal modules _dev_version and _version; exception handling that captures ImportError and general Exception; fallback assignment of a default version string.",
  "sinks": "Assignment to the variable ysMTakVCVpXdkyzuprFnxILQgJLjtQxD; no other data sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Import attempts (source) → Exception handling (potential fallback) → Variable assignment (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names (__all__, ysMTakVCVpXdkyzuprFnxILQgJLjtQxD, EhyNKMoLQkQLeMvHpDCchnQzMXMUOnAa); use of try-except blocks with broad exception handling; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import version information from internal modules, which is typical for package versioning. The import statements are surrounded by nested try-except blocks, which handle missing modules gracefully by issuing a warning and defaulting the version to '0.0.0'. The use of obscure variable names and broad exception catching appears to be an attempt to obfuscate or complicate the code but does not directly indicate malicious intent. No network calls, data leaks, or malicious payloads are present. The code is solely for version management and error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code's purpose is standard version handling with obfuscated variable names and broad exception handling, which could suggest an attempt to conceal intent but does not contain malicious behavior. No malware or security risks are evident.",
