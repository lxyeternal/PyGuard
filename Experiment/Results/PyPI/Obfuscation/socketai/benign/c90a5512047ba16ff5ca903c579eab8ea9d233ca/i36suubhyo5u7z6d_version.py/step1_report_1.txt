{
  "purpose": "The code attempts to import version information from internal modules, or falls back to a default version string if import fails, issuing a warning.",
  "sources": "Import statements from ._dev_version and ._version modules, and the fallback assignment to a string '0.0.0'.",
  "sinks": "Assignment of the version string to a global variable; no direct sink of untrusted data or sensitive information.",
  "flows": "Import attempts from internal modules (sources) to setting version variable (sink); fallback to default string if imports fail.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated-looking variable names (ysMTakVCVpXdkyzuprFnxILQgJLjtQxD, EhyNKMoLQkQLeMvHpDCchnQzMXMUOnAa), which could suggest obfuscation or concealment, but no malicious code is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code uses nested try-except blocks to import version info from internal modules, with a fallback to a default string. The variable names are unusual and obfuscated, which could raise suspicion; however, they are only used for version handling. The code does not perform any malicious actions such as network activity, data leakage, or system modification. The warnings serve to inform about potential installation issues, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign attempt to handle version information with obfuscated variable names, which might suggest an attempt to conceal details, but there is no malicious behavior or security risk detected. The obfuscation alone is not sufficient to classify this as malware.",
