  "purpose": "The code attempts to determine the version of the package by importing from internal modules, and provides a fallback warning if it cannot do so.",
  "sources": "Import statements from _dev_version and _version modules; usage of warnings.warn; assignment to variable ysMTakVCVpXdkyzuprFnxILQgJLjtQxD",
  "sinks": "Warnings module output, variable assignment to ysMTakVCVpXdkyzuprFnxILQgJLjtQxD",
  "flows": "Import attempt -> fallback warning -> default version assignment",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated variable names (e.g., ysMTakVCVpXdkyzuprFnxILQgJLjtQxD), which could be a sign of obfuscation, but might also be just style. No direct malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code tries to import a version string from internal modules, catching ImportError to fallback gracefully, and other exceptions to warn the user. The variable names are intentionally obfuscated, which could be suspicious; however, there is no evidence of malicious activity. The warnings are standard practice for missing version info. No suspicious network or system actions are present. The logic appears to be for version management, with obfuscation potentially masking malicious intent but not necessarily indicating it.",
  "conclusion": "This code is primarily concerned with retrieving version information and handling failures gracefully. The obfuscated variable names could be an attempt to hide the intent but do not demonstrate malicious behavior. No malware or security risks are evident.",
