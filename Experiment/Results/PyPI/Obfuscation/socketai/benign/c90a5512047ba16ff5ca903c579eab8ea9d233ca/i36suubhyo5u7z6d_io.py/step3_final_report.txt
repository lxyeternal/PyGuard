{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for detecting file types via headers, decompressing gzip and zstandard compressed files, reading structured binary data, and streaming data blocks from files.",
  "sources": "File headers for format detection, file streams for decompression and data reading",
  "sinks": "Untrusted file input streams, data unpacking, and yielding data chunks",
  "flows": "File input -> header checks -> decompression streams -> binary unpacking -> data yielding",
  "anomalies": "Obscure variable names, no comments, handling multiple compression formats without validation, constants with unclear purpose",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard file format detection via signature bytes, applies appropriate decompression methods (gzip or zstandard), reads structured binary data, and yields data chunks. Variable names are intentionally obscure, but no malicious code, network activity, or backdoors are present. The functions include safety checks for file truncation and handle multiple compression formats dynamically. There is no evidence of code injection, data exfiltration, or sabotage. The obfuscation is limited to variable naming, not malicious code hiding techniques.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for handling compressed and structured binary files, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. Obfuscation is moderate but does not imply malicious intent. The security risk is low, and malware likelihood is negligible.",
