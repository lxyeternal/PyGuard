{
  "purpose": "The code defines static numeric variables and performs simple multiplications, with no external input, output, or malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "None; all variables are assigned static constants within the code.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; calculations are straightforward and self-contained.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are nonsensical and obfuscated, but this does not imply malicious intent; no malicious code or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of hardcoded numeric assignments and simple arithmetic operations. Variable names are obfuscated but do not indicate malicious behavior. There are no external data inputs, network activity, or system modifications. The obfuscation appears superficial, likely for placeholder or obfuscation purposes, not malicious concealment. The absence of malicious functions, data leaks, or external interactions confirms the benign nature of this code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing static calculations with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malware or security risks. The obfuscation is superficial and justified by variable naming. Overall, the code poses minimal security concern.",
