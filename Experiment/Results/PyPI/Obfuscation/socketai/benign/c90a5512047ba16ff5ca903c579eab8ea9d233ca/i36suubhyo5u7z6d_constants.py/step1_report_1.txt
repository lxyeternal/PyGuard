{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform simple mathematical operations with assigned variables, possibly for calculation or obfuscation.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; all variables are hardcoded constants.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "Variable assignments involve straightforward arithmetic with constants; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors detected. All variables are assigned static values, and calculations are simple multiplications.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several variables with numeric values, performs basic arithmetic operations, and assigns the results to other variables. There are no external inputs, no data leaks, no network operations, and no suspicious logic. The variable names are random and do not suggest malicious intent or obfuscation. Overall, the code is benign, likely used for straightforward calculations or placeholders.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It consists of simple, static variable assignments and calculations without any suspicious or malicious logic.",
