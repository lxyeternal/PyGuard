{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information and type annotations based on a conditional flag.",
  "sources": "The variable QFPCcBSJzypfDgOanBzCzyumDMRXumOq, which is a hardcoded boolean value.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no untrusted data output or system interaction.",
  "flows": "The flow depends on the boolean flag: if true, it imports types; otherwise, it assigns objects and strings.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names, but no malicious or suspicious operations detected. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a boolean flag and uses it to conditionally import typing constructs or assign generic objects. It sets version strings and tuple version representations. No data is read from external sources, nor are there any sinks or potentially dangerous operations. The variable names are intentionally obfuscated, but the code's logic is straightforward and benign. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The obfuscation appears superficial, possibly for code concealment rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple version and type annotation setup with obfuscated variable names. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The obfuscation is superficial and likely intended to hide variable purpose rather than conceal malicious activity.",
