{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define version information with conditional type annotations.",
  "sources": "The code reads the hardcoded boolean variable QFPCcBSJzypfDgOanBzCzyumDMRXumOq to determine the type annotation for version data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The boolean condition influences type annotations but does not involve untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses an obfuscated variable name for a boolean flag, which is unusual but not malicious. The conditional import and type annotation are common in version handling, with no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a boolean variable with a seemingly random name set to False. It conditionally imports typing and assigns a tuple type or a generic object type to a variable based on that boolean. It then assigns version information (major, minor, patch) to variables, with the version tuple also being assigned to the version variable. There is no input, no data processing, no output, and no suspicious behavior such as network activity, data leaks, or code injection. The obfuscated variable names are suspicious but can be a sign of code obfuscation rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily handling version data with obfuscated variable names. No malicious behavior, malicious payload, or security risks are evident.",
