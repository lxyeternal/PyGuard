  "purpose": "Defines version information with conditional type annotations, using obfuscated variable names for concealment.",
  "sources": "Reads no external input or data; assigns version strings and tuples internally.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data transmission or processing.",
  "flows": "Assignment of version strings and tuples; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Superficial obfuscation via variable names; conditional type hinting based on a boolean flag, which is unnecessary but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, setting version info with obfuscated variable names. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or external interactions are present. Obfuscation is superficial, likely for concealment, not malicious intent. The boolean flag controlling type hints is unusual but harmless. Scores assigned in reports (malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated ~0.5) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as version metadata with superficial obfuscation. No malicious activity or security vulnerabilities are evident. The obfuscation is not malicious but reduces readability. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
