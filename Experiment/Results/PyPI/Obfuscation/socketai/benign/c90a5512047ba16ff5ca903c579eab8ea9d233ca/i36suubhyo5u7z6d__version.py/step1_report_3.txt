  "purpose": "Define version information and type annotations based on a conditional flag.",
  "sources": "Variable assignment and conditional import statements.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data handling or output operations that could leak or manipulate untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Assignment of version string and tuple; conditional import affecting type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a conditional flag to dynamically determine type annotations; no direct malicious activity or obfuscation apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a boolean flag and uses it to conditionally set a type alias 'GqvIGlypexHiFhoUaFUZzECqeDGhYuhW' as either a Tuple of mixed types or a generic object. It then assigns version strings and a tuple representing version numbers. No input/output operations, network calls, or data handling involving untrusted sources are present. The structure appears to be for internal version management or compatibility handling without any suspicious or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign version and type annotation setup with no malicious behavior or security risks. It simply manages version info and type definitions, with no indication of malicious intent or anomalies.",
