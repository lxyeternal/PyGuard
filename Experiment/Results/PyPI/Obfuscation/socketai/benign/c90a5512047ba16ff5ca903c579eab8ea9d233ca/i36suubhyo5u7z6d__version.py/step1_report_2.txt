{
  "purpose": "The code defines version information for a Python package, with conditional type annotations based on a boolean flag.",
  "sources": "The code reads the boolean value 'QFPCcBSJzypfDgOanBzCzyumDMRXumOq' and assigns string and tuple variables related to version info.",
  "sinks": "No significant sinks where untrusted data flows into potentially dangerous operations are present.",
  "flows": "If the boolean flag is true, type annotations are imported and assigned; otherwise, variables are assigned a generic object type. The version tuple is assigned unconditionally.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a dynamic boolean condition to toggle type annotations is somewhat unusual but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a flag variable to False, then conditionally imports type annotations only if the flag is True. It then defines version-related variables, assigning a version tuple. The pattern suggests an attempt at optional type hinting or compatibility handling. There are no inputs, external data reads, or potentially dangerous operations. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious logic identified. The code appears to be standard version assignment logic with a conditional type hinting mechanism.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a version definition with optional type annotations controlled by a flag. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leaks, or security risks.",
