{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define version-related variables, potentially for a package or module, with conditional typing based on a boolean flag.",
  "sources": "The string assignments to variables 'ysMTakVCVpXdkyzuprFnxILQgJLjtQxD' and 'EhyNKMoLQkQLeMvHpDCchnQzMXMUOnAa', and the tuple 'version_tuple'.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is processed or transmitted to external sources or sinks.",
  "flows": "Assignment of static string values to variables, with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names, which makes understanding intent difficult; the conditional type hinting appears unnecessary but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a boolean flag 'QFPCcBSJzypfDgOanBzCzyumDMRXumOq' set to False. Based on this, it conditionally defines a type alias 'GqvIGlypexHiFhoUaFUZzECqeDGhYuhW' either as a Tuple of mixed ints and strings or as a generic object. It then assigns version strings and a version tuple to variables, with no indication of malicious behavior. Variable obfuscation complicates understanding, but there is no evidence of malicious activity, data leaks, or malicious code execution. No external data is read or written, and no suspicious functions are called.",
  "conclusion": "The code is obfuscated but appears to serve as version metadata initialization with no malicious intent or security risks. The obfuscation seems aimed at hindering readability rather than hiding malicious behavior.",
