  "purpose": "A minimal Python setup script that imports 'setup' from 'setuptools' and calls it with default parameters.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'setup' from 'setuptools'. No external data or input sources are used.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the script simply calls 'setup()' with no arguments.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard minimal setup for a Python package, importing 'setup' and executing it without parameters. It does not process external input, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and adherence to common packaging practices confirm its benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. All indicators point to a safe and standard package configuration.",
