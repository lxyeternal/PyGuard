{
  "purpose": "This code is used to set up and install a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the import statement 'from setuptools import setup' and the setup() function call.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function is a standard part of package configuration; it does not execute untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "No complex data flows are present; the code simply imports and calls setup() with default parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'setup' function from 'setuptools' and calls it with default parameters. This is a common pattern in Python package setup scripts and does not involve any input processing, data handling, or security-sensitive operations. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious logic, or data exfiltration. The script is minimal and standard for packaging purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for Python packaging with no malicious intent or security issues detected.",
