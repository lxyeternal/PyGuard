  "purpose": "Data parsing utilities for scientific or experimental binary data, extracting headers and data blocks into numpy arrays.",
  "sources": "Byte buffers representing headers and data blocks, read via functions like np.frombuffer and struct.unpack.",
  "sinks": "None; data is processed internally into numpy arrays, no external sinks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Header bytes are read, float values extracted via float unpacking, used as indices to select dtype lists, then data is converted into numpy arrays.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with nonsensical variable and function names; use of float conversions and string slicing to determine dtype indices; reliance on external constants and modules not provided.",
  "analysis": "The code performs binary data parsing with obfuscated identifiers, extracting float values from headers to select data types dynamically. No signs of malicious payloads, network activity, or system modification are present. The float extraction and slicing are unconventional but consistent with a domain-specific or obfuscation technique. The functions are typical for scientific data processing, and no external malicious behavior is evident. Obfuscation is notable but does not imply malicious intent. The malware score is appropriately zero; the obfuscation score is moderate to high, and the overall security risk is low.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, albeit obfuscated, data parsing utility used in scientific contexts. There is no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. Obfuscation may be for concealment or domain-specific reasons but does not constitute malicious intent. Scores reflect a low security threat with moderate obfuscation.",
