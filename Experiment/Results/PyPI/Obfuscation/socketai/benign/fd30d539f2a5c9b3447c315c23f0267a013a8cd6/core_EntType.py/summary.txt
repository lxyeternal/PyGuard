  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit active malicious behavior or payloads but relies on external data sources and uses obfuscated identifiers, which pose potential future security risks. The malware score is low, reflecting the absence of malicious payloads, but the obfuscation and external dependencies warrant a moderate security concern. Overall, the code appears to be a data utility with concealment features rather than malicious sabotage."
