  "purpose": "Assess the security implications of import statements from the 'gig.core' package with obfuscated identifiers to determine potential malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'gig.core.Ent', 'gig.core.EntType', 'gig.core.GIGTable', 'gig.core.GIGTableRow' modules.",
  "sinks": "No data flows, sinks, or data processing observed in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; only import statements are present without further code execution or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of class and module names, which could be used to conceal malicious intent, but no active malicious code or behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with heavily obfuscated class and module names, raising suspicion but not evidence of malicious activity. No data flows, network activity, or side effects are present. Malware scores are low (0 or 0.2), reflecting the absence of active malicious behavior. Obfuscation scores are high (around 0.8–0.9), correctly indicating the obscured identifiers. Risk scores are low (0.2), consistent with the lack of evidence for active threats. The scores across reports are appropriate given the limited context, and no further action is warranted without additional code demonstrating malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet appears benign but obfuscated. The current scores are justified; no active malicious activity is evident. Continued monitoring is recommended if subsequent code reveals suspicious behavior.",
