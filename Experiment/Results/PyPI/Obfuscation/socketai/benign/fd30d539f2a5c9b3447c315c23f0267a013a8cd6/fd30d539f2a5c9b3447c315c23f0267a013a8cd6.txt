      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate data retrieval component with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the potential for URL manipulation due to lack of input validation, which could be exploited if external inputs are maliciously controlled. The malware score is appropriate at 0, obfuscation is minimal (0.1), and the security risk is moderate (~0.5), reflecting the reliance on external data sources and dynamic URL formation without validation."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit active malicious behavior or payloads but relies on external data sources and uses obfuscated identifiers, which pose potential future security risks. The malware score is low, reflecting the absence of malicious payloads, but the obfuscation and external dependencies warrant a moderate security concern. Overall, the code appears to be a data utility with concealment features rather than malicious sabotage."

No confirmed malicious payloads are present, but caution is warranted for obfuscated and dynamic code segments."

The low malware and risk scores are appropriate, and the obfuscation alone does not justify high suspicion."

The code is safe and suitable for use; the high obfuscation score is justified but does not elevate the security risk."

Obfuscation warrants caution, but without active code or data flow, the overall security risk is minimal. Further analysis of the imported modules is recommended to confirm their benign or malicious nature."
