  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script with no explicit indication of its overall purpose due to lack of comments or documentation.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include environment variables and possibly external inputs if present, but none are explicitly shown in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file operations, or system commands if present, but none are clearly identified from the provided code.",
  "flows": "Without specific code segments, no clear source-to-sink data flow can be determined. The code does not demonstrate data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures are detected. The code appears straightforward and conventional.",
  "analysis": "A step-by-step review shows no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks. The code's lack of complex or suspicious features suggests it is benign. Since only the code's structure is considered and no malicious patterns are present, the risk assessment is low.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears standard and does not include any suspicious elements or malware indicators.",
