  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, user inputs, external modules, and network connections.",
  "sinks": "Network endpoints, file system, environment variables, and system commands that could leak data or be exploited.",
  "flows": "Input sources to sinks via dynamic execution, network communication, or data processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval, exec, obfuscated variable names, network activity, and complex control flow indicating potential obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits varying patterns across reports. Reports 1, 3, and 5 show minimal or no suspicious activity, with scores reflecting benign nature (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.2). Reports 2 and 4 indicate obfuscation and dynamic code execution, with Report 4 showing high suspicion due to network activity and complex obfuscation, warranting higher scores (malware≈0.7, obfuscated≈0.9, risk≈0.8). The scores are consistent with the described patterns, with no evidence of confirmed malicious payloads. The overall assessment suggests moderate risk primarily driven by obfuscation and dynamic features, but no definitive malware presence.",
  "conclusion": "The code reviews indicate low to moderate risk, with high suspicion only in reports describing obfuscation and network activity. Scores are justified by the patterns observed. No confirmed malicious payloads are present, but caution is warranted for obfuscated and dynamic code segments.",
