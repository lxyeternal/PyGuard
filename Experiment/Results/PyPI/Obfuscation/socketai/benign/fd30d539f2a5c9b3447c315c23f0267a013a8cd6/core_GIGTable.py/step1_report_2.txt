  "purpose": "Defines a data class for handling measurement and entity type data, with properties for URL construction, data fetching, and data transformation.",
  "sources": "Reading TSV data from a URL constructed from class properties, reading data from a file via FiledVariable, and class property inputs.",
  "sinks": "Data returned from WWW.readTSV(), data stored in instance variables, and data accessed via get() method.",
  "flows": "URL construction -> WWW.readTSV() -> list comprehension -> FiledVariable.value -> dictionary construction -> get() method accessing a class instance with data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic URL construction and file variable access, but no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious network activity. No suspicious backdoors or code injection evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a data class with several properties and cached properties that fetch and process TSV data from a constructed URL, which appears to be related to a data source or remote data fetching. The data is processed and stored in class variables, and there's a method to retrieve data objects by ID. The use of external modules (utils, gig.core) is standard, with no indication of malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are visible. The code structure is straightforward, and the URL construction appears intentional for data access rather than malicious purposes. Overall, no malicious intent or malware signatures detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate data handling class for remote TSV data fetching and processing, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
