  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate data retrieval component with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the potential for URL manipulation due to lack of input validation, which could be exploited if external inputs are maliciously controlled. The malware score is appropriate at 0, obfuscation is minimal (0.1), and the security risk is moderate (~0.5), reflecting the reliance on external data sources and dynamic URL formation without validation."
