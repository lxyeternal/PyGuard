{
  "purpose": "Defines a data class that processes measurement data, retrieves TSV data from a URL, and constructs objects based on the processed data.",
  "sources": "Reads URL from the zFLctcKlxWIhIdxSZIYYtLGmBGeymrIW property; reads data from WWW.readTSV(); reads from self.QDuNdSMykJliayefmvsFANuNxyuvEawS to access dictionary keys.",
  "sinks": "Uses WWW.readTSV() to fetch remote TSV data; accesses a possibly external URL; calls external class CHWNgFvvkhSypkfxmNGloLWNYGDQqflc with data from internal dictionary.",
  "flows": "self.zFLctcKlxWIhIdxSZIYYtLGmBGeymrIW → WWW.readTSV() → self.RHwKJztieDysJFtkXfAWmFswQHPdQgOv → self.QDuNdSMykJliayefmvsFANuNxyuvEawS → self.get() calling external class.",
  "anomalies": "The code constructs URLs dynamically; no explicit hardcoded secrets, but URL formation could potentially be manipulated if URL_BASE is externally controlled. Uses dynamic property evaluation and cached properties.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a data class with properties that generate a URL and fetch remote TSV data via WWW.readTSV(). It processes the data into lists and dictionaries. The dynamic URL construction and remote data fetching could be risky if URL_BASE is influenced externally. The code relies on external modules and classes, but no malicious behavior like data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors are evident. The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose of data retrieval and processing, with no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate and designed for data processing and retrieval. No malicious behavior detected. The main concern is dynamic URL formation which could be risky if URL_BASE is externally manipulated, but this alone does not indicate malicious intent.",
