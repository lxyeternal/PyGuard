  "conclusion": "The code appears benign in isolation but exhibits obfuscation patterns that warrant cautious monitoring. There is no concrete evidence of malicious activity, but the obfuscation and import placement could be used to conceal malicious behavior if combined with other code. Overall, the risk is low, but vigilance is advised."
