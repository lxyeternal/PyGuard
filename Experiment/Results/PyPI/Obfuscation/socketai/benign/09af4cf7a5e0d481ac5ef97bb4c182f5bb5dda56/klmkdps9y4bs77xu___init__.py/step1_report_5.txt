{
  "purpose": "The function appears to import a module named 'hook' from the same package, but the purpose of the function itself is not clear due to lack of implementation details.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the current package (import hook)",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows present in the provided code",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths identified in this snippet",
  "anomalies": "The function name 'qAQhXhTDIgfvCocIBCxpljhEGgNTgvTH' is obfuscated, which may suggest an attempt to hide intent. The code only contains a single import statement with no further logic or data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function with an obfuscated name and imports a module named 'hook' from the same package. There are no other statements, data processing, or behavior observed. The import alone is not suspicious, but combined with the obfuscated function name, it raises suspicion of possible hiding of malicious behavior or obfuscation of intent. Since the code is minimal, it cannot be definitively malicious but warrants caution due to obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal and contains an obfuscated function name with a simple import statement. This pattern can be used to hide malicious intent or to complicate analysis. There are no explicit malicious actions or data leaks visible, but the obfuscation suggests potential concealment. Overall, the risk is moderate, and further context is needed for a definitive assessment.",
