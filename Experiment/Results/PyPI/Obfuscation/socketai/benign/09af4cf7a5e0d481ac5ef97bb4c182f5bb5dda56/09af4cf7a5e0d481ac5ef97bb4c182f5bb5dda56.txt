      "conclusion": "The code appears benign in isolation but exhibits obfuscation patterns that warrant cautious monitoring. There is no concrete evidence of malicious activity, but the obfuscation and import placement could be used to conceal malicious behavior if combined with other code. Overall, the risk is low, but vigilance is advised."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Django transaction signal handler with dynamic import features that could be exploited if inputs are untrusted. No evidence of malicious activity or malware is present. The main concern is the potential misuse of dynamic import if parameters are influenced externally, but as provided, it does not exhibit malicious behavior."
