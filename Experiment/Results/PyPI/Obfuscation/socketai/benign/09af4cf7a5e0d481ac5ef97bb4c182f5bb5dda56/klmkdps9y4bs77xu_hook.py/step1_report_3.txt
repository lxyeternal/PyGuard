{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom Django database transaction signals and hooks into Django's transaction lifecycle to emit signals before and after commit, rollback, and transaction management events.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration and module import data, as well as Django connection and transaction states, but does not process external input or untrusted data directly.",
  "sinks": "Signals are emitted during transaction events; dynamic module import and function wrapping are performed. No data is sent over the network, nor are system files accessed or modified.",
  "flows": "The code flows from transaction lifecycle events (commit, rollback, management) to signal emission, and includes dynamic import and function wrapping which could potentially execute arbitrary code if module names are controlled externally.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of dynamic import and wrapping functions that modify existing methods at runtime; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious URLs. The code does not perform any data leakage or malicious system access directly.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily extends Django's transaction signal system, wrapping existing methods to emit custom signals before and after transaction events. It employs dynamic module import and function wrapping, which could be misused if module names are externally controlled, but in standard usage, it simply hooks into Django's transaction lifecycle. No suspicious or malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, system modification, or network communication are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to expected Django patterns, with no obfuscated code or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate extension of Django's transaction signal system, with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It does utilize dynamic import and method wrapping, which are potentially dangerous if misused, but as written, it appears safe and purpose-specific.",
