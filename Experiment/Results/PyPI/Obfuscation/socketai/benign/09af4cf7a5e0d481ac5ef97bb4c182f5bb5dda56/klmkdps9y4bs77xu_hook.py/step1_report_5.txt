{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom Django signals for transaction management events and decorates transaction functions to emit these signals at appropriate points.",
  "sources": "The code reads module imports, Django version, transaction status via 'transaction.is_managed', and dynamically imported modules/functions.",
  "sinks": "Signals are sent via 'signals.pre_*', 'signals.post_*', and 'aewSuiwhAsKVuPpQzSkWIBqisLRiVYmV' function calls which invoke signal handlers.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., transaction status, module paths) triggers signal emission before and after transaction events, potentially passing context data to handlers.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses dynamic import and decorator wrapping with potentially imported functions without clear validation, but no malicious or suspicious activity like data exfiltration, system commands, or backdoors are evident. The signal setup is standard for Django custom signals.",
  "analysis": "The script establishes custom Django signals for transaction management events, wraps existing transaction functions with decorators that emit signals before and after critical points such as commit, rollback, and transaction management. It dynamically imports modules and functions for wrapping but does not perform unsafe operations like executing system commands or network connections. The code appears to facilitate observability of transaction events, which can be useful for logging, auditing, or extension. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. The use of dynamic import and signal emission is standard in Django extensions and does not suggest malicious intent. Overall, the code shows no evidence of malware or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily sets up Django signals and wraps transaction functions to emit these signals at specific points. It does not contain malicious or suspicious activities; it appears to be a standard extension for observability or custom handling within Django transactions. No malware or security risks are identified.",
