{
  "purpose": "Minimal Python module importing obfuscated symbols, defining an __all__ list, and setting a version/date string.",
  "sources": "Import statement from local module '.core', variable assignment of a date string.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, network, or environment interactions observed.",
  "flows": "Import from '.core' (source) to module namespace; no data flow to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated symbol names and a future date string ('2025.04.26') are unusual but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, with obfuscated identifiers and a static date string. No network, file, or environment activity is present. The import is from a local module, and no data flows or malicious behaviors are evident. The obfuscation may be intentional or auto-generated, but without active malicious code, the risk remains low. The date string is suspicious but harmless in isolation. The malware score is correctly zero; obfuscation is moderate, and overall security risk is minimal.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with obfuscated naming and a future date string, but no malicious activity or vulnerabilities. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
