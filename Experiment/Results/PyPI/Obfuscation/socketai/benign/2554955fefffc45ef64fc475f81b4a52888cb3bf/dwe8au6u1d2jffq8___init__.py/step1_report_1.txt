{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that imports specific symbols from a local core module and defines a list of public objects, along with a version or date string.",
  "sources": "The code reads the local module '.core' to import two objects: IqmADcXwuMEllMJHmPKpGyJKiZbGcNRD and eEIZTSASukfoEiKQrOxLyVaXXFyVXJcv.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; no network, file, or environment variable operations are present.",
  "flows": "The imported symbols are not used or manipulated further, and the version string is static; no data flow from input to output is observable.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated-looking variable and function names; a version/date string set to a future date ('2025.04.26') which could be suspicious if used for version control or checks; no actual malicious code or backdoors apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific symbols from a relative module, which could be a sign of obfuscation or just a coding style. The use of cryptic variable names and a future date string may suggest intentional concealment or preparation for future checks, but there is no active malicious behavior such as network activity, code execution, or data leaks. The code is minimal and does not perform any harmful actions. No suspicious imports or obfuscated code patterns are evident beyond naming conventions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple module with obfuscated variable names and a future date string, with no active malicious or security-threatening behavior. It does not contain malware or malicious logic, and the security risk is minimal.",
