{
  "purpose": "The code dynamically retrieves the path to a 'cacert.pem' file from the 'certifi' package, depending on the Python version, to provide SSL certificates for secure connections.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'cacert.pem' file from the 'certifi' package resources or local filesystem, depending on Python version.",
  "sinks": "The path to 'cacert.pem' is returned and potentially used elsewhere in the application for SSL/TLS configurations.",
  "flows": "The code flow reads resource locations via importlib.resources or filesystem, then returns the path as a string for use in SSL context setup.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic resource fetching with caching and registration of cleanup functions via atexit. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code appears to serve a benign purpose of providing SSL certificates.",
  "analysis": "The code adjusts its approach based on Python version, fetching 'cacert.pem' from package resources or local directory. It uses caching to avoid repeated resource lookups and registers a cleanup function with atexit. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected; the functions perform straightforward resource access and path resolution without any hidden or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for dynamically obtaining SSL certificate files depending on Python version. No malicious or suspicious activity is present. It appears safe and focused solely on resource management.",
