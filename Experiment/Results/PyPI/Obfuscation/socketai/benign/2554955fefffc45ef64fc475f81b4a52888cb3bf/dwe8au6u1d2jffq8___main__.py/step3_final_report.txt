{
  "purpose": "The code imports obfuscated variables/functions from 'certifi' and executes one based on a command-line flag, potentially hiding malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Input from command-line argument '--contents'; import statements from 'certifi' with nonsensical identifiers.",
  "sinks": "Execution of imported identifiers as functions or printing their values based on user input.",
  "flows": "Command-line input triggers conditional execution; imported identifiers are called or printed depending on the flag.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated import names from 'certifi'; dynamic execution without validation; nonsensical identifiers not matching standard 'certifi' API.",
  "analysis": "The code's obfuscated import from 'certifi' and conditional execution pattern are suspicious, suggesting potential concealment of malicious activity. No direct malicious actions (network, file, or data exfiltration) are visible, but the obfuscation and dynamic execution pose security risks. The high obfuscation score (~0.8) is justified, and malware likelihood (~0.6) is moderate given the suspicious pattern but lacks concrete evidence. The risk score (~0.6) reflects the potential danger due to obfuscation and unvalidated execution. Scores are consistent with the suspicion level, but further analysis of the imported identifiers is necessary to confirm malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation and suspicious import patterns, which could conceal malicious behavior. While no direct malicious activity is confirmed, the pattern warrants caution. The overall security risk is moderate to high, with a malware score around 0.6, and obfuscation score at 0.8. Further investigation into the imported identifiers is recommended before deployment or use.",
