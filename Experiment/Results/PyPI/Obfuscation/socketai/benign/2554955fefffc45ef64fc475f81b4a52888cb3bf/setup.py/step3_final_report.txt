  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script that extracts version info from 'certifi/__init__.py' and configures package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads 'certifi/__init__.py' file to extract version string using regex.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external network calls or data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from file (source) and passes metadata to setup() (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; regex pattern is straightforward but variable names are intentionally obscure.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical package setup tasks: importing setup, reading version info via regex, and calling setup() with package metadata. The obfuscated variable names are unusual but do not indicate malicious intent. No external data, network activity, or code execution beyond standard setup procedures is present. The regex is simple and used solely for version extraction. No hardcoded credentials or malicious payloads are evident. The obfuscation appears superficial, possibly for concealment, but does not constitute malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, standard package setup script with obfuscated variable names. No malicious activity or security risks are detected. The obfuscation does not imply malicious intent, and the code functions as intended for package configuration.",
