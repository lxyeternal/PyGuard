  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The script performs standard package setup with obfuscated variable names and regex to extract version info. No malicious activity or external data flows are evident.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0.2, Obfuscated=0.7, Confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The obfuscation is likely an attempt to conceal, but the code functions as a typical setup script. No malware or malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with standard package setup, obfuscated variable names, straightforward regex, no external data or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0.1, Obfuscated=0.7, Confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious intent; obfuscation appears cosmetic.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same pattern—standard setup, obfuscated variables, regex for version extraction, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0.2, Obfuscated=0.7, Confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior; code appears legitimate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Again, standard setup script with obfuscated variable names, regex for version, no external or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0, Obfuscated=0.7, Confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity; obfuscation likely for concealment.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above—standard package setup, obfuscated variables, regex, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0.2, Obfuscated=0.7, Confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** No malware or malicious intent detected.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Code Functionality:** All reports confirm that the code is a standard Python package setup script with obfuscated variable names and regex to extract version info.\n- **Malware & Security Risks:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious activity. Security risk scores are low, reflecting the benign nature of the script.\n- **Obfuscation:** The variable names are intentionally obscure, but this does not translate into malicious intent. It might be an attempt to conceal or deter casual inspection.\n- **External Data/Flows:** No external network activity, untrusted input processing, or data leaks are evident.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The obfuscation alone does not imply malicious activity; it is common in some codebases for various reasons, including obfuscation or code generation.\n- The regex pattern is straightforward and used solely for version extraction.\n- The code performs standard package setup tasks without executing untrusted code or external network calls.\n- No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malware indicators are present.\n\n### Recommended Scores:\n- **Malware:** **0** (consistent across all reports; no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0.7** (variable names are obfuscated, but this is not malicious)\n- **Risk Score:** **0.2** (low, reflecting minimal security concern; primarily obfuscation)\n\n---\n\n### Final conclusion:\nThe code is a typical, legitimate Python package setup script with obfuscated variable names that do not indicate malicious intent. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**\n- Malware score: **0**\n- Obfuscated score: **0.7**\n- Overall security risk: **0.2**\n\nThis assessment aligns with the detailed reports and the analysis of the code's behavior.",
