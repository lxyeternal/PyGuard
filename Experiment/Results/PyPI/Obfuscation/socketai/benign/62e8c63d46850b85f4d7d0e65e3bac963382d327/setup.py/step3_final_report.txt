  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script that reads dependencies from 'requirements.txt' and package description from 'README.md' for packaging a Python project.",
  "sources": "Reads 'requirements.txt' for dependencies and 'README.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data leads to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "File contents are read and passed into setup() parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function name 'XPBkodaumQCWClDqkJsoXzrwYheikvgQ' which only reads files; no malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with an obfuscated function that reads lines from a file, filtering out comments and blank lines. No network activity, code injection, or malicious behavior is present. The obfuscation appears unnecessary but benign. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are found. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, with the main concern being the non-descriptive function name. The malware score remains at 0, and the security risk is low, consistent with the benign behavior. The obfuscation is suspicious but not malicious, warranting a moderate obfuscated score.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with obfuscated naming. No malicious activity or supply chain threats are evident. The obfuscation does not impact security but could be improved for clarity. The overall security assessment is that the package is safe to use.",
