{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package, including reading a requirements file and README for metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'requirements.txt' file and 'README.md' file.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed in a malicious manner.",
  "flows": "Reading data from files and passing them into setup() parameters; no flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The function name 'XPBkodaumQCWClDqkJsoXzrwYheikvgQ' is obfuscated and does not indicate its purpose. The code reads requirements from a file without validation. No explicit malicious code or backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily reads a list of dependencies from 'requirements.txt' and package metadata from 'README.md'. The function name is obfuscated but the logic is straightforward file reading. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or malicious behavior is detected. The structure and content align with a typical setup.py script, with no hidden or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate package setup script with obfuscated function naming. No malicious activity or supply chain threats are evident. The obfuscation might be unnecessary but does not indicate malicious intent.",
