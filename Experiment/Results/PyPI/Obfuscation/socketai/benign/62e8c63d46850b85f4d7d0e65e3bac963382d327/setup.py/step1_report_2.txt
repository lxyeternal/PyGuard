{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package, used to specify package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'requirements.txt' file for dependencies and the 'README.md' file for the long description.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data influences sensitive operations such as network communication, file manipulation beyond reading, or system commands.",
  "flows": "The dependencies listed in 'requirements.txt' are read and passed to the 'install_requires' parameter during setup, and 'README.md' content is read for description; no data is transmitted or executed beyond file reading.",
  "anomalies": "The function name 'XPBkodaumQCWClDqkJsoXzrwYheikvgQ' is non-descriptive and appears obfuscated, but it only performs safe file reading. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup operations. It reads a requirements file and a README file without executing any code from these files. The obfuscated function is used solely for reading a file's lines, which is benign. No network connections, code injections, or malicious behaviors are detected. The overall structure is typical for a Python package setup script, with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python module. Despite the obfuscated function name, it only reads files and does not contain any malicious behavior. The package appears safe and typical for distribution.",
