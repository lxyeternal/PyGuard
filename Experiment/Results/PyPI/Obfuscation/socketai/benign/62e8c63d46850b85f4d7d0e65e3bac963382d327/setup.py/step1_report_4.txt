{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package, reading dependencies from a requirements file and preparing metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from 'requirements.txt' and 'README.md' files.",
  "kills": "No untrusted or user-supplied data sources are explicitly present. The code does not process external inputs during runtime.",
  "flows": "The function 'XPBkodaumQCWClDqkJsoXzrwYheikvgQ' reads and processes 'requirements.txt' into a list of dependencies, which are then passed to the setup function.",
  "anomalies": "The function name 'XPBkodaumQCWClDqkJsoXzrwYheikvgQ' is non-descriptive and appears obfuscated. The variable names are also non-meaningful, which could be an attempt to hide intent. However, the function only reads and processes a file, not executing code or data manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py used for package distribution. It includes a custom function to read dependencies from a file, which appears benign. No code injections, network activity, or malicious behaviors are present. The obfuscated naming might be suspicious, but it does not necessarily indicate malicious activity; it could be an attempt to conceal code complexity. There are no indications of backdoors, data exfiltration, or harmful system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script with obfuscated function names, which is suspicious but not malicious in behavior. There is no evidence of malware or malicious intent based on the provided code.",
