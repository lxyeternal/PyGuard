  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for a Python package, including reading dependencies and long description.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'requirements.txt' file for dependencies, reading 'README.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted external data or perform actions on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "The 'requirements.txt' file content is read and passed to 'install_requires' in setup.",
  "anomalies": "Function name 'XPBkodaumQCWClDqkJsoXzrwYheikvgQ' appears obfuscated, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets or credentials observed. The code uses a standard setup pattern.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a function that reads and filters lines from a specified file, ignoring comments. It reads 'requirements.txt' and 'README.md' for package description and dependencies, then invokes 'setup' with package metadata. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The obfuscated function name could be an attempt to hide intent, but it only reads a file. No network activity, code execution, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script for a Python package with an obfuscated function name. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected. The obfuscation could be an attempt to conceal the purpose, but it does not perform malicious actions.",
