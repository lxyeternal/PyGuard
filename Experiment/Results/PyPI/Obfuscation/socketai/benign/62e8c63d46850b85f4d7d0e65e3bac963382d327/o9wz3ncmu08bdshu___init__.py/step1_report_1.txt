  "purpose": "Import specific functions or classes from local modules for use within the package.",
  "sources": "Import statements referencing local modules: process_emulator, logger, sim, tuner.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data; no external data flows or network calls are present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; only static imports without data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "The imported identifiers are non-descriptive and appear as random strings, which is unusual for clear code semantics but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains import statements from local modules using non-standard, seemingly random identifiers as imported symbols. No other code or logic is present to analyze. The use of obscured names may suggest an attempt to hide functionality, but it could also be a naming convention. There are no visible network operations, data handling, or suspicious behavior. Since these are local imports, there is no external data flow or supply chain risk evident in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is limited to import statements with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks based on this fragment alone. The unusual naming may be a form of obfuscation or simply a naming convention, but without further code, no malicious activity can be determined.",
