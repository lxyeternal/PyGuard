  "purpose": "Import specific modules or functions from local package components",
  "sources": "Import statements referencing local modules: process_emulator, logger, sim, tuner",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks present; import statements generally do not pose direct risks",
  "flows": "No data flows observed; these are simple import statements",
  "anomalies": "Imported identifiers are obfuscated or non-descriptive, which is unusual but not inherently malicious; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code contains four import statements from local modules with seemingly obfuscated function or class names. The naming appears intentionally obscure, which could be a technique to hide malicious intent or simply obfuscation. There are no other code constructs, data handling, or execution flows present. Without additional context or code, these imports alone do not indicate malicious behavior. The absence of data processing, network operations, or system modifications suggests low likelihood of malicious activity in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists solely of import statements with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malicious data flow, or security risks based solely on this snippet. The obfuscation might be suspicious but does not confirm malicious intent. Further review of the imported modules would be necessary to definitively assess security risk.",
