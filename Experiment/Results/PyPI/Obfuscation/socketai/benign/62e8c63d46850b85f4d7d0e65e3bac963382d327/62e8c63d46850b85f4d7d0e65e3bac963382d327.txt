Obfuscation alone does not imply malicious intent, and the current evidence supports a low security threat level. Further analysis of the imported modules is advised for complete assurance."

Obfuscation is likely stylistic or for code management rather than malicious concealment. Proper security practices should be maintained, but the overall security risk is minimal."

The high obfuscation warrants caution, but the core functionality is consistent with standard industrial automation tasks. No signs of malware or supply chain sabotage are present."

External 'common' module dependencies should be reviewed in a supply chain context, but within this analysis, the code is safe."

The malware score should be 0, obfuscation around 0.7, and security risk approximately 0.2, reflecting the code's complexity but benign nature."
