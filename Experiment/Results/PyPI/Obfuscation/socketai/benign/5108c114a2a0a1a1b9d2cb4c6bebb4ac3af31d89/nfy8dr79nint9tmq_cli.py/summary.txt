  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate CLI tool for Helium API interaction but employs obfuscation and dynamic module loading that could conceal malicious intent. Without further inspection of imported modules or runtime behavior, a cautious but not alarmist stance is justified. The current scores are consistent with the observed code structure and potential risks."
