{
  "purpose": "The code provides utilities for serializing data into JSON, CSV, and ASCII table formats, primarily for reporting or display purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads data from input parameters, environment variables (e.g., 'COLUMNS'), and files provided during instantiation.",
  "sinks": "Writes serialized data to file streams or terminal output; no network or system modification observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through formatting functions, possibly involving sorting and mapping, then to output streams or files.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and class names, which hinder readability but do not indicate malicious intent; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code employs obfuscated identifiers but performs standard data serialization and display functions. It does not contain network calls, data exfiltration, or system modifications. The obfuscation appears superficial, likely intended to hinder analysis rather than conceal malicious activity. No malicious patterns or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code's purpose aligns with benign data formatting utilities, and the environment interactions are limited to formatting parameters and environment variables for display purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate data serialization and display utility with superficial obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation may be to hinder readability but does not indicate malicious intent.",
