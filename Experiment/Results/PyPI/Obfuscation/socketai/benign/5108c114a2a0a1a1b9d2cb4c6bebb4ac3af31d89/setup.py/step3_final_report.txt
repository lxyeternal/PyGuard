  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for a Python package, defining metadata, dependencies, and reading a README file for long description.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file; variables assigned package info and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or external network interactions observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file reading into setup parameters; no external or untrusted data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated variable names; incomplete or malformed 'setup()' call (missing or improperly formatted 'entry_points').",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names, likely to hide details. It reads a README file, sets dependencies, and calls 'setup()' with metadata. The 'setup()' call appears incomplete or malformed, which could be a bug or intentional obfuscation. No malicious code, network activity, or malicious payloads are present. The obfuscation is superficial, primarily variable renaming, not malicious code obfuscation. The absence of network activity, code execution, or data exfiltration indicates no malicious intent. The incomplete setup is a concern but not evidence of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, obfuscated 'setup.py' with no malicious activity detected. The obfuscation is superficial and likely stylistic or accidental. The incomplete 'setup()' call should be corrected for proper functionality but does not imply malicious intent.",
