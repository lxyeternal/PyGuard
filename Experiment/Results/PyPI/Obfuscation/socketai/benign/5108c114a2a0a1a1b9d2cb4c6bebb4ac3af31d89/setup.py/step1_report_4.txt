  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named helium-python, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file, variable assignments, and the setup() function call.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function call, which could execute package installation or configuration, but no direct untrusted data handling is visible.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md → setup() function call with parameters, but no untrusted data passed into setup.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names, incomplete setup() function call (missing closing parentheses or parameters), and no actual execution of malicious code. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors evident. The code is straightforward and resembles a typical setup script, with some obfuscation in variable names.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools, defines several variables with obfuscated names, reads a README.md file, and calls setup() with package metadata. The setup() call appears incomplete, missing parameters such as 'name', 'version', and possibly closing parentheses. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection. The obfuscated variables may be intended to hide the package name and author email but do not directly indicate malicious intent. The code structure is consistent with a standard setup.py script, but the incomplete setup() call raises questions about whether the script is intentionally tampered or incomplete.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names, likely to obscure details such as package name and email. No malicious behaviors or malware indicators are present. The main concern is the incomplete setup() invocation, which could indicate code tampering or an incomplete package. Overall, low confidence in malicious intent, but the code warrants review for completeness.",
