  "purpose": "CLI utility functions for sorting, filtering, and resource handling with obfuscated variable and function names.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for sorting choices, resource identifiers, JSON strings, and file paths.",
  "sinks": "JSON parsing, file reading, and CLI parameter handling; no direct data leaks or malicious effects observed.",
  "flows": "Input data (choices, resource identifiers, JSON strings) are processed through functions that parse and handle resources, with no evidence of malicious data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names, use of '@' notation for file input, standard JSON parsing with exception handling; no malicious code or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily CLI argument parsing and resource management routines, with obfuscated identifiers but no malicious behavior. JSON parsing is handled safely, and no network or system modification routines are present. The obfuscation appears superficial, not indicative of malicious intent. Scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, low security risk, moderate obfuscation) are consistent with the benign analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI utility with obfuscated naming but no malicious or security-threatening behavior. The current scores are appropriate, with malware score at 0, low security risk, and moderate obfuscation. No further action is necessary.",
