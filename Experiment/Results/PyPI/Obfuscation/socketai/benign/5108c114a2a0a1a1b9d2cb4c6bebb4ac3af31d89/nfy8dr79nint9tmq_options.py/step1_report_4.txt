{
  "purpose": "This code defines command-line interface options and parameter types for a CLI tool, including sorting, filtering, and resource handling.",
  "sources": "Input sources include command-line arguments, environment variables (indirectly), and files read via '@' syntax.",
  "sinks": "Data processed through JSON loading, file reading, and parameter parsing functions; no direct data leakage observed.",
  "flows": "Command-line inputs flow into parameter parsing functions, some are loaded from files, then used within CLI context; no untrusted data directly leads to system-level actions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets or unusual code constructs. Parameter class for resources handles file input, which is typical. No obfuscated or suspicious code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements CLI options with click, including sorting, metadata filtering, and resource specification. Functions handle input parsing, including reading from files via '@' syntax. JSON parsing is done safely with error handling. No code injection, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behaviors are present. The code structure appears standard for CLI argument processing. There are no signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious system actions.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard CLI parameter parsing with no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It appears safe and typical for CLI tools, with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
