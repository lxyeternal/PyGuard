  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing the findings with the original code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Original Code Recap:**\n```python\nfrom __future__ import unicode_literals\nfrom helium import Device\nDevice\n```\n- The code imports a future feature for Unicode string literals.\n- It imports the `Device` class from the `helium` library.\n- It references `Device` but does not instantiate or invoke it.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n**Summary:**\n- Finds the code benign, no malicious behavior, no data flows, no anomalies.\n- Confident at 0.9.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Security risk: 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Correctly identifies the code as benign; no issues present.\n- The reasoning is sound; the code is a minimal fragment with no suspicious activity.\n- The low security risk score is appropriate given the minimal nature.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n**Summary:**\n- Also finds the code benign, with no evident malicious activity.\n- Slightly lower confidence at 0.7.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Security risk: 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Correctly notes that the code is minimal and likely harmless.\n- The potential concern about `Device` instantiation is mitigated since it's not instantiated here.\n- The security risk remains low.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n**Summary:**\n- Notes that `Device` is only referenced, not instantiated or used.\n- Considers this unusual but not malicious.\n- Confidence at 0.8.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Security risk: 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Accurate; referencing but not using `Device` is benign.\n- No issues here.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n**Summary:**\n- Similar to previous, references `Device` without instantiation.\n- Confirms the code is likely a fragment.\n- Confidence at 0.5.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Security risk: 0.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Correct; no malicious activity detected.\n- The security risk is minimal.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n**Summary:**\n- Finds the code benign, straightforward, no suspicious behavior.\n- Confidence at 0.9.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Security risk: 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Consistent with previous analyses.\n- No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, minimal, and does not contain malicious activity.\n- The malware scores are all zero, which is appropriate.\n- The security risk scores are low, reflecting the code's minimal and benign nature.\n- The references to `Device` without instantiation are noted but not suspicious.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- The code snippet is very minimal and appears to be part of a larger script.\n- There is no evidence of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns.\n- The `helium` library is known for web automation; referencing `Device` alone does not imply malicious intent.\n- The code does not perform any network, file, or data processing.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, given the minimal code and benign context)\n\n**Rationale:**\n- The code is a benign fragment, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The references to `Device` are not malicious; they are likely preparatory or incomplete code.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- **Overall malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Security risk score:** 0.1\n\nThis assessment aligns with all reports and the code's content.",
