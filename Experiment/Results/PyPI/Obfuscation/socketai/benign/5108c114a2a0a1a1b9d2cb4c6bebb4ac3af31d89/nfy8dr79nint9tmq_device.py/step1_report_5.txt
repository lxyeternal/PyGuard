{
  "purpose": "The code appears to import future Unicode compatibility and the 'Device' class from the 'helium' library, then instantiates 'Device'.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'helium' library, instantiation of 'Device'.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only performs a simple import and instantiation.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no suspicious or unusual behavior. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a future feature for Unicode support and imports the 'Device' class from the 'helium' library, which is used for browser automation. It then creates an instance of 'Device'. There are no external data inputs, network operations, or other suspicious activities. The code appears to be part of a larger script intended for automation purposes but alone does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, simple, and does not contain any malicious or suspicious elements. It merely sets up a 'Device' object from the 'helium' library, with no indicators of malware or security threats.",
