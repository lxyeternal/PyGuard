{
  "purpose": "The code appears to import a feature for unicode string literals and imports a 'Device' class or object from the 'helium' library, then references 'Device'.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the import statements and the 'Device' reference.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data processing points are present.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code only imports and references 'Device' with no further actions.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and does not perform any operations; 'Device' is referenced but not instantiated or used, which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains import statements and a reference to 'Device'. No data processing, input reading, or output occurs. The import of '__future__.unicode_literals' is typical for Python 2/3 compatibility, and the 'helium' library is a known web automation library. The reference to 'Device' may be part of a larger script; on its own, it is benign but incomplete. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious code segments. The code's minimal nature does not suggest malicious intent, but it is incomplete.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and appears to be a fragment of a larger script. There is no malicious behavior detected. Its minimal nature does not raise security concerns on its own.",
