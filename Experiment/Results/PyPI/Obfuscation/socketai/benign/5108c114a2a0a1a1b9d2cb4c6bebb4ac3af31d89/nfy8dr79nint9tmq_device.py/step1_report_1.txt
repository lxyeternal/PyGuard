{
  "purpose": "The code appears to import a future feature for unicode literals and imports a class 'Device' from the 'helium' library, then references 'Device' likely for instantiation or usage.",
  "sources": "The source of data is not explicitly present in the code; it imports a class and references it, but no input or data reading occurs within this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present in this snippet; there are no untrusted data handling, network operations, or file operations.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code only imports and references a class without further data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns are detected. The code is minimal and standard in structure.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a future feature for unicode string literals and then imports and references 'Device' from the 'helium' library. It does not instantiate or call any methods on 'Device', nor does it perform any actions. The snippet is very short and appears to be a fragment of a larger program. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and standard, with no signs of malware, malicious intent, or security risks. It appears to be a fragment intended to use the 'Device' class from 'helium' in a larger context.",
