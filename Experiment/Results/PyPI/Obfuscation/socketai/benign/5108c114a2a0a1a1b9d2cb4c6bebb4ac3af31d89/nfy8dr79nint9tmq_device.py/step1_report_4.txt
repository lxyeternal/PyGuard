{
  "purpose": "The code imports the 'unicode_literals' feature from __future__ and references the 'Device' class from the helium library, likely for automation or testing purposes.",
  "sources": "The code imports __future__ for compatibility and reads the 'Device' class from the helium library.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or harmful effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows or interactions are present beyond the import statement and the 'Device' reference.",
  "anomalies": "The code references 'Device' without instantiation or further use, which is unusual but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a compatibility import and a class reference from an external library. There are no operations, functions, or data handling present. The reference to 'Device' without usage may be incomplete or placeholder code, but on its own, it does not indicate malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a minimal fragment, likely part of a larger script. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code's purpose seems to be to prepare for or declare usage of 'Device' from helium, but without further context, it remains benign.",
