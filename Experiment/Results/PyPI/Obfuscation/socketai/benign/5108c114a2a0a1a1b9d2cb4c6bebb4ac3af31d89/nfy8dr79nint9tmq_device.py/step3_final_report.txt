{
  "purpose": "The code imports the 'Device' class from the 'helium' library and references it, likely as part of a larger script.",
  "sources": "Import statement from __future__ and the import of 'Device' from 'helium'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, no data processing, no network or file operations.",
  "flows": "Import source to reference of 'Device'; no further data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "Reference to 'Device' without instantiation or method invocation; minimal code fragment; no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, benign fragment importing a class and referencing it without further action. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The code does not perform any data handling, network activity, or obfuscation. The references to 'Device' are likely placeholders or part of a larger context. The security risk is very low, and the malware likelihood is negligible.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
