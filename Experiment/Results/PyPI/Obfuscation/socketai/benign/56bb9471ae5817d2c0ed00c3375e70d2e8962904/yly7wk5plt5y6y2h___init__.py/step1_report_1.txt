  "purpose": "Import a specific symbol from the 'skranger._version' module, likely related to version information.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'skranger._version' module.",
  "sinks": "None directly present; no data output or external interaction in this snippet.",
  "flows": "N/A, as the code only imports a symbol without executing further actions.",
  "anomalies": "The imported symbol 'TbHIRNViDmUPISDnORTTEZYEopIYDSTv' appears to be a random or obfuscated name, which may indicate code obfuscation or malicious intent. No other anomalies detected in this isolated statement.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific symbol with a highly unusual, seemingly random name from a submodule. This could be legitimate if the symbol is intentionally named, but such naming is often associated with obfuscated or malicious code to hide intent. There are no other operations or data flows, and the import alone does not pose a direct threat. However, the suspicious symbol name warrants caution as it might be used for covert actions elsewhere.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement's unusual symbol name raises suspicion of obfuscation, which could be a tactic used in malicious code. No direct malicious activity is evident, but the potential for hidden intent exists. Further context from the module or additional code is necessary for a definitive assessment.",
