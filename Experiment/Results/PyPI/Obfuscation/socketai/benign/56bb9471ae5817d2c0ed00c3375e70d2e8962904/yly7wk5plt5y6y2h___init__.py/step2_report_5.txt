  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n**Original Code:**\n```python\nfrom skranger._version import TbHIRNViDmUPISDnORTTEZYEopIYDSTv\n```\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code performs a straightforward import of a symbol named `TbHIRNViDmUPISDnORTTEZYEopIYDSTv` from the internal module `skranger._version`.\n- The symbol name appears highly obfuscated or randomly generated, which is unusual for typical version or internal identifiers.\n\n### Logical Flaws or Mistakes:\n- The import itself is syntactically correct and does not inherently pose a security risk.\n- The main concern is the obfuscated symbol name, which could be used to hide malicious code or functionality elsewhere in the package.\n- No other code is present to evaluate actual malicious behavior or data flow.\n\n### Evaluation of Reports:\nAll reports correctly identify the suspicious, obfuscated symbol name and suggest caution. They note that:\n\n- The obfuscated name could indicate malicious intent or code obfuscation.\n- No direct malicious activity is evident from this single import statement.\n- The lack of further context limits definitive conclusions.\n\n### Scores Review:\n- **Confidence:** Ranges from 0.3 to 0.8, generally high due to suspicion of obfuscation.\n- **Obfuscated:** High (around 0.7 to 0.8), consistent with the symbol name.\n- **Malware:** Mostly low (0.0 to 0.2), as no malicious activity is demonstrated.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly higher (0.2 to 0.3), reflecting suspicion but not confirmed malicious activity.\n\n**Are these scores reasonable?**  \nYes, given the evidence, they seem appropriate. The high obfuscation score reflects suspicion, but the malware score remains low due to lack of evidence.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The key concern is the obfuscated symbol name. It warrants further investigation into the `skranger` package, especially the `_version` module.\n- No immediate malicious activity can be confirmed from this snippet alone.\n- The risk scores could be slightly increased if further context reveals malicious behavior, but based solely on this, current scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0.2 seems appropriate, considering obfuscation but no confirmed malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.7-0.8 is justified.\n- **Risk score:** 0.3 is acceptable, reflecting potential concern but not confirmed threat.\n\n---\n\n### Additional comments:\n- The suspicious naming pattern should prompt a review of the `skranger` package, especially the `_version` module.\n- If this package is from an untrusted source or the symbol is used elsewhere in the code for covert actions, the risk could escalate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code itself is minimal and benign in isolation.\n- The obfuscated symbol name is the primary concern.\n- Scores are reasonable; minor adjustments could be made if further context reveals malicious activity.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0.2\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.8\n- **Risk:** 0.4 (slightly higher due to suspicion, but still not confirmed malicious)\n\nFurther investigation into the package and its components is recommended.",
