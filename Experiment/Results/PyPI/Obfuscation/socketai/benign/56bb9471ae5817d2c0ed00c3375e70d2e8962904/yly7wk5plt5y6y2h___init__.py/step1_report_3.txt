  "purpose": "Import a specific object or symbol from the 'skranger._version' module, likely for version or internal checks.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'skranger._version' module",
  "sinks": "None observed; no data output, network communication, or sensitive data handling present",
  "flows": "Import of symbol from internal module without further processing; no data flow or untrusted data flow observed",
  "anomalies": "Importing from a name that suggests it may be an internal or private component (underscore prefix), which might indicate non-standard or hidden code, but not necessarily malicious",
  "analysis": "The code imports a symbol 'TbHIRNViDmUPISDnORTTEZYEopIYDSTv' from a module within the 'skranger' package. There is no further code execution, data manipulation, or network activity. The symbol's name appears obfuscated or autogenerated, which could suggest an internal or dynamically generated value. No signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration, are evident from this single import statement. The code is minimal and does not perform any operations or logic that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet is a straightforward import statement from an internal module, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The obfuscated-looking symbol name does not inherently imply malicious behavior. Overall, the code appears benign.",
