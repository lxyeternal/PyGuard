  "purpose": "Import a specific attribute from the skranger._version module, likely for version control or metadata.",
  "sources": "Import statement from skranger._version",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data or external effects are present.",
  "flows": "Import source retrieves attribute from skranger._version; no data flows to external systems or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "The attribute name 'TbHIRNViDmUPISDnORTTEZYEopIYDSTv' appears as a random string, which may suggest obfuscation or a generated name rather than a meaningful identifier.",
  "analysis": "The code only performs a single import operation from a module. The attribute name used appears to be a nonsensical or obfuscated string, which is unusual for typical version attributes. No other logic, data processing, or external interactions are present. The suspicious attribute name could be an attempt to hide malicious intent or obfuscate malicious code, but in this context, it is simply an import statement with an oddly named attribute.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal and does not demonstrate malicious behavior on its own. The unusual attribute name warrants a review of the skranger._version module to determine if it contains malicious or obfuscated code. Overall, no malicious activity is evident solely from this snippet.",
