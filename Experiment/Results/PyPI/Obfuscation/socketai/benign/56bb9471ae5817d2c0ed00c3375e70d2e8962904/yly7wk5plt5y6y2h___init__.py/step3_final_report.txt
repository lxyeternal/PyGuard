{
  "purpose": "To import a symbol with an obfuscated name from the internal module 'skranger._version', likely for versioning or internal use.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'skranger._version' module, specifically the symbol 'TbHIRNViDmUPISDnORTTEZYEopIYDSTv'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows are present; the code only performs an import with no further processing or external interactions.",
  "flows": "N/A — single import statement with no data flow or execution beyond import.",
  "anomalies": "The symbol name 'TbHIRNViDmUPISDnORTTEZYEopIYDSTv' appears highly obfuscated or randomly generated, which is unusual for typical identifiers and may indicate obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, syntactically correct import statement. The suspicious aspect is the obfuscated symbol name, which could be used to hide malicious code or functionality. The import itself does not execute any code or perform external actions. Scores assigned in reports reflect high suspicion due to obfuscation (around 0.7-0.8), but low malware likelihood (around 0.1-0.2). The lack of additional context prevents definitive conclusions, but the obfuscation warrants further review of the 'skranger' package, especially the '_version' module. The overall risk is moderate, primarily due to obfuscation, but no active malicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is benign in isolation but uses an obfuscated symbol name, which raises suspicion. No evidence of malicious behavior is present, but further investigation into the 'skranger' package is recommended to confirm the purpose of this symbol and ensure it is not malicious or intentionally obfuscated to hide malicious code.",
