  "purpose": "Import a specific identifier or object from the skranger._version module.",
  "sources": "Import statement that reads data from the skranger._version module.",
  "sinks": "None; this code does not directly send data or write to external systems.",
  "flows": "Imported object or value is stored in the identifier 'TbHIRNViDmUPISDnORTTEZYEopIYDSTv'.",
  "anomalies": "The imported name 'TbHIRNViDmUPISDnORTTEZYEopIYDSTv' appears to be a randomly generated or obfuscated string, which is unusual for a standard import. The module '_version' might suggest versioning information, but the obscured identifier raises suspicion of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a seemingly random or obfuscated identifier from a submodule named '_version' within the 'skranger' package. This pattern could be benign if the package is known and the identifier is a legitimate version or build info. However, the identifier's obfuscated appearance suggests possible code obfuscation or an attempt to hide malicious behavior. No further code is provided, so behavior beyond the import cannot be analyzed. The presence of such a random identifier is suspicious and warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "This single import statement uses an obfuscated identifier, which is unusual and could indicate obfuscation or malicious intent. Without additional context or code, the risk remains uncertain, but the suspicious naming warrants further investigation.",
