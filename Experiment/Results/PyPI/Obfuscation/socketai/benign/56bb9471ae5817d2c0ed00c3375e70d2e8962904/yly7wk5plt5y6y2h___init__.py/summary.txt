  "conclusion": "The import statement is benign in isolation but uses an obfuscated symbol name, which raises suspicion. No evidence of malicious behavior is present, but further investigation into the 'skranger' package is recommended to confirm the purpose of this symbol and ensure it is not malicious or intentionally obfuscated to hide malicious code."
