{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package, including dependencies and package data, using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Readings include the import of 'setuptools' and the variables containing package metadata and data.",
  "sinks": "The 'setup' function call at the end executes with the provided arguments, potentially affecting package installation.",
  "flows": "Data flows from variable definitions into the 'setup' function, which then processes and applies the package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names (e.g., 'KOSYnZrPIugSRrRoQbxjnRlMPZiJLeJx') and inconsistent string formatting (e.g., missing long_description content). No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious external connections detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' for package setup. It assigns package metadata and data to variables with obfuscated names, likely to hinder straightforward analysis. The variables include package dependencies, data files, and package info. The function 'dRpUfzEQhuLDIeZIPTVocuiUJekHWuuQ' appears to be a custom or obfuscated wrapper around the 'setup' function, called with the package info. No external network connections, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The obfuscated naming and incomplete 'long_description' might be a red flag for obfuscation, but there's no malicious intent apparent from this code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package setup script with obfuscated variable names and no evident malicious or malicious intent. The obfuscation may suggest an attempt to hide details, but no malicious actions are detected based on this code alone.",
