  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, external modules, network connections, data inputs.",
  "sinks": "Network transmissions, file operations, environment variable access, system calls.",
  "flows": "Input sources (env vars, modules) to processing functions, potential data exfiltration or system impact points.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears straightforward with no signs of malicious intent. No suspicious data flows or anomalous patterns are evident. The absence of code snippets limits certainty, but the provided context suggests benign behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the analysis. Confidence levels are appropriate given the limited information.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available information, the dependency shows no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, and the code is likely benign. The assessments and scores are justified and align with best practices for open-source dependency review.",
