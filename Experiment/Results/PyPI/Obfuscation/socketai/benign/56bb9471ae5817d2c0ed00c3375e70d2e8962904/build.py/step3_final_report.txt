  "purpose": "Build setup script for Cython extensions, discovering .pyx files and configuring compilation.",
  "sources": "Directory traversal functions reading filesystem for .pyx files, module name processing functions.",
  "sinks": "The setup and cythonize functions initiating compilation; no external data or network activity detected.",
  "flows": "Filesystem reading to source file discovery, then to extension configuration and compilation setup.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of variable and function names, but no malicious code, network activity, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard directory traversal to locate .pyx files, configures Cython extensions, and invokes setup routines. Obfuscated variable names suggest concealment but do not indicate malicious intent. No suspicious data flows, network activity, or malicious behaviors are present. The build process appears legitimate, and the obfuscation is superficial, likely for concealment rather than malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate build setup for Cython modules with superficial obfuscation. No evidence of malware or malicious activity is present. The obfuscation raises some suspicion but does not imply malicious intent. Overall, the supply chain risk is minimal.",
