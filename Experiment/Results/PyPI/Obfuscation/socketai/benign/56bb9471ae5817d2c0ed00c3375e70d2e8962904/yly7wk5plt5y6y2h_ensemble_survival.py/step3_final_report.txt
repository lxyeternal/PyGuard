{
  "purpose": "A wrapper class implementing Ranger Random Forest Survival for scikit-learn compatibility, utilizing the Ranger C++ library via Cython.",
  "sources": "Input features and parameters fed into the class attributes during instantiation and method calls.",
  "sinks": "No external communication, network activity, or data exfiltration observed within the code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into class attributes, then into the Ranger C++ library functions during training and prediction.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of parameter and class names, placeholder-like comments, but no malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard wrapper for Ranger survival analysis with obfuscated naming, likely for proprietary or auto-generated purposes. No signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, code injection, or data leaks. The obfuscation is high but appears benign, possibly to conceal implementation details. No evidence of backdoors, malicious data handling, or sabotage was found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, obfuscated implementation of a Ranger-based survival analysis model. There is no evidence of malware or malicious activity. The high obfuscation score reflects naming concealment but does not imply malicious intent. Overall security risk is low.",
