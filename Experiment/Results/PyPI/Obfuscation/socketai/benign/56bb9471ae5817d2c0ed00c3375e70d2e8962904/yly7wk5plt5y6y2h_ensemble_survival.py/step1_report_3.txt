  "purpose": "Implementation of a custom Random Forest Survival model based on the Ranger C++ library, integrated with scikit-learn interface.",
  "sources": "No explicit data sources; code imports external libraries and defines a class with parameters, attributes, and methods.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no network, file, or system command executions present.",
  "flows": "The class uses parameters and attributes to process data, but no explicit data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is observed.",
  "anomalies": "Class name appears obfuscated or randomly generated, and many parameter names are nonsensical or appear as random strings, suggesting potential obfuscation or obfuscated code. No hardcoded secrets or credentials detected. Code contains descriptive docstrings but no executable logic shown.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class inheriting from ranger and sklearn base classes for survival analysis. It primarily consists of parameter definitions, attributes, and docstrings. No functions or executable logic are provided that process data directly. The obfuscated naming conventions and nonsensical parameter names could indicate obfuscation or malicious intent, but no malicious behavior such as network access, file manipulation, or code execution is present. No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious imports, or code injection are evident. The code appears to be a legitimate, though obfuscated, implementation of a machine learning model class with no malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily defines a model class with obfuscated naming, which might raise suspicion; however, there are no signs of malicious behavior, malicious data handling, or system sabotage. It seems to be a standard model wrapper with obfuscated names. Without additional executable logic, the likelihood of malicious intent is low.",
