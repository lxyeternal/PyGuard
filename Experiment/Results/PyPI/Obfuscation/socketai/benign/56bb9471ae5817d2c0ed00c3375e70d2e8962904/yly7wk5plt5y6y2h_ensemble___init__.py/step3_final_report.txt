  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code indicators such as code injection, data leakage, insecure practices, and obfuscation.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, network sockets, environment variables, external modules, and potentially untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic execution functions ('eval', 'exec'), network communication endpoints, file operations, and environment variable access that could lead to data exfiltration or code injection.",
  "flows": "Untrusted data flows from sources like network or environment variables into sinks such as 'eval', 'exec', or network transmission points, potentially leading to malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'eval'/'exec' on untrusted data, hardcoded suspicious URLs/IPs, obfuscated code segments, misleading variable names, and conditional logic with unclear purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code contains dynamic execution functions ('eval', 'exec') operating on data from untrusted sources, with hardcoded network addresses and obfuscated segments indicating malicious intent. The presence of such behaviors suggests active malicious behavior, including potential command and control communication or code injection. Other code appears benign, with no signs of data leakage or security misconfigurations. The obfuscation level and suspicious network activity justify high malware and security risk scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code in the dependency exhibits likely malicious behavior, primarily due to dynamic code execution from untrusted sources, obfuscated logic, and suspicious network addresses. The overall security risk is high, warranting caution or avoidance of this package. The analysis justifies a malware score of 0.7, obfuscation score of 0.7, and security risk score of 0.75, with confidence in these assessments.",
