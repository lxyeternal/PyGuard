  "obfuscated": 0.7,
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "conclusion": "The code in the dependency exhibits likely malicious behavior, primarily due to dynamic code execution from untrusted sources, obfuscated logic, and suspicious network addresses. The overall security risk is high, warranting caution or avoidance of this package. The analysis justifies a malware score of 0.7, obfuscation score of 0.7, and security risk score of 0.75, with confidence in these assessments."
