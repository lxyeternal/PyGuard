      "conclusion": "The import statement is benign in isolation but uses an obfuscated symbol name, which raises suspicion. No evidence of malicious behavior is present, but further investigation into the 'skranger' package is recommended to confirm the purpose of this symbol and ensure it is not malicious or intentionally obfuscated to hide malicious code."

The high obfuscation scores are justified, and malware likelihood remains low to moderate. The overall security risk is moderate, emphasizing the need for further dynamic and static analysis before deployment."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits obfuscated techniques involving dynamic modification of class attribute accessors, which are often associated with covert or malicious behavior. While no direct malicious actions are evident, the pattern's suspicious nature warrants further review, especially in untrusted environments. The scores should reflect moderate suspicion with high obfuscation and a cautious security risk level."

      "conclusion": "The code in the dependency exhibits likely malicious behavior, primarily due to dynamic code execution from untrusted sources, obfuscated logic, and suspicious network addresses. The overall security risk is high, warranting caution or avoidance of this package. The analysis justifies a malware score of 0.7, obfuscation score of 0.7, and security risk score of 0.75, with confidence in these assessments."
