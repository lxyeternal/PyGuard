  "purpose": "Assigns a string value '0.8.0' to a variable, possibly representing a version number.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or transmit data to any external system.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink exists; the code only assigns a string to a variable.",
  "anomalies": "The variable name 'TbHIRNViDmUPISDnORTTEZYEopIYDSTv' appears randomly generated or obfuscated; no other suspicious activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static string '0.8.0' to an unusually named variable. There are no imports, functions, or additional logic. The variable name looks obfuscated, which could suggest hiding intent, but with no further context or actions, it appears benign. No input handling, data processing, or external communication is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple assignment with an obfuscated variable name. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks based on this snippet alone.",
