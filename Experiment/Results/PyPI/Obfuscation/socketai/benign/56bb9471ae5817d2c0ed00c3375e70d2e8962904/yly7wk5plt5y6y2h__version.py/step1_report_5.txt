  "purpose": "Assignment of a version string to a variable, likely related to package versioning.",
  "sources": "Assignment statement: TbHIRNViDmUPISDnORTTEZYEopIYDSTv = \"0.8.0\"",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data processing or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; simple variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Variable name appears obfuscated or randomly generated, but this alone does not indicate malicious intent. No other anomalies observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single line assigning a string \"0.8.0\" to a variable with an obfuscated name. No input handling, data processing, or external interactions are present. The obfuscated variable name could suggest an attempt to hide purpose, but without further context, it is not inherently malicious. No suspicious patterns, such as code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration, are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple version string assignment with an obfuscated variable name. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet. The code is benign.",
