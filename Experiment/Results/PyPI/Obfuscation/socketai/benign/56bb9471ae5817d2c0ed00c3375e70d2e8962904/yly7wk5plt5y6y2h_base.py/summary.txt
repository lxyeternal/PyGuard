  "security_risk": 0.5,

  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated, which raises suspicion but does not provide concrete evidence of malicious activity. The high obfuscation scores are justified, and malware likelihood remains low to moderate. The overall security risk is moderate, emphasizing the need for further dynamic and static analysis before deployment."
