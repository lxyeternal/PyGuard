  "conclusion": "The code dependencies analyzed show no definitive malicious activity. Obfuscation and dynamic execution features are present in some cases but do not currently indicate malicious intent. The overall security posture is low risk, though continued monitoring is recommended for obfuscated or dynamically loaded code segments."
