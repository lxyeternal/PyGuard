  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Flask application setup with obfuscated import names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation that would indicate security risks. The obfuscation alone does not imply malicious intent, but warrants a low to moderate malware score due to lack of transparency. Overall, the security risk is minimal."
