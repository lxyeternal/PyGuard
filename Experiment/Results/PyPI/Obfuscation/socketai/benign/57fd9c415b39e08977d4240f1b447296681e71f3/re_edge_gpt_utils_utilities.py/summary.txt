  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions with obfuscation that could be used to conceal intent but shows no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The low malware and risk scores assigned in the reports are appropriate. External constants and modules should be reviewed for malicious content, but based solely on this code snippet, the overall security risk remains low."
