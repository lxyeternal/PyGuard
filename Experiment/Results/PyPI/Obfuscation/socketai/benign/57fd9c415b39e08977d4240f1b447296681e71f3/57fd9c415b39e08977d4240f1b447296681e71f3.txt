      "conclusion": "The code is benign, involving only static imports with obfuscated or misspelled identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security vulnerabilities in this snippet. The obfuscated names warrant caution but are not definitive proof of malicious intent. The low security risk score is justified. Further review of the actual modules is recommended if obfuscation appears suspicious in context."

      "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate CLI chat client with significant obfuscation and dynamic module usage. While these features raise suspicion, there is no concrete evidence of malware or malicious activity. The main risks stem from obfuscation, external dependencies, and potential exploitation of dynamic loading. Further investigation into the external module and the contents of the cookie files is recommended before trusting or deploying this code."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is a typical Flask application setup with obfuscated import names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation that would indicate security risks. The obfuscation alone does not imply malicious intent, but warrants a low to moderate malware score due to lack of transparency. Overall, the security risk is minimal."

      "conclusion": "The code dependencies analyzed show no definitive malicious activity. Obfuscation and dynamic execution features are present in some cases but do not currently indicate malicious intent. The overall security posture is low risk, though continued monitoring is recommended for obfuscated or dynamically loaded code segments."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate API interface for AI/chat functionalities, with obfuscated naming possibly for proprietary reasons. There is no evidence of malware or malicious sabotage. Security concerns are limited to credential handling and external dependencies, which should be reviewed but do not currently indicate malicious intent."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be primarily for API documentation and blueprint registration, with no explicit malicious payloads. However, the direct use of unvalidated YAML input and dynamic external modules pose potential security risks if inputs or modules are malicious. The obfuscated names contribute to suspicion but are not definitive evidence of malicious intent. Overall, the code is low risk but warrants cautious review of external inputs and dependencies."

      "confidence": 0.85,
      "conclusion": "Most code is benign, but reports 2, 3, and 5 show significant obfuscation and dynamic behavior indicative of potential malicious activity. Adjusting malware scores for reports 2 and 5 to higher values (around 0.6 and 0.75 respectively) better reflects their suspicious nature, while keeping scores for benign code low. Overall, the scoring is consistent with the evidence, with minor adjustments recommended for accuracy."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions with obfuscation that could be used to conceal intent but shows no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The low malware and risk scores assigned in the reports are appropriate. External constants and modules should be reviewed for malicious content, but based solely on this code snippet, the overall security risk remains low."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of obfuscated custom exception classes. There is no evidence of malicious activity, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities. The high obfuscation score is justified but does not elevate the security risk. The current scores are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary."
