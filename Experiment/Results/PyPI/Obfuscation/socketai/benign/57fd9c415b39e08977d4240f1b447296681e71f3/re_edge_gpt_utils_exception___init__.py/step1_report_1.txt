  "sources": "Input data may be read from environment variables, function parameters, or file I/O operations if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, file writes, or system commands, but none are explicitly identified in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flow would typically be from input sources to output sinks, but no such flow is explicitly observable here.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious function names, or obfuscated code are present. The code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is minimal or missing, with no indicators of malicious activity, obfuscated logic, or malicious payloads. There are no signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious network activity. The code appears to be benign, focusing on normal functionality without any suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems safe, with no anomalies or malicious indicators detected.",
