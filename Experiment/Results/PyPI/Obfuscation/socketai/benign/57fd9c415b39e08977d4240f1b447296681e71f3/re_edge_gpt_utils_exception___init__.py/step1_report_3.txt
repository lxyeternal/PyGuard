  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be a simple Python script that performs some data processing or utility function.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'input.txt' file and possibly from environment variables (if used).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include writing to 'output.txt', printing to the console, or sending data over the network if present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file reading (or environment variables) through processing functions, then potentially to output or network transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are detected. No suspicious dynamic code execution or unusual language features are observed. The code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard data processing script. It reads input from a file, processes it with simple functions, and outputs the results. There are no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, network communication with suspicious domains, or system damage. No insecure practices like SQL injection, insecure environment variable use, or code injection are detected. The structure is clear and standard, with no obfuscation or malicious code constructs.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a benign utility script with no suspicious signals.",
