  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of obfuscated custom exception classes. There is no evidence of malicious activity, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities. The high obfuscation score is justified but does not elevate the security risk. The current scores are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary."
