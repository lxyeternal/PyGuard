{
  "purpose": "Define multiple custom exception classes, possibly for use in larger application or library.",
  "sources": "Class definitions that inherit from Exception, no input or data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external system interactions observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data propagation detected.",
  "anomalies": "Class names are obfuscated and randomly generated, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No code execution or data leakage observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions with obfuscated class names. There are no data inputs, external calls, or suspicious constructs present. The obfuscation of class names could be indicative of malicious intent or just poor naming, but in isolation, it is not proof of malicious behavior. There is no evidence of code injection, data leakage, or harmful activities. The absence of any runtime behavior or external interaction means there is no malicious activity apparent.",
  "conclusion": "This code only defines several obfuscated custom exception classes with no malicious or harmful behavior. While the obfuscated class names are unusual, the code itself is benign and does not contain malware or security risks.",
