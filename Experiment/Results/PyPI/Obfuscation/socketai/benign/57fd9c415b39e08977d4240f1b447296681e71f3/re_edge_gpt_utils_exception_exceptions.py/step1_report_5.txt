{
  "purpose": "Define multiple custom exception classes with obfuscated names, likely for use in a larger codebase.",
  "sources": "Class definitions that inherit from Exception, with no other data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, input/output, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only declares classes.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual naming of classes with random strings, no comments or documentation, and all classes are simple exception subclasses with no additional logic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from Exception with obfuscated names. No logic, data handling, or external interactions are present. The naming might suggest an attempt at obfuscation, but without additional code, these are merely custom exceptions. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors are evident. The classes could be used for control flow or error handling in a larger program, but on their own, they are benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be simple class definitions for custom exceptions with obfuscated names. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risks based solely on these class definitions.",
