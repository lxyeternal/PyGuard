{
  "purpose": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes, likely for use in larger Python programs or modules.",
  "sources": "Class definitions at the beginning of the code that inherit from Exception.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; the code does not process untrusted input or perform any actions based on data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code solely defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code observed. The class names are obfuscated, but that alone is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, all inheriting from Exception. The class names appear intentionally obfuscated, but no operations, data handling, or external interactions are present. There are no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, network communication, or code injection. The structure is straightforward and typical for defining custom exceptions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of obfuscated exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security risks. The obfuscation of class names is likely for obscurity but does not indicate malicious behavior.",
