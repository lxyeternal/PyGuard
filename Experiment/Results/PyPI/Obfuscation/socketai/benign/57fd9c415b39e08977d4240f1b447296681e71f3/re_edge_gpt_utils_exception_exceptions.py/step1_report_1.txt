{
  "purpose": "Define multiple custom exception classes with obfuscated names.",
  "sources": "Class definitions that inherit from Exception, no input or data reading present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling operations observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; simply defining classes.",
  "anomalies": "Class names are intentionally obfuscated, which may be suspicious; no meaningful implementation or comments; no external data or credentials; no suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of multiple class definitions inheriting from Exception, with non-descriptive, obfuscated class names. There are no input reads, data leaks, or code execution mechanisms. Obfuscation of class names could be an attempt to hide malicious intent, but without additional code or context, these are just class definitions. The code does not perform any operations or malicious activities on its own.",
  "conclusion": "This appears to be a set of obfuscated custom exception classes with no direct malicious behavior. The obfuscation raises suspicion, but with no other context or operations, this code alone does not exhibit malware or security risks.",
