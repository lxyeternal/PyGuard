  "obfuscated": 0.75,
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "conclusion": "Most code is benign, but reports 2, 3, and 5 show significant obfuscation and dynamic behavior indicative of potential malicious activity. Adjusting malware scores for reports 2 and 5 to higher values (around 0.6 and 0.75 respectively) better reflects their suspicious nature, while keeping scores for benign code low. Overall, the scoring is consistent with the evidence, with minor adjustments recommended for accuracy."
