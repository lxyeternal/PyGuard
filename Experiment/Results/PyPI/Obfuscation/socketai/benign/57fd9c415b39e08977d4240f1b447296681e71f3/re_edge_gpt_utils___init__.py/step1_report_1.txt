{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple Python script that performs a calculation and prints the result. There is no indication of malicious intent based on the visible functionality.",
  "sources": "Input is not explicitly read from external sources; the code uses a hardcoded number for calculation.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs to the console via print statement; no data leaks or external connections are present.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows from external sources to sinks; the calculation uses static data only.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward with no obfuscated elements, no hardcoded credentials, or unusual code patterns. No suspicious imports or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a simple arithmetic operation using hardcoded values and outputs the result. It does not read external input, connect to external servers, or modify files. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code structure is minimal and clear. No anomalies or obfuscation are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a basic calculation and output. No malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies detected.",
