  "purpose": "Static import statements from modules with obfuscated or misspelled identifiers, defining an export list.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 're_edge_gpt' modules, referencing functions/classes with obfuscated or nonsensical names.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external communication; code only performs static imports and exports.",
  "flows": "Import statements as sources; no data flow or execution beyond module loading.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated-looking identifiers, typographical errors in module names ('image_genearation'), and only static import statements with no further logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of import statements with obfuscated or misspelled names and an __all__ list. No dynamic behavior, data processing, or external communication is present. The obfuscated identifiers could be placeholders or intentional obfuscation but do not, in themselves, indicate malicious intent. The typographical errors are likely accidental. The malware score is appropriately low (0), as there is no evidence of malicious activity. The obfuscation score is moderate (~0.6), reflecting suspicion due to nonsensical identifiers, but not proof of malicious behavior. The security risk score is minimal (~0.1), given the static nature of the code and absence of external effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, involving only static imports with obfuscated or misspelled identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security vulnerabilities in this snippet. The obfuscated names warrant caution but are not definitive proof of malicious intent. The low security risk score is justified. Further review of the actual modules is recommended if obfuscation appears suspicious in context.",
