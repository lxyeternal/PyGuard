  "flows": "openapi_yaml_content -> openapi_file.write, APISpec.to_yaml() -> writes YAML content to file",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code behavior detected; standard API spec generation and file writing operations",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for creating and exporting an OpenAPI spec for a Flask app, importing standard API specification libraries and Flask components. It writes the provided YAML content into a file and registers API blueprints with the spec. There are no hardcoded credentials, network communications, or suspicious data flows. No obfuscated code or malicious activities are present. The URL in the spec is local and non-malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard implementation for generating API documentation with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
