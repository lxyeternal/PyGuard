  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate CLI chat client with significant obfuscation and dynamic module usage. While these features raise suspicion, there is no concrete evidence of malware or malicious activity. The main risks stem from obfuscation, external dependencies, and potential exploitation of dynamic loading. Further investigation into the external module and the contents of the cookie files is recommended before trusting or deploying this code."
