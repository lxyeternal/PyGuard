Other reports are consistent with safe code. Final assessment: malware=0.6, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.75."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of descriptive comments with no executable or malicious content. The suspicious string is likely a placeholder or obfuscation artifact within comments. No evidence of malicious behavior or security risks is present. The high obfuscation score reflects suspicion but does not indicate active malicious intent. Overall, the snippet appears safe, but a review of the full implementation is advisable to rule out concealed malicious logic."

      "conclusion": "The code is a highly obfuscated, standard tokenizer/lexer with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The obfuscation likely serves to protect intellectual property or hinder reverse engineering rather than conceal malicious intent. The supply chain risk from this code is minimal, with a malware score of 0 and a low security risk score. The obfuscation is significant but not indicative of malicious activity based on the provided fragment."
