{
  "purpose": "This code appears to parse, process, and structure a GraphQL schema, including handling various GraphQL types and constructing a schema definition object.",
  "sources": "Reads input from string or GraphQL schema objects; accesses attributes and methods of these objects; reads type definitions and values; uses 'graphql.parse' and 'graphql.build_ast_schema'.",
  "sinks": "Calls to 'graphql.parse' and 'graphql.build_ast_schema' could process untrusted schema strings; attribute access and method calls are generally safe, but if input is malicious, parsing/building could be exploited.",
  "flows": "Input schema string -> parsed by 'graphql.parse' -> built into schema object -> schema attributes accessed -> type and field processing, including type unwrapping and schema construction.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated function names and variable names; dynamic attribute access with 'hasattr' and 'get_type_map'; complex, nested loops and type checks; no clear validation or sanitization of inputs.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically processes GraphQL schemas, handling different types, and constructs schema components. It uses obfuscated naming, which complicates understanding. No explicit malicious behavior such as network access, data exfiltration, or system modification is evident. The use of 'graphql.parse' and 'build_ast_schema' with potentially untrusted input could be risky if inputs are maliciously crafted. The dynamic attribute access and complex logic may be intended to obfuscate or manipulate schema structures but do not inherently indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are visible. Overall, the code's obfuscation and input handling complexity raise suspicion, but there are no direct malicious actions observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily schema processing for GraphQL, with obfuscated naming and complex logic. It does not demonstrate malicious intent, but the obfuscation and handling of schema inputs could be exploited if inputs are maliciously crafted. Overall, low likelihood of malicious behavior, but caution is advised if schema inputs are untrusted.",
