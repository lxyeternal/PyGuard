  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code execution points, data input sources, environment variables, network connections, file operations.",
  "sinks": "Potential data exfiltration points, network communication, system modifications, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or user input to sinks like network sockets or file writes, possibly via dynamic eval/exec.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), hardcoded strings, suspicious data flows, incomplete code snippets.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits high obfuscation and dynamic execution patterns indicative of malicious intent, leading to a malware score of 0.6 and obfuscation score of 0.9. Other reports show no suspicious activity, with scores aligned to their descriptions. The primary concern is the obfuscated code with potential for malicious behavior, while the rest are benign or incomplete. Risk scores are adjusted accordingly, with higher suspicion in Report 1 and minimal risk elsewhere.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency's code in Report 1 warrants caution due to obfuscation and dynamic execution, suggesting moderate malicious potential. Other reports are consistent with benign or incomplete code. Overall, supply chain risk is moderate, primarily driven by obfuscation and potential hidden malicious intent.",
