  "security_risk": 0.7,

  "conclusion": "The dependency's code in Report 1 warrants caution due to obfuscation and dynamic execution, suggesting moderate malicious potential. Other reports are consistent with benign or incomplete code. Overall, supply chain risk is moderate, primarily driven by obfuscation and potential hidden malicious intent."
