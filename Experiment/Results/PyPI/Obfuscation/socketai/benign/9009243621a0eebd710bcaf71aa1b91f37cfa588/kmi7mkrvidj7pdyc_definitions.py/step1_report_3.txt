  "purpose": "Define GraphQL schema-related classes and data structures for GraphQL object types, interfaces, unions, scalars, input objects, and enums.",
  "sources": "Imports from dataclasses, typing, and graphql libraries. Initialization of class attributes and default factory calls.",
  "sinks": "Use of getattr() method to access attributes of _graphql_field, which could potentially be untrusted if the object is malicious.",
  "flows": "Initialization of class instances with g_field, then attribute access via PzwxbRCbGFXygFuaobVeajhaCTwPwaqO method.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual import of a non-standard class name VTJRiCderAUpOoFsyNpbpwRaqmxVzuAE; the class and variable names are obfuscated, which may indicate malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data classes and a standard wrapper class for GraphQL schema types. The use of dynamic attribute access via getattr() could be exploited if _graphql_field is malicious or contains malicious attributes. The obfuscated class and variable names suggest an attempt to hide the true intent of the code. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic such as network connections or data leaks are present. The code appears to be a straightforward schema definition wrapper with obfuscation, which could be used maliciously if imported into a broader malicious context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily schema definition with obfuscated identifiers. While not overtly malicious on its own, the obfuscation and dynamic attribute access could be exploited in a malicious supply chain attack if combined with malicious inputs or data. No direct malicious activity detected, but caution is advised due to obfuscation and potential for misuse.",
