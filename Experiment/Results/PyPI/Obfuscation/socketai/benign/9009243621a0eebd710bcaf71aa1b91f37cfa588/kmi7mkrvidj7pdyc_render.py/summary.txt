  "conclusion": "The code is a template rendering utility with obfuscation and dynamic environment configuration. There is no direct evidence of malicious activity such as malware, data exfiltration, or system compromise. The primary security concern is input validation for file paths to prevent directory traversal or injection attacks. The overall malware score is low, the obfuscation score is high, and the security risk is moderate, primarily due to dynamic path handling and lack of input sanitization."
