  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with minimal security risks, primarily related to subprocess execution if inputs are untrusted. Scores are consistent with the analysis, with malware set to 0, obfuscation absent, and a low security risk score (~0.2). Vigilance regarding subprocess input validation is advised to maintain security integrity."
