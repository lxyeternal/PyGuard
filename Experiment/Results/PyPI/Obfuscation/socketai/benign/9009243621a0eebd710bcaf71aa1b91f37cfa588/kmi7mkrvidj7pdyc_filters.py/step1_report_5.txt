{
  "purpose": "The code appears to provide utility functions for processing GraphQL types, converting data to a specific markdown format, and sanitizing input strings.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function arguments and from the imported utilities (hQKhtIXqyafPKIkadrLPZbSAimyvRGXY).",
  "sinks": "The code does not directly write data to external systems, network, or files, but the conversion and sanitization functions could be used to process untrusted data for display or further use.",
  "flows": "Input data from function arguments is passed through normalization and sanitization functions; GraphQL objects are inspected and transformed for display or further processing.",
  "anomalies": "The variable names are obfuscated or nonsensical, which could be a sign of attempt to hide malicious intent or obfuscate malicious code. The code imports an external utility and uses it without context. There are no obvious malicious actions such as network calls, file access, or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides utility functions: one for classifying GraphQL types, one for converting a GraphQL object into markdown, and one for sanitizing input strings by normalizing, removing non-ASCII characters, stripping special characters, and formatting. The obfuscated variable names and lack of clear data sinks suggest an attempt to conceal purpose, but the functions themselves are benign. No suspicious code injection, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The imported utility could be benign or malicious, but without its content, this cannot be confirmed. The code does not perform any network communication, system modification, or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of utility functions for processing GraphQL types and sanitizing input strings, with obfuscated variable names that raise suspicion. However, there are no direct signs of malicious behavior or malware. The main concern is the obfuscation, which warrants caution, but based solely on this code, it does not exhibit malicious intent.",
