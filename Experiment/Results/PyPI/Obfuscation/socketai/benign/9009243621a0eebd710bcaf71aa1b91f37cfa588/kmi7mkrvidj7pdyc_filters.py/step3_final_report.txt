  "purpose": "Utility functions for GraphQL type classification, markdown rendering, and string normalization.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'gdCaVeuanEQXvqyurymfzFZlmpRMocdy', external utility 'hQKhtIXqyafPKIkadrLPZbSAimyvRGXY', and imported modules.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no data leaks, network calls, or external outputs.",
  "flows": "Input data is processed through type checks, markdown conversion, and normalization functions without external data flows or side effects.",
  "anomalies": "Use of heavily obfuscated variable and function names; reliance on external utility 'hQKhtIXqyafPKIkadrLPZbSAimyvRGXY' with unknown implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data processing: classifying GraphQL types, converting markdown, and normalizing strings. Obfuscation is present but does not imply malicious intent. No network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection is detected. External utility usage warrants caution but is not inherently malicious. The functions are straightforward and serve benign purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of benign utility functions with obfuscated naming. No evidence of malware or malicious activity is present. The primary concern is obfuscation, which should be reviewed in context, but based solely on this code, it is safe.",
