  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, extensive testing suite for RocksDB features with no evidence of malicious activity, sabotage, or supply chain compromise. The obfuscation is typical for complex test code and does not suggest malicious intent. The security risk is very low, and the malware score should remain at 0."
