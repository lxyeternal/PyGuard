  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script with no explicit purpose provided.",
  "sources": "Input is not clearly read; no explicit input sources such as user input, environment variables, or external data are evident.",
  "sinks": "No suspicious sinks such as network connections, file writes, or eval/exec functions are present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are identified; the code executes without handling untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated sections are observed. The code structure is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code provided is either empty or missing in the prompt, making a thorough review impossible. Based on the absence of code content, there are no indications of malicious activity, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors. Since no operations, data handling, or third-party interactions are shown, there is no evidence of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "Given the lack of code content, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign or simply absent.",
