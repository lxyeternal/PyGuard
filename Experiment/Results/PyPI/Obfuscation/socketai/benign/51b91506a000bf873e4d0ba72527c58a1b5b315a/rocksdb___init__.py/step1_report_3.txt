{
  "purpose": "The code imports all functions, classes, and variables from the internal module '_rocksdb'.",
  "sources": "Import statement that loads the '_rocksdb' module.",
  "sinks": "Importing the internal module '_rocksdb' which may contain sensitive or low-level database functionalities.",
  "flows": "Importing the module '_rocksdb' could lead to execution of its code at import time, but no direct data flow or untrusted input handling is shown here.",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative import with a likely private or internal module '_rocksdb'. This could be suspicious if the module contains hidden malicious code, but the import statement itself is standard. No hardcoded credentials or unusual code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains a single import statement from a relative module '_rocksdb'. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscation. Since '_rocksdb' appears to be an internal or private module, this is typical for internal package structure, but it warrants review of the '_rocksdb' module itself for any hidden malicious code. No external input handling or suspicious operations are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement of an internal module, with no malicious intent or security risks evident from this snippet alone. It is common in Python projects that interface with low-level database functionalities. Further review of the '_rocksdb' module is recommended to ensure it does not contain malicious code.",
