{
  "purpose": "Import all public symbols from the internal '_rocksdb' module, likely to use its database functionalities.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; it loads the '_rocksdb' module which is presumably part of the package.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present in this code snippet; however, if the imported module interacts with untrusted data or external systems, those could be sinks.",
  "flows": "The code imports the '_rocksdb' module; any subsequent code using this module might flow untrusted data into database operations, but this is not visible here.",
  "anomalies": "The use of a relative import from a potentially internal module ('._rocksdb') is somewhat unusual but not inherently malicious; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior is present.",
  "analysis": "This snippet only performs an import from an internal module, which suggests the package depends on a local or internal implementation of RocksDB. No malicious code, data handling, or suspicious behaviors are observable in this minimal code. Without additional context or usage, there is no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement from an internal module, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It is likely part of a larger database handling package. No malicious behavior is evident in this snippet.",
