  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code snippet and the associated reasoning.\n\n**Code Under Review:**\n```python\nfrom ._rocksdb import *\n```\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- The code performs a wildcard import from a relative internal module `_rocksdb`.\n- No direct malicious activity or data flow is evident from this line alone.\n- Use of wildcard import reduces code clarity and can obscure what is imported, but it is not inherently malicious.\n- The module name `_rocksdb` suggests an internal interface to RocksDB, a common embedded database engine.\n\n---\n\n### Specific Review of Each Report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** Import all from `_rocksdb`, potential data manipulation if used improperly.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes that the import alone is not malicious but warns about the obscurity caused by `*`.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both set to 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing internal module `_rocksdb`.\n- **Analysis:** Appropriately states that the import is standard and not suspicious.\n- **Scores:** Both 0, fitting the context.\n- **Verdict:** Correct. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Highlights internal nature, possible low-level database functions.\n- **Analysis:** Recognizes the import as standard and recommends reviewing `_rocksdb` itself.\n- **Scores:** Malware at 0, security risk at 0.2; reasonable.\n- **Justification for scores:** The import alone isn't malicious, but internal modules can contain vulnerabilities; thus, a low security risk score is justified.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, no suspicious activity.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly states that this is a standard import.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0.2, consistent.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Emphasizes the lack of malicious activity and internal nature.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly states that the import is benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0.1; reasonable.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Presence of issues in code:** No, the code is a straightforward import statement.\n- **Errors or flaws in reports:** The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n- **Scores:** All reports appropriately assign zero to malware, with low security risk scores reflecting the internal nature of the module.\n- **Malware justification:** Since no malicious code or behavior is indicated, malware scores should remain at 0.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** Correctly at 0; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** The reports correctly avoid assuming vulnerabilities solely based on the import statement.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- The current scores are reasonable and consistent with the code snippet.\n- The main concern is the use of wildcard import, which can hinder static analysis and code clarity but does not directly pose a security threat.\n- To improve security posture, reviewing the `_rocksdb` module for malicious code or vulnerabilities is advisable, but this is outside the scope of this import statement alone.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my own estimate:**\n\n| Score Type       | My Estimated Score |\n|------------------|--------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                  |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                  |\n| Security Risk    | 0.2 (consistent with reports) |\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe import statement itself is benign. The module `_rocksdb` should be reviewed separately for potential issues, but based solely on this code, there is no indication of malicious or obfuscated behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nAlways review the contents of internal modules like `_rocksdb` to ensure they do not contain malicious code, especially if they are dynamically loaded or contain native extensions.",
