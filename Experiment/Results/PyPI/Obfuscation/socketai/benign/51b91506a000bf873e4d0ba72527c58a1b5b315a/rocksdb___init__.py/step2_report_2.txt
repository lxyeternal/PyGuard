  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the evidence, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe a simple import statement: `from ._rocksdb import *`.\n- The code snippet is straightforward, with no visible malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- The main concern raised is the use of wildcard import, which can obscure what is imported but is not inherently malicious.\n- The module `_rocksdb` appears to be an internal or private module, which is common in projects interfacing with RocksDB.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues in code:** The code matches the description across all reports. No issues or malicious code are present in this import statement alone.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None of the reports provide evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Vulnerabilities:** No vulnerabilities are indicated or implied beyond the general concern about wildcard imports.\n\n---\n\n### Errors, flaws, or reasoning issues:\n- The reports uniformly suggest that the import statement alone does not indicate malicious intent, which is correct.\n- The concern about the use of `*` (wildcard import) is valid from a code clarity and maintainability perspective but not a security concern.\n- The reports do not overstate or understate the risk; their reasoning aligns with standard static analysis principles.\n\n### Score review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the evidence.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Security risk score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting minimal concern, which is reasonable for a simple import.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- No scores above 0.5 are assigned, which is appropriate.\n- The scores are conservative, reflecting the lack of evidence for malicious activity.\n\n### Potential issues:\n- The only potential concern is the use of wildcard import, which could hide imported symbols, but this is a code quality issue, not a security issue.\n- The module `_rocksdb` itself is not examined; if it contains malicious code, that would be outside the scope of this import statement.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **The code itself is benign.**\n- **No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present in the import statement.**\n- **The scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.**\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal risk associated with wildcard import, but not security-related)\n\nThis conservative scoring reflects the current evidence and the context provided.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe import statement is standard, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no changes are necessary. Further review should focus on the contents of `_rocksdb` if any suspicion arises there.",
