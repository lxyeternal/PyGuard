  "purpose": "Import all symbols from the internal '_rocksdb' module for database operations.",
  "sources": "The relative import statement 'from ._rocksdb import *'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present in this import statement.",
  "flows": "The import brings in symbols from '_rocksdb' into the current namespace; no data flow or execution beyond import occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('*') reduces clarity but is not malicious; no obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward relative import of all symbols from an internal module '_rocksdb'. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident from this statement alone. The wildcard import is a style concern but not a security issue. The module name suggests internal use, which is common. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this import and assign low malware and risk scores consistent with the evidence.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is benign and does not indicate malicious activity. The scores assigned are appropriate, with malware score at 0, obfuscated at 0, and a very low security risk (~0.1-0.2). No changes are necessary based solely on this code snippet.",
