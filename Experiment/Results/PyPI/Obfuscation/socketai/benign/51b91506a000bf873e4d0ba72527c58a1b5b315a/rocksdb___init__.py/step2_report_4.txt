  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports concern the same code: `from ._rocksdb import *`.\n- The code is a straightforward relative import of all symbols from a local/internal module `_rocksdb`.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external data leaks is present in the import statement itself.\n- The main concern across reports is the use of wildcard import, which can obscure what functions/classes are imported, potentially leading to maintenance or security issues if used improperly downstream.\n- The `_rocksdb` module's internal or private naming (underscore prefix) suggests it is meant for internal use, which is common and not suspicious by itself.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  No. The import statement itself is benign and standard in Python projects, especially those interfacing with database engines like RocksDB.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report:\n- The reports tend to overstate the potential risks associated with the import statement. They mention \"potential\" data leaks or malicious behavior without any concrete evidence.\n- The use of wildcard import (`*`) is discouraged for clarity but does not inherently introduce security vulnerabilities.\n- The reports do not consider that the `_rocksdb` module might be a well-understood internal component, and the import statement alone does not execute any malicious code.\n\n### Score review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the information.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is reasonable.\n- **Risk score:** Mostly 0.2 or 0.1, reflecting minimal concern. Given the absence of malicious activity, these seem acceptable, but perhaps slightly high if we consider only this line.\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign such scores; all are below 0.5, which is appropriate.\n- If any were to be higher, it would need evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or data exfiltration, none of which are present here.\n\n### Consistency with the report:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis that the import is benign.\n- The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly low.\n- The security risk scores are slightly elevated but still within a conservative range, considering only this snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **The code itself is benign.**\n- **No malicious or obfuscated activity is evident.**\n- **The main concern is the use of wildcard import, which is a style issue rather than a security one.**\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (minimal, mostly style/clarity concern)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe import statement is standard and does not pose a security threat. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the evidence. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nAlways review the actual `_rocksdb` module code to ensure it does not contain hidden malicious code, but based solely on this import statement, there is no security concern.",
