  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet provided, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n```python\nfrom ._rocksdb import *\n```\nThis is a standard relative import of all symbols from an internal module `_rocksdb`. There are no apparent malicious patterns in this import statement alone.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Import all from `_rocksdb` for database operations.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious intent; use of wildcard import reduces clarity but isn't malicious.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (low risk, mainly due to wildcard import).\n\n**Verdict:** The score seems reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Import components from `_rocksdb`.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior evident; internal module.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Import from `_rocksdb`.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity; internal module.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Import `_rocksdb`.\n- **Analysis:** Standard internal import; no suspicious activity.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Import from internal `_rocksdb`.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious signs; typical internal import.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.1 (very low), Obfuscated = 0.\n\n**Verdict:** The low risk score seems appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall observations:\n- All reports correctly identify that this is a simple import statement.\n- No evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or dangerous behavior is present.\n- The scores for malware are consistently zero, which is justified.\n- The risk scores are low, reflecting minimal security concern based solely on this import statement.\n- The obfuscated score is zero across all reports, which is correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all, as no malicious activity is indicated.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, no obfuscation present.\n- **Risk score:** Should remain low, around 0.1 to 0.2, consistent with the reports.\n\n### Additional notes:\n- Wildcard imports (`from module import *`) are discouraged due to reduced clarity but are not inherently malicious.\n- The presence of a module named `_rocksdb` suggests internal or private implementation, which is common in database wrappers.\n- Without examining the actual `_rocksdb` module code, no malicious activity can be inferred.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n- The reports are consistent and reasonable.\n- The scores are appropriate given the limited context.\n- No changes are necessary unless further code or context suggests otherwise.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to reflect minor concerns about wildcard import, but overall very low risk)\n\n**Work through the code step-by-step, confirming that the import statement alone does not indicate malicious intent, and the scores reflect this understanding.**",
