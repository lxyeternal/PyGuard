  "purpose": "Import all components from the internal module '_rocksdb' likely related to database operations.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local/internal module '_rocksdb'. No external data sources or inputs are directly read in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks are evident in this line alone; it is a module import.",
  "flows": "No data flows are observable in this isolated import statement.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a local module named '_rocksdb' could be normal, but the underscore prefix may suggest internal or private use. No malicious code is evident here.",
  "analysis": "This code imports everything from a module named '_rocksdb'. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration within this single import statement. Without additional context or code, it is impossible to determine if the imported module contains malicious code or hidden behaviors. The use of the underscore prefix indicates internal usage, which is common and not suspicious by itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement of a local/internal module, with no immediate signs of malicious intent or security risks. However, without examining the '_rocksdb' module itself, no definitive conclusions about its safety can be made.",
