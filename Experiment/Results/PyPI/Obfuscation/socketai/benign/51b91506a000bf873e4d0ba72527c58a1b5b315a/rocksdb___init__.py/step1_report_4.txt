{
  "purpose": "Import all functions, classes, and variables from the internal module '_rocksdb'.",
  "sources": "The import statement loads code from a relative module '_rocksdb'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sink or untrusted data handling present in this statement.",
  "flows": "None explicitly; the import statement itself does not process data or user input.",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative import suggests internal or package-internal code, but does not inherently indicate malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a relative import statement importing everything from '_rocksdb'. This is a standard practice for modular Python packages. There are no signs of data leaks, hardcoded secrets, or malicious actions. The presence of a module named '_rocksdb' suggests an internal database or storage component, which is common in projects using RocksDB. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or external network activity are present in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no evident malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any actions beyond importing a module. There are no anomalies or malicious behaviors detected.",
