{
  "purpose": "Import all contents from the internal module '_rocksdb' for database operations or data storage.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the current package: 'from ._rocksdb import *'.",
  "sinks": "Potential usage of imported functions or classes could lead to data manipulation or leakage if used improperly, but no direct sink is evident in this line alone.",
  "flows": "No data flow can be determined from this single import statement; it depends on how imported components are used downstream.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('*') can obscure what functions or classes are imported, which is generally discouraged but not inherently malicious. No suspicious code patterns or secrets are visible in this statement.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports all symbols from a module named '_rocksdb' within the same package. This pattern alone does not indicate malicious intent. However, the use of wildcard import may hide the specific functions or classes being imported, making static analysis less transparent. Without additional context or code that shows how these imported components are used, no malicious behavior can be inferred. The module name '_rocksdb' suggests it is a wrapper or interface for RocksDB, a database engine, which is common in many applications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no immediate signs of malicious behavior. The main concern is the use of wildcard import, which can reduce code clarity but does not pose a security threat by itself.",
