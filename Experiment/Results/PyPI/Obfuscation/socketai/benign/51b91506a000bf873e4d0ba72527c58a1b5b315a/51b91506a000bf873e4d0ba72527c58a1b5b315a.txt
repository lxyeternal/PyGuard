While obfuscation warrants caution, the absence of concrete implementation or suspicious activity suggests the code is benign. The overall security risk is low, but continued monitoring of subclasses or implementations is advised."

The only adjustment needed is lowering report 1's risk score from 0.8 to 0.0 due to lack of code. The overall security posture of the dependency appears benign based on the provided information."

The obfuscation is typical for complex test code and does not suggest malicious intent. The security risk is very low, and the malware score should remain at 0."
