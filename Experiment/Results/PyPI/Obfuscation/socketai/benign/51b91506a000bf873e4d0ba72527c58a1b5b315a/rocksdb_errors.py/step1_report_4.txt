  "purpose": "Define multiple custom exception classes with obfuscated names for use in a larger application or library.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and exception inheritance from 'Exception' in Python",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks or external interactions present in the code",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only defines classes without runtime data handling",
  "anomalies": "Class names are intentionally obfuscated and do not provide semantic clarity; no actual functionality or logic beyond class definitions",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, each inheriting from Python's built-in 'Exception'. The class names are obfuscated and do not indicate any behavior or data handling. No data input, no external calls, no suspicious operations, and no malicious code or backdoors are present. The code appears to be a set of placeholders or obfuscated class names potentially used for obfuscation or to hide purpose, but in terms of security risk, this is benign and typical for code obfuscation or obfuscated error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It simply defines multiple custom exception classes with obfuscated names, which could be used for obfuscation or placeholder purposes. There is no evidence of malicious intent or suspicious activity.",
