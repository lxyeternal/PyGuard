  "purpose": "Define multiple custom exception classes with obfuscated names.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; classes are defined statically.",
  "targets": "No data processing or handling; no untrusted data usage.",
  "flows": "No data flows; class definitions are isolated and do not interact.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated class names with no descriptive purpose, no docstrings or comments, which could be an attempt to hide intent.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of defining several custom exception classes with random, nonsensical names. There are no functions, no data handling, no network activity, and no code execution. The obfuscated class names could be a red flag for hiding malicious intent, but as-is, they serve only to obscure purpose. There are no apparent malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code appears to be either intentionally obfuscated or generated without purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet contains only class definitions with obfuscated names, no operational code or data handling. While obfuscation can be a sign of malicious intent, in this context it appears to be merely obfuscated naming. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks based solely on this code.",
