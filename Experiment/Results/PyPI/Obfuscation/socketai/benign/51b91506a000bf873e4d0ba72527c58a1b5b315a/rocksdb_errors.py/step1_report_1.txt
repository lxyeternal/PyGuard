{
  "purpose": "Define multiple custom exception classes with obfuscated names, likely for use in a larger application.",
  "sources": "Class definitions with no external input reading, environment variables, or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leak points are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present since these are just class declarations without logic or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Class names are deliberately obfuscated, which could be an attempt to hide intent or complicate analysis. No other anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or malicious code are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code solely contains the declaration of multiple custom exception classes with obscure, seemingly random names. There are no data sources, input handling, or security-sensitive operations. The obfuscated class names could be a red flag for hiding malicious intent, but in isolation, these are just class declarations. No malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks are detected based on this fragment alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists of obfuscated class definitions serving as custom exceptions, with no active logic or data handling. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues in this isolated fragment.",
