  "purpose": "Define multiple custom exception classes for use in larger Python applications or modules.",
  "sources": "Class definitions that are likely to be used elsewhere in the codebase for error handling.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; classes are simple definitions without logic or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Class names are nonsensical and appear to be randomly generated; no actual logic or data handling present; no secrets, no obfuscation, no dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of several custom exception class definitions inheriting from Exception, with no additional methods, attributes, or logic. Class names appear obfuscated or randomly generated, but this is not inherently malicious. The classes are not used for input processing, data handling, or any operation that could lead to security issues. No signs of malware, suspicious data flows, or security risks are present. The structure is straightforward and typical for defining custom exceptions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely definitional, creating custom exception classes with obfuscated names. There are no malicious behaviors, security risks, or suspicious activities identified. The obfuscation seems intentional but benign in this context.",
