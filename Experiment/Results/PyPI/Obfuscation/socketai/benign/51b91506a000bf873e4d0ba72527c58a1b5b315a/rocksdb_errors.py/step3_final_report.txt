{
  "purpose": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes with obfuscated, nonsensical names, likely used as placeholders or for obfuscation purposes.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from Exception, with obfuscated class names.",
  "sinks": "No data input, output, or external communication present; no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "None; only class declarations without data flow or logic.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class names with no functional code; no logic or data processing; purely class declarations.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only class definitions for custom exceptions with obfuscated names, with no data sources, sinks, or flows. No logic, data handling, or external interactions are present. The obfuscation of class names could be suspicious but is not inherently malicious. Malware and security risk scores are appropriately zero or near-zero, reflecting the benign nature of the code. The high obfuscation score is justified due to the class names. Confidence in the benign assessment is high, given the lack of active code or data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of obfuscated exception class definitions with no malicious intent or active logic. While obfuscation can be a red flag, in this isolated fragment, it appears to be harmless. The scores assigned are consistent with the code content, and no further action is necessary.",
