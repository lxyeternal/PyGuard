  "purpose": "Assess the security implications of the import statement 'from httptest.httptest import *' in the context of supply chain security.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no additional data sources or input points are present in the provided code snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of imported code during import or runtime, which could lead to malicious behavior if the module is compromised.",
  "flows": "Import statement as source; if the module contains malicious code, it could execute during import or later during runtime, affecting the system.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('*'), which obscures imported symbols and can hide malicious code or unintended behaviors; lack of context about the external module's trustworthiness.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a wildcard import from an external module 'httptest.httptest'. While this practice is discouraged for maintainability reasons, it does not inherently indicate malicious intent. The primary security concern is that if the module is malicious or compromised, it could execute harmful code during import or runtime. No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or data leakage is present in the snippet. The scores reflect low malware likelihood (0), no obfuscation (0), and a moderate security risk (0.2) due to the external dependency and import style. The confidence is high (0.9) given the simplicity of the code and lack of suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is benign in isolation, with no direct evidence of malicious activity. The main concern is the use of wildcard import from an external module, which can pose security and maintainability risks if the module is malicious or compromised. Overall, the security risk is low, but caution should be exercised with external dependencies and import practices.",
