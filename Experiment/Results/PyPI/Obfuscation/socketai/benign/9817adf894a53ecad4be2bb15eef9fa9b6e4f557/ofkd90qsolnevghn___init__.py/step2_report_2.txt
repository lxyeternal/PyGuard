  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code is a wildcard import from `httptest.httptest`. The import statement itself is syntactically correct, but wildcard imports are generally discouraged because they obscure what is imported.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No actual malicious behavior is evident from the import alone. The concern is about potential risk if the module is malicious or compromised.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - *Malware:* 0 — no evidence of malicious code.  \n  - *Obfuscated:* 0 — code is straightforward.  \n  - *Risk:* 0.4 — moderate due to the risks associated with importing external code and wildcard import practices.\n- **Justification for risk score:** Since the import could execute or load malicious code if the module is compromised, a risk score of 0.4 seems reasonable.  \n- **Additional notes:** The confidence is 0.6, which is acceptable given the limited context.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue presence:** Similar import statement, with the same concerns about 'import *' and external code.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No malicious activity or data flow is indicated.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - *Malware:* 0 — no evidence of malicious intent.  \n  - *Obfuscated:* 0 — straightforward import.  \n  - *Risk:* 0 — no security risk from this isolated statement.\n- **Justification:** The report correctly identifies that this is benign at this level of analysis.\n- **Confidence:** 0.6, which is reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; a simple import with no further context.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - *Malware:* 0 — no malicious behavior detected.  \n  - *Obfuscated:* 0 — clear code.  \n  - *Risk:* 0 — no security risk based solely on this import.\n- **Justification:** The report's conclusion aligns with the evidence.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9, high confidence given the minimal code.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as previous; import statement only.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No malicious activity or anomalies.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - *Malware:* 0 — no malware indicated.  \n  - *Obfuscated:* 0 — simple import.  \n  - *Risk:* 0 — no security concern from this snippet.\n- **Justification:** Consistent with the analysis.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9, appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same import statement, minimal context.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No suspicious activity or anomalies.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - *Malware:* 0 — no evidence of malicious code.  \n  - *Obfuscated:* 0 — straightforward code.  \n  - *Risk:* 0 — no security risk identified.\n- **Justification:** The conclusion is consistent with the evidence.\n- **Confidence:** 0.5, reflecting the limited context.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk scores:** Most are low (0 or 0.4), which is reasonable given the minimal code and context.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0 across all, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** Given the use of wildcard imports from external modules, I would assign a slightly higher risk score of around 0.3 to 0.4 for each, especially if the source is untrusted. Since the reports already reflect this, I agree with their assessments.\n\n### Final notes:\n- The reports are consistent and reasonable.\n- The primary concern is the use of `import *` from potentially untrusted sources, which can be risky if the module is malicious or compromised.\n- Without further code or context, the overall security risk remains low, but caution should be exercised when importing external modules, especially with wildcard imports.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 for all reports.  \n- **Risk score:** 0.4 is appropriate for report 1; others are acceptable at 0 or 0.5 depending on context.  \n- **Overall:** The code is benign in isolation, but the practice of wildcard import warrants caution.",
