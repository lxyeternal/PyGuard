{
  "purpose": "Import all functions and classes from the 'httptest.httptest' module.",
  "sources": "The source is an import statement, which loads external code at runtime.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe if 'httptest.httptest' is malicious or compromised, as it could execute malicious code upon import.",
  "flows": "The imported module may execute code during import or later during runtime, depending on its content.",
  "anomalies": "The use of a wildcard import ('*') is suspicious, as it obscures what is imported and can hide malicious or unintended functions or code.",
  "analysis": "This code performs a wildcard import from 'httptest.httptest'. While the import itself is not malicious, the lack of specificity prevents assessment of what functions or classes are brought into scope. If 'httptest.httptest' is malicious or compromised, this import could trigger malicious code execution or malicious side effects when used. The source module's reputation and content are unknown, which introduces risk. No other code is provided for further analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no immediate malicious behavior evident. However, the use of wildcard import from an external package introduces security and maintainability risks, especially if the package is malicious or compromised. Due to lack of further context, the overall security risk is moderate, and caution is advised.",
