  "conclusion": "The import statement is benign in isolation, with no direct evidence of malicious activity. The main concern is the use of wildcard import from an external module, which can pose security and maintainability risks if the module is malicious or compromised. Overall, the security risk is low, but caution should be exercised with external dependencies and import practices."
