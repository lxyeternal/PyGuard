      "obfuscated": 0,
      "confidence": 1,
      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script for Python packages. It modifies environment configuration based on CLI input and initiates setup with version control. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The minor dynamic behavior does not constitute a security concern."

      "file_path": "/home2/blue/Documents/PyPIAgent/Dataset/obfuscation/unzip_benign/9817adf894a53ecad4be2bb15eef9fa9b6e4f557/ofkd90qsolnevghn/cli.py",

      "obfuscated": 0.75,
      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "While the code does not demonstrate explicit malicious activity, the obfuscated imports and dynamic invocation suggest potential concealment. The low malware score is appropriate, but high obfuscation warrants caution. Further investigation into the imported functions' implementations is recommended before deployment or trust."

      "malware_score": 0,
      "security_risk": 0.2,
      "obfuscated": 0,
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The import statement is benign in isolation, with no direct evidence of malicious activity. The main concern is the use of wildcard import from an external module, which can pose security and maintainability risks if the module is malicious or compromised. Overall, the security risk is low, but caution should be exercised with external dependencies and import practices."

      "conclusion": "This is a benign testing server for OIDC token issuance with obfuscated code and unconventional practices. It does not contain malware or malicious payloads but should be handled cautiously due to its obfuscation, infinite sleep, and potential for misuse in untrusted environments."

      "conclusion": "The code contains suspicious features—obfuscation, pickle serialization, socket-based control—that could be exploited maliciously, but no direct malicious activity is evident. It warrants cautious review and further analysis before deployment. The malware score is approximately 0.4, obfuscation at 0.75, and overall security risk around 0.5."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code functions as a webhook handler and forwarder with high obfuscation and dynamic behavior. While no active malware is evident, its design—obfuscation, lack of input validation, and external command execution—poses notable security risks that could be exploited if inputs are malicious. The high obfuscation and potential for misuse justify a cautious security assessment."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign test suite with obfuscated identifiers. No malicious activity or supply chain threats are evident. The high obfuscation scores are justified but do not indicate malicious intent. The malware score remains at 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2)."

      "conclusion": "The reports are consistent and justified; the dependency poses minimal security risk with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. Slightly lowering risk scores to 0.1 across reports would improve accuracy, but current scores are acceptable. Overall, the supply chain security posture appears benign."
