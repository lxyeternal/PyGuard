  "conclusion": "The code contains suspicious features—obfuscation, pickle serialization, socket-based control—that could be exploited maliciously, but no direct malicious activity is evident. It warrants cautious review and further analysis before deployment. The malware score is approximately 0.4, obfuscation at 0.75, and overall security risk around 0.5."
