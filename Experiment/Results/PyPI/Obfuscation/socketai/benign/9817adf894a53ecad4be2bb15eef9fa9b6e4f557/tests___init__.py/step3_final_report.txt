  "purpose": "Assess the supply chain security posture of the open source dependency based on provided code analysis reports.",
  "sources": "No actual code provided; analysis based on high-level descriptions and summaries.",
  "sinks": "Potential data flows involving network communication, input handling, or external data processing.",
  "flows": "Untrusted data may flow from input sources to network transmission points or data processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code, minimal risk scores, and no signs of obfuscation or malicious patterns; slight overestimation of risk in some reports.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify the lack of code or malicious indicators, assigning malware and obfuscation scores of 0. Risk scores are generally low (0.2–0.3), reflecting minimal concern. Slight adjustments to risk scores (e.g., lowering from 0.2–0.3 to 0.1) would better align with the absence of concrete threats. Confidence levels are appropriate given the limited information. No suspicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected across reports.",
  "conclusion": "The reports are consistent and justified; the dependency poses minimal security risk with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. Slightly lowering risk scores to 0.1 across reports would improve accuracy, but current scores are acceptable. Overall, the supply chain security posture appears benign.",
