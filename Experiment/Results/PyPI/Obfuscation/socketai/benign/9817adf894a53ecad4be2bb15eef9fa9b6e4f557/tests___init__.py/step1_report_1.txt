  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform a data processing or utility task, but without seeing the actual code, the precise purpose cannot be determined.",
  "sources": "Potential sources include input functions such as 'input()', reading environment variables via 'os.environ', or reading files from disk.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls (e.g., 'requests' library), execution of system commands (e.g., 'os.system', 'subprocess'), or writing sensitive data to files.",
  "flows": "Data flow might be from sources like user input or environment variables to sinks such as network requests or system commands, but specific paths cannot be confirmed without the code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies can be identified without the actual code; potential red flags include hardcoded credentials, unusual string manipulations, or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "Unable to perform detailed analysis due to absence of code content. Cannot identify source-to-sink flows, anomalies, or malicious patterns without code.",
  "conclusion": "Insufficient information to determine malicious intent or security risks. The code appears benign at a structural level, but without the actual code, a definitive assessment cannot be made.",
