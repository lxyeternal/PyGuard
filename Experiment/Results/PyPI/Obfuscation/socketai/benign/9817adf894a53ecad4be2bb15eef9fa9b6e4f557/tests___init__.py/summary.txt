  "conclusion": "The reports are consistent and justified; the dependency poses minimal security risk with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. Slightly lowering risk scores to 0.1 across reports would improve accuracy, but current scores are acceptable. Overall, the supply chain security posture appears benign."
