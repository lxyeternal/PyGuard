  "purpose": "Configure the environment for package installation by setting site.ENABLE_USER_SITE based on CLI arguments and initiate setup with SCM versioning.",
  "sources": "sys.argv[1:] (CLI arguments), import statements (sys, site, setuptools)",
  "sinks": "setuptools.setup() (invocation point), modification of site.ENABLE_USER_SITE",
  "flows": "CLI argument '--user' influences site.ENABLE_USER_SITE, which then affects the setup process",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic modification of site.ENABLE_USER_SITE based on CLI arguments; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, checks for '--user' in command-line arguments, sets site.ENABLE_USER_SITE accordingly, and calls setuptools.setup() with use_scm_version=True. This pattern is typical for Python package setup scripts. No malicious code, data leaks, or obfuscation are present. The dynamic setting of site.ENABLE_USER_SITE is standard practice and not inherently risky, though slightly unusual in some contexts. Overall, the code is straightforward, with no suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script for Python packages. It modifies environment configuration based on CLI input and initiates setup with version control. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The minor dynamic behavior does not constitute a security concern.",
