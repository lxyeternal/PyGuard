  "conclusion": "The code functions as a webhook handler and forwarder with high obfuscation and dynamic behavior. While no active malware is evident, its design—obfuscation, lack of input validation, and external command execution—poses notable security risks that could be exploited if inputs are malicious. The high obfuscation and potential for misuse justify a cautious security assessment."
