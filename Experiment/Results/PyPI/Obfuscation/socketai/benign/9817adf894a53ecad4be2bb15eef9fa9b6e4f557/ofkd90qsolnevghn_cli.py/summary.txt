  "security_risk": 0.35,

  "conclusion": "While the code does not demonstrate explicit malicious activity, the obfuscated imports and dynamic invocation suggest potential concealment. The low malware score is appropriate, but high obfuscation warrants caution. Further investigation into the imported functions' implementations is recommended before deployment or trust."
