The obfuscation may be stylistic or intended to obscure details but does not indicate malicious intent. The current scores are appropriate: malware=0, obfuscated=0.7, securityRisk=0.2."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion due to obfuscation, dynamic import/download, and use of an undefined object. It could facilitate malicious activity if the imported module or object is malicious. Scores should reflect elevated risk and malware potential, with malware score around 0.7, obfuscation at 0.8, and overall security risk approximately 0.75."
