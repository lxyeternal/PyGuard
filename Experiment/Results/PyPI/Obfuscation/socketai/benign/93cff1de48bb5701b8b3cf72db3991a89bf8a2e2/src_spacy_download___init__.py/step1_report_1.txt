  "purpose": "Importing a function or variable named 'fQLlTxYrUZGwhpVsZhjNwYYFBiTLnOXW' from a local module 'load'.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads data from a local module file 'load'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks observed; no untrusted data handling or output shown.",
  "flows": "Data flow is limited to importing the specified item; no further data flow is present.",
  "anomalies": "The imported name 'fQLlTxYrUZGwhpVsZhjNwYYFBiTLnOXW' is a nonsensical, obfuscated-looking identifier, which could indicate obfuscation or malicious intent. No other code or context provided.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single import statement from a local module. The imported name appears to be a random string, which is suspicious and could be an indicator of obfuscated or malicious code. Since no additional code, data sources, or sinks are present, there are no further signs of malicious behavior. The code itself is minimal, but the obfuscated name warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet by itself is not inherently malicious but uses an obfuscated identifier that could be part of an attempt to hide malicious intent. Without additional context, the risk is uncertain, but the obfuscation raises suspicion.",
