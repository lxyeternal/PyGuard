  "purpose": "Import a function or object named 'fQLlTxYrUZGwhpVsZhjNwYYFBiTLnOXW' from a local module 'load'.",
  "sources": "Import statement, which reads a specific attribute from a relative module.",
  "sinks": "None present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; only a single import statement without data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "The imported name 'fQLlTxYrUZGwhpVsZhjNwYYFBiTLnOXW' appears as a randomly generated string, indicating possible obfuscation or an attempt to hide intent. The module name 'load' is generic and could be legitimate or malicious. No other code is provided to evaluate further behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a single import statement importing a function or variable with an obfuscated or nonsensical name from a local module. There are no other code elements, so no data flows or behaviors can be assessed beyond the suspicion of obfuscation. The naming pattern raises suspicion but does not, by itself, indicate malicious intent. No signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attack are evident from this snippet alone.",
  "conclusion": "This minimal code snippet involves a simple import with an obfuscated name, which could be benign or an attempt to hide malicious activity. With only this line, there is no definitive evidence of malicious behavior, but the obfuscated name warrants caution if found in a larger context.",
