  "purpose": "Import a function or object named 'fQLlTxYrUZGwhpVsZhjNwYYFBiTLnOXW' from a local module 'load'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module file 'load'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sink or data leak points evident in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Imports the specified entity from a local module; no data flow analysis possible with this single line.",
  "anomalies": "Unusually named import ('fQLlTxYrUZGwhpVsZhjNwYYFBiTLnOXW') suggests obfuscation or a generated name, which is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single import statement importing an entity with an obfuscated name from a relative module 'load'. The name does not follow typical naming conventions and may be used to hide malicious intent or obfuscate functionality. No other code is present to analyze, and the context suggests the potential for hidden or malicious code within the imported object or module. No other anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detectable in this isolated line.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement uses an obfuscated name, which could be indicative of malicious intent or code obfuscation. However, with only this line, there is no definitive evidence of malicious behavior, but caution is advised. Further review of the 'load' module and the imported object is recommended.",
