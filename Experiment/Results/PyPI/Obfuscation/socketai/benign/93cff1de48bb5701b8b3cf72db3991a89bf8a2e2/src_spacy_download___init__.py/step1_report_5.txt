  "purpose": "Import a specific function or class from a local module named 'load'.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads from a local module file 'load'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only performs a local import.",
  "anomalies": "The imported identifier 'fQLlTxYrUZGwhpVsZhjNwYYFBiTLnOXW' appears to be a randomly generated or obfuscated name, which could be an anomaly. However, it could also be a legitimate obfuscated identifier or auto-generated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single import statement importing a symbol with an obfuscated or random name from a local module. There are no other code statements, data flows, or external communications. The import itself is standard Python syntax, but the use of an obfuscated identifier raises suspicion of code obfuscation or potential malicious intent. Nonetheless, without further context, it could be legitimate obfuscation or simply an auto-generated name.\n\nThere are no external data sources, no suspicious functions, and no network or file operations visible. The code's sole purpose appears to be importing a specific element, possibly used later in the larger codebase.",
  "conclusion": "This minimal code snippet only performs a local import of a potentially obfuscated identifier. There is no immediate evidence of malicious behavior. The obfuscated name warrants caution but does not definitively indicate malicious intent based solely on this snippet. Further context from the rest of the package is needed for a definitive assessment.",
