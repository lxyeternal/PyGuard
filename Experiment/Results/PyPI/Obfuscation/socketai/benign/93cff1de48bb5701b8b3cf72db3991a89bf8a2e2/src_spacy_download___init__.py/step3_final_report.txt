{
  "purpose": "Importing an obfuscated-named entity from a local module 'load'.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no data input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows; the code only imports a module component.",
  "flows": "No data flow beyond the import statement; no source-to-sink paths.",
  "anomalies": "The imported name 'fQLlTxYrUZGwhpVsZhjNwYYFBiTLnOXW' appears highly obfuscated and nonsensical.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, syntactically correct import statement from a local module. The imported identifier is obfuscated, which raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. No evidence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or external communication is present. The obfuscation could be due to auto-generated code or attempts to hide malicious payloads. The scores assigned in the reports reflect high obfuscation suspicion but low malware likelihood, which is appropriate given the limited context. Further review of the 'load' module is recommended to determine the nature of the imported entity.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is benign in isolation but the obfuscated name warrants further investigation. There is no direct evidence of malicious activity, and the current scores are consistent with a cautious but low-threat assessment.",
