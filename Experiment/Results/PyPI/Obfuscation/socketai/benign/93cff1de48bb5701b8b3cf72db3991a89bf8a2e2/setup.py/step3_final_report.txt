  "purpose": "Package setup configuration for a Python project, defining metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Static strings assigned to setup() parameters, including package name, version, description, keywords, license, classifiers, project URLs, python_requires, install_requires, extras_require.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data input or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration data used solely for package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names (e.g., 'WrEcrXnAlLSWYVXQBZLGvvAXHQaIKWbD', 'prztWipHlVWBaNFaVLgrjRATvtUkVRte') used as parameter values; inconsistent formatting or line breaks in the code snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script with superficial obfuscation through variable names. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input is present. The obfuscation appears stylistic or to conceal details but does not constitute malicious behavior. The static metadata is typical for package configuration. Scores assigned by reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0.6-0.7, securityRisk=0.1-0.3) are consistent with the absence of active malicious code but acknowledge superficial obfuscation. No evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration is observed. The obfuscation alone does not imply malicious intent, and the code's purpose remains benign.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a standard package setup script with superficial obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. The obfuscation may be stylistic or intended to obscure details but does not indicate malicious intent. The current scores are appropriate: malware=0, obfuscated=0.7, securityRisk=0.2.",
