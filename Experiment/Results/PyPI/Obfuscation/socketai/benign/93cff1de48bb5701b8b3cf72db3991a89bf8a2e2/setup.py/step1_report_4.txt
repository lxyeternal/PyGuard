{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'ezf020mt103u3bd8', primarily for NLP and spaCy extension development.",
  "sources": "Code reads static data such as package name, version, metadata, dependencies, URLs, and Python version requirements.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external data output observed.",
  "flows": "The data flows from static definitions (package info, dependencies, URLs) into the setup() function, with no dynamic or external input involved.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated or nonsensical variable names like 'WrEcrXnAlLSWYVXQBZLGvvAXHQaIKWbD' and 'prztWipHlVWBaNFaVLgrjRATvtUkVRte'. The code does not include dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs. The variable names seem intentionally obscured but are used as static data.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration with intentionally obscured variable names, likely to conceal the actual metadata. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or network activity. The code is straightforward and only defines package configuration details. The obfuscation appears superficial, possibly for stylistic reasons or to prevent easy readability, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a typical setup script for a Python package, with superficial obfuscation of variable names. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The overall security risk is minimal.",
