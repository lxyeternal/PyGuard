  "purpose": "The code only specifies the encoding format as utf-8; it does not perform any operational tasks or data processing.",
  "sources": "No sources of input or data are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling points are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or processing flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a single encoding declaration comment, which is benign and standard; no anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is a minimal, standard encoding declaration comment often found at the top of Python files. It does not include any logic, data input, or output. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. Since it contains only a comment, there are no sources, sinks, or data flows. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a standard encoding declaration with no operational or malicious content. It poses no security threat or malicious behavior.",
