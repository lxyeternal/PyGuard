  "purpose": "This code contains only a comment declaring UTF-8 encoding, serving as a minimal header or placeholder.",
  "sources": "No data input or output; only a comment line.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data or control flow; only a static comment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscation; trivial content.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single comment line specifying UTF-8 encoding, with no executable code, data handling, or logic. It does not perform any operations, access external resources, or contain any patterns indicative of malicious behavior. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the benign and trivial nature of the snippet. The confidence in this assessment is high, given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security concerns. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the content. No further action or adjustment is necessary.",
