  "purpose": "The provided code is a single comment line indicating UTF-8 encoding. It does not contain any functional code or logic.",
  "sources": "None",
  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "None",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a comment about encoding, with no executable statements or data input points.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a comment specifying the file encoding as UTF-8. There are no functions, data inputs, outputs, or other executable elements present. As such, it does not perform any actions, read data, or process information. Since there is no executable code, there are no source-to-sink flows or potential security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a trivial file containing only an encoding declaration comment. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated.",
