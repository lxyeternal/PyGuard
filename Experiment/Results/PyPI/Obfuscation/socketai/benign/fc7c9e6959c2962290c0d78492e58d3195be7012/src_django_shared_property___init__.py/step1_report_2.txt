    "No apparent data sinks, external data outputs, or untrusted data handling"

  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the variables are statically assigned",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs observed",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns hardcoded string values to variables, which include a name, an email address, and a version string. There are no functions, input/output operations, network connections, or dynamic code execution present. No suspicious patterns or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be benign, serving as a simple set of variable assignments possibly for identification or metadata. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
