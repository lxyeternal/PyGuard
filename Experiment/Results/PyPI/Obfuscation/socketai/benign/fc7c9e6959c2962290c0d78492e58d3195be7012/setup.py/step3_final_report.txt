  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for a Python package, defining package metadata and configuration.",
  "sources": "Static variables containing package info, such as package name, version, description, author, and package data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no network or file operations beyond setup invocation.",
  "flows": "The setup() function consumes the defined variables to configure package installation.",
  "anomalies": "The 'long_description' variable is assigned without a value, causing a syntax error; variable names are obfuscated but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with superficial obfuscation. The primary issue is a syntax error due to incomplete 'long_description' assignment, which would prevent execution. No malicious behaviors, network activity, or security risks are evident. Obfuscation appears superficial and not malicious. The malware score is correctly set to 0. The obfuscation score is moderate (~0.6), reflecting variable name obscurity. The security risk score is very low (~0.1), as the only problem is a syntax error, not a security vulnerability.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with a syntax error and superficial obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious intent or malware. The main action needed is fixing the syntax error to ensure proper execution. The scores are appropriate; malware remains at 0, obfuscation is moderate, and risk is minimal.",
