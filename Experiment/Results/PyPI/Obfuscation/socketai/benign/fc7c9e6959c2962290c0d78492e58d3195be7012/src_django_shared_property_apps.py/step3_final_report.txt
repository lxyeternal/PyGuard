{
  "purpose": "The code initializes environment variables, imports standard modules, and performs data processing or system interactions typical of benign scripts.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, user input, or files; possibly network or subprocess calls.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks through network communication, subprocess outputs, or environment variables; no evidence of malicious data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Input sources (environment variables, user input) to processing functions, possibly involving network or subprocess calls, but no malicious data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets observed; minor mentions of network or dynamic execution are cautious but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets are standard, involving environment setup, module imports, and data handling. No malicious payloads, obfuscation, or backdoors are evident. The cautious notes about network or subprocess calls reflect potential risk but lack concrete malicious activity. Scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2-0.3) are consistent with the benign nature. Confidence levels are high, and no anomalies suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scoring is appropriate, and continued vigilance is recommended if further code reveals dynamic or network activities.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.2,
