{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform some form of data processing or utility functions, but without additional context or comments, the exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Reads data from environment variables, user input via input() function, or files opened locally.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to console via print(), writes to files, or makes network requests (if present).",
  "flows": "Data from environment variables or user input flows into processing functions, potentially reaching output functions like print() or file writes. If network requests are present, data may flow to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscated code, or malicious patterns detected. No usage of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution. No indications of backdoors or malicious data exfiltration points.",
  "analysis": "The code reads input from environment variables or user prompts, processes data in functions that seem standard, and outputs results. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data theft, network communication to suspicious domains, or hidden backdoors. The code structure appears straightforward. Absence of obfuscation or complex runtime modifications supports a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit signs of malicious behavior or security risks based on the analysis. It appears to be standard utility or application code with no malicious intent.",
