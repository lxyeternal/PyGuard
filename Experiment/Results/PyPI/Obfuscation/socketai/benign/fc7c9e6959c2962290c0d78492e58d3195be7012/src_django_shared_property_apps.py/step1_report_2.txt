  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be related to data processing or communication, possibly for a network or system management task.",
  "sources": "Data is read from environment variables and potentially from imported modules. No explicit user input or external data sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or system commands if present. However, no obvious dangerous sinks are observed in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or internal variables to functions or modules that may perform operations like network communication or system modifications. No explicit source-to-sink paths are clearly identified in the given code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network addresses, or unusual code structures are evident. The code uses standard modules and constructs. No obfuscated or intentionally confusing code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be standard Python with typical module imports and variable usage. There are no signs of malicious intent, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious system modifications. The absence of dangerous function calls, network activity, or cryptic obfuscation suggests a benign purpose. Since the code snippet is minimal and straightforward, no anomalies or malicious patterns are identified. The overall structure indicates legitimate usage without security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign with no suspicious activity or security vulnerabilities detected.",
