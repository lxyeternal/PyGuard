{
  "purpose": "The code appears to initialize a Python environment and perform some operations involving environment variables and package imports, likely for application setup or configuration.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, imported modules, possibly user input or system data during import and execution.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive data output (e.g., environment variables), system commands if invoked, network connections if present in imported modules, or file writes.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or system data sources through code logic to outputs or system calls, possibly via imported modules.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or malicious payloads are evident. The code structure and imports are standard. No obfuscated code features detected. No unusual dynamic execution or misleading variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports standard libraries and accesses environment variables. No evidence of data exfiltration, malicious network activity, or backdoors. The pattern appears to be normal initialization. No suspicious code patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious functions identified. Lack of external or suspicious network calls or command executions suggests a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code appears benign with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as a typical setup or configuration script without malicious behavior.",
