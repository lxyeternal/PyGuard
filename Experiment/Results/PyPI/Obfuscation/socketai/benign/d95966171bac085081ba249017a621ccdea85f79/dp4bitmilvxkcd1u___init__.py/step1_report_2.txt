{
  "purpose": "This code conditionally imports date and time utility functions from different modules depending on the presence of __pypy__ for date/time handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads the presence of the __pypy__ module, which influences which import paths are used.",
  "sinks": "The code imports functions for date/time manipulation; no untrusted data sinks are explicitly present.",
  "flows": "The presence or absence of __pypy__ influences which module is imported, determining the source of date/time functions.",
  "anomalies": "The code employs obscure variable names, conditional imports based on a module's presence, but does not execute any malicious code or perform suspicious operations.",
  "analysis": "The code first tries to import __pypy__, and based on whether that succeeds, it imports date/time functions from different modules. The variable naming is obscure, but the logic is straightforward. No hardcoded credentials, no code injection, and no malicious behavior are detected. The imported functions are standard date/time utilities. The code appears to be a compatibility layer for different Python environments (PyPy vs standard Python). There are no external data inputs or suspicious flows, and no obfuscation beyond naming. The code does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a compatibility shim for date/time functions, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is standard practice to handle environment-specific imports and does not pose a supply chain threat.",
