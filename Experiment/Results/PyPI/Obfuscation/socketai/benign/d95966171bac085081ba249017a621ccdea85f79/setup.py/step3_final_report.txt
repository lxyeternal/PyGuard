  "purpose": "Setup script for configuring and installing a Python package, including dependency management, environment detection, and optional C extension compilation.",
  "sources": "Reads external files ('requirements.txt', 'version.txt', 'README.md'), environment variables (__pypy__, sys.version_info), and defines setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; external files are read without validation, which could be exploited if files are maliciously altered.",
  "flows": "Reads external files -> processes environment detection -> conditionally compiles extension -> calls setup() with parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names, reliance on external files without validation, and conditional compilation logic that could conceal malicious intent but appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with obfuscation and environment detection. No network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications are present. External files are read without validation, which could be a vector if compromised, but this is common in such scripts. Obfuscation is likely stylistic or for concealment, not malicious. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0.6, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior. No evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, or sabotage is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, obfuscated setup configuration with no malicious activity. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not indicate malicious intent. External file trustworthiness should be verified, but the code itself is benign.",
