  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, configuring dependencies, extensions, and metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading from requirements.txt, version.txt, and README.md files; detecting environment (PyPy or Python 2/3).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; setup parameters are static or read from files.",
  "flows": "Reading files -> configuring package parameters -> calling setup() with static data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names (e.g., iTbNwZLpoHmJMGXPrSJaCtTOjeTdqFik, WOTXFctWCRNqOqHfczdOhTxxdQJnKKGN), which may suggest obfuscation or concealment. The code imports __pypy__, but does not use it; this might be benign or a sign of concealment. The code constructs a C extension only if not PyPy, which is standard. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. The obfuscated variable names and the dynamic extension compilation are unusual but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script reads external files (requirements.txt, version.txt, README.md), which is typical for setup scripts. It detects the Python environment, including PyPy, and conditionally configures a C extension. The code includes obfuscated variable names, which may indicate an attempt to conceal logic or evade simple static analysis. However, there are no network calls, system modifications, or suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, command execution, or malicious backdoors. The code appears to be a typical setup script with some obfuscation that does not suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard setup script with some obfuscated variable names and environment detection. There are no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks within this code segment. The obfuscation could be for concealment or code protection, but it does not appear harmful based on this analysis.",
