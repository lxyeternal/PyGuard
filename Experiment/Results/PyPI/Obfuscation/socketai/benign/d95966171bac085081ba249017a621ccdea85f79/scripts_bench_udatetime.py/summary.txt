  "conclusion": "The code appears to be an obfuscated date/time utility or benchmarking script with no concrete evidence of malicious activity. The heavy obfuscation and suspicious method calls warrant caution, but in its current form, it does not demonstrate active malware. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with this assessment."
