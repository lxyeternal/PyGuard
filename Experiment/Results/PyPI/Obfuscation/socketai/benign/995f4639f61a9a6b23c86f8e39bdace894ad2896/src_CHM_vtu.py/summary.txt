  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated geospatial data processing script with no direct evidence of malicious activity. The primary concern is the obfuscation, which could be exploited to hide malicious behavior, but as-is, the malware risk is low. It should be reviewed further in a controlled environment, and efforts to de-obfuscate would aid in better assessment."
