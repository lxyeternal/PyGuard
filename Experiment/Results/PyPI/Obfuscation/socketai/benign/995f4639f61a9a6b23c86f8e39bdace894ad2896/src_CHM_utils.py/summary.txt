  "conclusion": "The script is a complex, obfuscated geospatial data processing utility. There is no evidence of malware, network activity, or malicious behavior. The obfuscation and suspicious code patterns suggest caution, but overall, it appears to be a legitimate data conversion tool with high obfuscation. The security risk is low to moderate, primarily due to obfuscation and code complexity."
