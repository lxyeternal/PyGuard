  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be a standard Python script, potentially for data processing or utility functions, but no explicit purpose is clearly stated or discernible from the provided code.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function arguments, possibly environment variables, or imported modules. No external input sources such as network, user input, or files are explicitly shown in the snippet.",
  "sinks": "The code does not clearly show any data being sent over the network, written to sensitive files, or executing system commands. No obvious sinks are present that could lead to data leakage or system compromise.",
  "flows": "There are no apparent source-to-sink data flows; the code's logic is straightforward and does not involve untrusted data processing or propagation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are observed. The code is clean, straightforward, and lacks suspicious constructs or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "A detailed review reveals no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The code structure is simple, with no complex or obfuscated sections. No external network activity, credential handling, or potentially harmful operations are present. The code functions as a benign utility or processing script, with no anomalies indicating malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code shows no evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a safe, straightforward implementation without obfuscation or malicious intent.",
