  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, security risks, and obfuscation.",
  "sources": "Code input/output functions, network connections, environment variables, file operations, data processing routines.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission points, file writes, environment variable access, data leaks, system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input sources (e.g., user input, environment variables) to sinks (e.g., network, file system) via data processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code, lack of suspicious patterns, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation indicators, no network connections or data exfiltration detected.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is missing or empty, preventing detailed static analysis. The reports correctly identify the absence of malicious activity and assign low or zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. High confidence scores in reports with presumed benign code are justified given the lack of suspicious signals. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are evident. The assessments are consistent with the evidence, and the scores align with the conclusions.",
  "conclusion": "All reports are accurate and consistent with the available information. The absence of code precludes further analysis, and the low scores reflect minimal security concern. No adjustments are necessary.",
