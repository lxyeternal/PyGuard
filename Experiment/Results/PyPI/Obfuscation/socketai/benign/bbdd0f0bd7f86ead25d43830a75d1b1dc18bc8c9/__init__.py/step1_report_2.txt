{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific classes or functions from modules within the 'table_meta' package and defines a list of exported symbols.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'table_meta.model', 'table_meta.ddl_to_meta', and 'table_meta.models_to_meta'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; the code only performs imports and defines '__all__'.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the imported modules to the current namespace via import statements; no runtime data processing is present.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated-looking class/function names that seem intentionally nonspecific; no configuration or secrets are present. No dynamic code execution, eval, or similar constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements importing classes/functions with seemingly obfuscated names from a package named 'table_meta'. The '__all__' list controls exports. There are no visible security issues, no dynamic execution, and no hardcoded credentials or secrets. The obfuscated class/function names could indicate code obfuscation or just non-descriptive naming, but on their own, they do not imply malicious intent. The code does not perform any data processing, network activity, or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward module import and export definition, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscated names are suspicious but not necessarily malicious. Overall, the code appears benign.",
