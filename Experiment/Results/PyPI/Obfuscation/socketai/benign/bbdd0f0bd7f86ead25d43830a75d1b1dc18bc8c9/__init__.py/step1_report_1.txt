  "purpose": "Import specific classes and functions from modules within the 'table_meta' package for use in the current context.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'table_meta.model', 'table_meta.ddl_to_meta', and 'table_meta.models_to_meta' modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leakage are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis is applicable as there is no data processing, only imports and __all__ declaration.",
  "anomalies": "The imported class names appear as random strings, which is unusual but not inherently malicious; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code only consists of import statements importing classes with obfuscated-looking names from the 'table_meta' package, and an __all__ declaration to specify public API. There are no functions, data processing, or dynamic code execution. The class names being seemingly random strings might suggest obfuscation, but it is not necessarily malicious. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is detectable. The imports could be part of a larger legitimate project, or they could be intentionally obfuscated.",
  "conclusion": "The code is limited to importing obfuscated class names and defining the module's public interface. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet. The obfuscated class names alone are not sufficient to determine malicious intent but warrant caution if further context reveals nefarious purposes.",
