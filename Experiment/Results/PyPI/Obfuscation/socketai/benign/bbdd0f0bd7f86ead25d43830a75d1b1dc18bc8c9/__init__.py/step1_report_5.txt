{
  "purpose": "Import modules and classes from the 'table_meta' package and define public API symbols",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'table_meta.model', 'table_meta.ddl_to_meta', and 'table_meta.models_to_meta'",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data, but potential for dynamic import or execution if module paths are manipulated",
  "flows": "Imports are static and do not process untrusted input; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Unusually obfuscated class names that seem randomly generated; no explicit malicious code or hidden behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with highly obfuscated class names and a list defining public symbols. There is no evidence of code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior. The obfuscated class names suggest possible code concealment, but without dynamic code execution or network activity, this appears benign. The code serves as an interface to import specific classes from the 'table_meta' package, likely as part of a larger application. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward import statement module with obfuscated class names. No malicious intent or security risks are evident. The obfuscation may be for code concealment but does not indicate malicious activity.",
