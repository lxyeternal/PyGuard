  "purpose": "Import specific classes and modules from a package named 'table_meta' and define __all__ for module exports.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'table_meta.model', 'table_meta.ddl_to_meta', and 'table_meta.models_to_meta'.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "flows": "Imported modules are assigned to local names; no data flows or processing visible beyond imports.",
  "anomalies": "Imported class names are obfuscated or nonsensical, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code behavior present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and a __all__ declaration. The imported names appear to be randomly generated or obfuscated, which could be a sign of code hiding or obfuscation, but does not itself indicate malicious intent. There are no apparent data flows, input handling, or execution logic. The absence of code logic limits the scope of analysis, but nothing suspicious or malicious is evident in these lines.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply imports modules with obfuscated names and declares exports. No malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks are detectable based on this snippet. The obfuscated naming warrants caution, but it is not inherently malicious.",
