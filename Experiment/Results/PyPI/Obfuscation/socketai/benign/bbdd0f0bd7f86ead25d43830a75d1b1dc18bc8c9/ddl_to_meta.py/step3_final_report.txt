{
  "purpose": "The function processes input data containing 'tables' and 'types' by instantiating external classes with unpacked dictionaries and assembling them into a result dictionary.",
  "sources": "Input data keys 'tables' and 'types', from which dictionaries are read for class instantiation.",
  "sinks": "Class constructors invoked with unpacked data; potential for malicious behavior if classes are malicious or data is crafted to exploit class constructors.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input dictionaries into class constructors via unpacking, then into the result structure.",
  "anomalies": "No input validation or sanitization; external class names are obfuscated, and class implementations are unknown, which could conceal malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward data processing by instantiating classes with external data without validation. The class names are obfuscated, imported from an external module, and could contain malicious code that executes during instantiation. The lack of validation or sanitization introduces potential security risks if malicious classes or data are provided. The code itself does not contain malicious behavior such as network activity or file manipulation. The obfuscation and external dependencies increase suspicion but do not confirm malicious intent. The malware score should be low, but the risk score should be moderate due to the potential for exploitation through malicious class implementations. The confidence in this assessment is high, given the code structure and lack of evidence of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple data transformation routine with obfuscated class names and no validation, posing a moderate security risk if the external classes are malicious. There is no direct evidence of malware, but the lack of validation and obfuscated dependencies warrant caution.",
