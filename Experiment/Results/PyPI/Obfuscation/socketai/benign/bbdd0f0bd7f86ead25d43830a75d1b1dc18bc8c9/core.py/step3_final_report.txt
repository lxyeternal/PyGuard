  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, user inputs, files, network connections, and module imports.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file operations, environment variable access, system commands, and data outputs.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or user inputs flow into processing functions, with outputs directed to network, files, or system commands.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious functions; code appears benign.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify minimal or no code, with no malicious or obfuscated patterns. The scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0.2) are consistent with their benign descriptions. Confidence levels are appropriate given the limited code context. No discrepancies or red flags are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code samples are assessed as non-malicious, non-obfuscated, with minor inherent risks related to environment or network operations. The scoring is justified and aligns with the descriptions. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
