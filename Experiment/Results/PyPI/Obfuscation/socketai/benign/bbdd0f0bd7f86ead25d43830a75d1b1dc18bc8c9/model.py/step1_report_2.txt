  "purpose": "Define various Pydantic data models for data schema validation and configuration.",
  "sources": "Data input from user or external data sources fed into the models, especially during object creation and validation.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive data stored or manipulated within the models, such as dictionaries, environment variables, or external data references.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input (model instantiation) through validators and property methods, potentially updating or referencing internal dicts and attributes.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of validator that converts numeric strings to integers; use of optional dictionaries with no default values; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of Pydantic models used for schema validation with various optional fields. The validator converts string numerics to integers, which is a benign data normalization. No suspicious network activity, file manipulation, or code execution is present. The models include attributes for database schema or configuration-like data. The inclusion of optional dictionaries and fields does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are apparent. The code structure is standard for data models, with no signs of obfuscation or malware. The only notable point is the validator's conversion, which is a common pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard schema/model definitions using Pydantic with no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or supply chain attacks. It’s a typical setup for data validation and configuration management.",
