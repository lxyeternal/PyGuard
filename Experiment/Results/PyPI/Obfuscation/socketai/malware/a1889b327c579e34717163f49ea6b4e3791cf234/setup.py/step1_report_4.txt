  "flows": "Variables assigned values -> setup() function uses variables for package configuration",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variable names (e.g., NNkZFtVqEpDlvSWGgRijgOKIhKlToZBM), inconsistent variable naming, and unusual variable assignments; no direct malicious code execution or data leaks detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and 'os', defines a directory path, and assigns several variables with obfuscated names and seemingly random strings. The setup() function is called with standard package metadata, but some variable names are nonsensical, which could be an attempt to hide malicious intent. There is no evidence of data exfiltration, backdoors, network activity, or malicious behavior within this snippet. The use of obfuscated variable names raises suspicion but may also be an attempt to avoid straightforward detection. Overall, the code appears to be a benign package setup with some obfuscated naming, lacking any malicious or maliciously malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with obfuscated variable names. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The obfuscation alone does not indicate malicious intent, but it warrants caution. Overall, it is a benign setup script with no clear malicious activity.",
