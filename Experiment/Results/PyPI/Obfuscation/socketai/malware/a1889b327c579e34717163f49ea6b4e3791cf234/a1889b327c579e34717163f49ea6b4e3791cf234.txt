      "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a benign, obfuscated setup script with no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. The obfuscation is superficial and does not indicate malicious intent. The package name and string content are likely placeholders. Overall, the code is safe, with scores reflecting superficial obfuscation but no malicious activity."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing external content without validation, representing a high security threat. Despite technical flaws and outdated practices, the core malicious intent is clear. The high malware and risk scores are justified, and the code should be flagged for further review or removal."
