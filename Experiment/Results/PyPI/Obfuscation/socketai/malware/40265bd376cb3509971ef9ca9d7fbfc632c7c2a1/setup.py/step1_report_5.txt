  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, potentially with embedded malicious behavior through code execution.",
  "sources": "os.path.exists('tahg'), subprocess.Popen() with encoded PowerShell command",
  "sinks": "subprocess.Popen() executing encoded PowerShell command, potential writing or executing arbitrary code",
  "flows": "Check if 'tahg' does not exist -> execute encoded PowerShell command via subprocess",
  "anomalies": "Encoded PowerShell command executed through subprocess without validation, silent try-except blocks, no comments or documentation explaining the purpose, use of potentially obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup functions and attempts to execute a PowerShell command encoded in base64 if the file 'tahg' does not exist. The command appears to be encoded, which is suspicious as it could hide malicious payloads. The subprocess is launched with no window and in the background, which indicates an attempt to hide execution. The use of try-except blocks without logging or error handling further obscures intent. The setup function defines package metadata but does not appear inherently malicious, but the embedded code execution raises concerns about malicious behavior. The overall code suggests an attempt to hide malicious activity within a setup process, possibly to execute remote commands or payloads silently.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains suspicious behavior by executing encoded PowerShell commands silently during setup, indicating potential malicious intent or backdoor functionality. The obfuscated PowerShell command warrants further analysis to confirm its payload.",
