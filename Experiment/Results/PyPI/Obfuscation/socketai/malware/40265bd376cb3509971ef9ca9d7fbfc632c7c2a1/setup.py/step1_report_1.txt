{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up a Python package and execute a hidden PowerShell command if a specific directory ('tahg') does not exist.",
  "sources": "Reading the filesystem (os.path.exists), executing subprocess (subprocess.Popen), importing modules (distutils.core, subprocess, os)",
  "sinks": "subprocess.Popen executes a command that can run arbitrary code; no other sinks are directly present",
  "flows": "Checks for 'tahg' directory -> executes hidden PowerShell command if absent",
  "anomalies": "The PowerShell command is encoded in Base64, suggesting obfuscation; the command runs a script from a suspicious URL or resource; use of subprocess with CREATE_NO_WINDOW to hide activity; minimal exception handling hides errors",
  "analysis": "The script begins by importing setup tools and then attempts to import subprocess and os. It checks whether a directory 'tahg' exists. If not, it runs a PowerShell command encoded in Base64 using subprocess.Popen with hidden window flags. The encoded command appears to be a PowerShell script intended to run silently, likely downloading or executing further payloads. The setup function is called with package details, but within a try-except block, ignoring potential errors. The overall pattern of hiding execution and obfuscated payloads indicates malicious intent or backdoor behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated PowerShell that executes silently without user awareness, likely downloading or executing malicious payloads. The setup configuration appears benign but is wrapped in try-except, possibly to conceal errors. Overall, this code exhibits suspicious behavior suggestive of malware with hidden execution of remote scripts.",
