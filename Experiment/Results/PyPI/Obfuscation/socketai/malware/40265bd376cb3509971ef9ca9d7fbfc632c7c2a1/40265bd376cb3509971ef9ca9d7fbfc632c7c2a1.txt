      "conclusion": "The code contains a hidden, obfuscated PowerShell command executed during setup, which is a common indicator of malicious or backdoor activity. The silent execution, obfuscation, and minimal error handling increase suspicion of malware. While the package setup itself is benign, the embedded payload behavior is highly suspicious and warrants further analysis, such as decoding the Base64 command to confirm malicious intent."
