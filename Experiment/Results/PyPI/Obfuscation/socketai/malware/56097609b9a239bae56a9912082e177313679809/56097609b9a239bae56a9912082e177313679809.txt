      "conclusion": "The code exhibits highly suspicious, likely malicious behavior by decrypting and executing hidden code during package installation on Windows. The encrypted payload and dynamic execution strongly indicate malicious intent, justifying high malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores. All reports correctly identify these issues, and their scoring is appropriate."
