{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package, with a custom installation command that executes a decryption and code execution step during installation on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables and imports modules such as 'os', 'requests', and 'fernet'. The 'exec' function executes decrypted code obtained via Fernet encryption during the install process.",
  "sinks": "The 'exec' function executes decrypted code, which could potentially be malicious if the decrypted payload is harmful or malicious code.",
  "flows": "During installation on Windows ('nt'), the script imports 'requests' and 'Fernet', then decrypts a payload and executes it via 'exec'. This decrypted payload could perform any arbitrary action. The source of input is the encrypted payload, which is then decrypted and executed as code.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of encrypted payload and execution of decrypted code at install time is suspicious. The use of Fernet for encryption/decryption combined with code execution raises concern. The encrypted data and key are embedded in the code. The code appears obfuscated and designed to run potentially malicious code during install.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom install class that, during installation on Windows systems, imports 'requests' and 'Fernet', then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted string, and executes it via 'exec'. The encrypted payload and key are embedded directly in the code, which is unusual and suspicious. The use of 'exec' on decrypted data indicates potential malicious activity, such as code injection or backdoor installation. The overall structure suggests an attempt to hide malicious behavior within an obfuscated and encrypted payload that is decrypted at runtime, which is a common tactic in malicious packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains suspicious behavior, notably the encrypted payload that is decrypted and executed during package installation, indicating potential malicious intent. This behavior could be used to execute arbitrary malicious code on Windows systems during package installation, constituting a security risk.",
