{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup configuration that includes a custom installation command to execute remote code under certain conditions.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables (os.name), imports modules (requests, fernet), and reads hardcoded encrypted data within the Fernet decryption call.",
  "sinks": "The decrypted Fernet data is executed as Python code with exec(), which could run malicious code if the decryption output is malicious.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves the install method checking OS, then decrypting and executing code via exec(), indicating a source-to-sink path from Fernet decryption to code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded encrypted data intended for decryption and execution, conditional code execution based on OS, use of exec() on decrypted data, which is a common indicator of malicious behavior. The overall structure is obfuscated, with cryptic variable names and encrypted payloads.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up a Python package with potentially malicious custom install behavior. During installation on Windows (nt), it decrypts a payload using Fernet and executes it with exec(), which could execute malicious code. The use of encrypted data and dynamic code execution suggests malicious intent. The package metadata and setup configuration are normal, but the install method's behavior is suspicious and indicates a possible backdoor or malicious payload being installed silently.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a hidden malicious behavior designed to decrypt and execute remote code during installation on Windows systems. The encrypted payload and use of exec() are classic indicators of malicious intent. The overall security risk is high due to this backdoor-like behavior.",
