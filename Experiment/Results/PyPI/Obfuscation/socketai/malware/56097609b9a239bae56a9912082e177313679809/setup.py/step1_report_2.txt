  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup configuration that installs a specific package and executes potentially malicious code during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables, checks for OS type, imports modules like requests and fernet, and executes decryption of hardcoded encrypted data.",
  "sinks": "The decrypted data is executed as code via exec(), which could lead to arbitrary code execution on the system.",
  "flows": "The code flow starts with package setup, then upon installation, if OS is Windows, it imports modules and decrypts encrypted data, which is then executed with exec(), potentially leading to malicious code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of encrypted payload decrypted and executed dynamically; use of hardcoded encrypted string and secret key; execution of exec() on decrypted content; obfuscated variable and class names; deployment of potentially malicious code during package installation.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a setup configuration for a Python package. During installation on Windows systems, it imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted string using Fernet and executes the decrypted code with exec(). The encrypted data and key are hardcoded, suggesting potential malicious payloads that are hidden until runtime. The code appears intentionally obfuscated with unclear variable names. The use of exec() on decrypted data is highly suspicious, as it allows arbitrary code execution. The package setup includes a custom install class that performs these actions, indicating malicious intent during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains clear signs of malicious behavior: it decrypts hidden payloads and executes them dynamically during installation. This could allow remote code execution or other malicious actions on the target system. The use of encrypted payloads and exec() is characteristic of malicious package behavior. Therefore, this package is highly suspicious and should not be used.",
