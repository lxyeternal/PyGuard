{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a setup configuration for a Python package, with some embedded obfuscated or encrypted code intended for execution during installation.",
  "sources": "Import statements, embedded encrypted strings, and the exec() call within the custom install class method.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decrypted code via exec(), which can run arbitrary code if the decryption yields malicious payloads.",
  "flows": "The code decrypts a string and executes it during installation if the OS is Windows, which could lead to arbitrary code execution with installation privileges.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of encrypted payloads executed via exec() during install, obfuscated variable names, and the use of Fernet encryption within the installation process. The purpose of the decrypted code is unclear but suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up a Python package with minimal metadata. It defines a custom install class that, on Windows, imports requests and Fernet, then decrypts a string and executes it dynamically. The use of encrypted payload and exec() during package installation is suspicious, indicating possible malicious behavior or backdoor, especially since the payload's content is hidden until runtime. The rest of the code is standard package setup, but the decrypted execution constitutes a significant security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a suspicious encrypted payload executed during installation on Windows platforms. This behavior could be malicious, potentially executing arbitrary code. The rest of the package appears normal, but the dynamic execution and obfuscation raise high concern.",
