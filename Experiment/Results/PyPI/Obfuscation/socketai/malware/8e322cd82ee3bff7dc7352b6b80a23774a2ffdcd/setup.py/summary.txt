  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious behavior due to obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during setup. The tactics used are characteristic of malware, warranting a malware score of 0.9 and a security risk score of 0.9. Further decoding of the payload is recommended to confirm malicious intent, but current evidence indicates a high likelihood of malicious activity."
