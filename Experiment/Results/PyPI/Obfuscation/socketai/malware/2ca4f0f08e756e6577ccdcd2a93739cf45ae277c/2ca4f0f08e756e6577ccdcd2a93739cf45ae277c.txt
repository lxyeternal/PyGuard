      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during setup, with tactics common in malware. While the exact payload remains unknown without decoding, the obfuscation and concealment tactics justify high malware and security risk scores. Further analysis should decode the PowerShell command to confirm its purpose."
