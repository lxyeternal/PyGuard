  "sources": "No code provided; assessments based on descriptions and typical patterns.",

  "flows": "Not applicable; no code to analyze for source-to-sink flows.",
  "anomalies": "No actual code; speculative mentions of eval()/exec(), obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, but no concrete evidence.",
  "analysis": "All reports lack code snippets, limiting definitive conclusions. They correctly assign low malware and obfuscation scores given the absence of suspicious patterns. Report 4 discusses potential risks like eval()/exec() and obfuscation, which are valid concerns but without code, these remain speculative. Slight adjustments are recommended: increase malware score in Report 2 from 0 to 0.1 to reflect suspicion; lower obfuscation and risk scores in Report 4 from 0.4 to 0.2, aligning with the lack of concrete evidence. Confidence scores are appropriate, reflecting the limited information. Overall, the assessments are consistent with the available data.",
  "conclusion": "Given the absence of actual code snippets, the current low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate. Minor adjustments to Report 2's malware score and Report 4's obfuscation and risk scores improve alignment with the speculative concerns raised. The overall security posture remains low risk, with scores reflecting cautious suspicion where applicable.",
