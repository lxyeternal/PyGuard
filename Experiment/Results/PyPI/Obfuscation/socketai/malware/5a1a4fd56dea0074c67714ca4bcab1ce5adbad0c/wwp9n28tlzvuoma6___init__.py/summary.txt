  "conclusion": "Given the absence of actual code snippets, the current low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate. Minor adjustments to Report 2's malware score and Report 4's obfuscation and risk scores improve alignment with the speculative concerns raised. The overall security posture remains low risk, with scores reflecting cautious suspicion where applicable."
