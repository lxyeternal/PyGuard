  "purpose": "Minimal Python code importing all from a local module and assigning a static float to an obfuscated variable.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .test module; variable assignment to an obfuscated variable name.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, no data leaks, no network or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code executes simple import and assignment with no further processing.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import; obfuscated variable name; no comments or documentation; minimal code structure.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a wildcard import from a local module and assigns a float to an obfuscated variable name. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious operations are present. The wildcard import can be risky in larger contexts but is not inherently malicious here. The obfuscated variable name raises suspicion but does not indicate malicious intent. Scores assigned in reports (malware=0, low security risk, moderate obfuscation) are consistent with the code's benign nature. The absence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or external communication supports a benign assessment. Obfuscation and wildcard import are potential concerns but are common in benign code and do not constitute malicious activity in isolation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. Obfuscation and wildcard import are noted but do not imply malicious intent. The scores in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
