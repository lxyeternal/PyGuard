{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'pmku15dluwppr2l8' that specifies dependencies and package configuration.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package name, version, and dependencies from the setup() function parameters.",
  "targets": "The dependencies 'httpx' and 'httpx-socks' could potentially be used to perform network requests, but these are standard libraries.",
  "flows": "The package configuration does not include any code execution or data flow beyond installing dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "The package name appears to be a random string, which is unusual but not inherently malicious; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal setup script using setuptools to configure a Python package. It specifies dependencies but contains no code that reads external input, executes arbitrary code, or performs any suspicious actions. The dependency list includes common libraries for HTTP requests and proxy support. The package name does not reveal malicious intent or obfuscation. No anomalies, no hidden behaviors identified.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be legitimate and standard for package distribution. No evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks is detected based on this code snippet.",
