  "purpose": "Define a Python package with dependencies 'httpx' and 'httpx-socks' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The setup() function parameters, including package name, version, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present; the code is a static configuration.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the code only declares package metadata without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The package name 'pmku15dluwppr2l8' appears as a random or obfuscated string, which is unusual and suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal setup script with no active code, network activity, or data handling. The only anomaly is the obfuscated package name, which could be used to hide malicious intent but is not inherently malicious. The dependencies are standard and do not indicate malicious behavior. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code, with the primary concern being the suspicious package name. Malware score remains at 0, reflecting no malicious code. The obfuscated score is high (~0.8) due to the package name, and the security risk is low (~0.2), mainly due to obfuscation. Confidence in these conclusions is high, given the straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup configuration with an obfuscated package name. No active malicious behavior or code is present. The primary concern is the obfuscated name, which warrants caution in supply chain contexts, but the code itself is safe.",
