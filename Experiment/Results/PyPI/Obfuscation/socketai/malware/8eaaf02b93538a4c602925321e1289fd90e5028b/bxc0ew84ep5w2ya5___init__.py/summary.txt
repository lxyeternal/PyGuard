  "malware_score": 0.9,
  "security_risk": 0.85,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code is suspicious due to its obfuscation and use of marshaled bytecode executed via exec(). The lack of detailed analysis in the reports and the common malicious pattern suggest high risk. The payload should be decompiled and analyzed further before use. Scores should reflect high suspicion: malware score around 0.9, obfuscated score around 0.9, and risk score around 0.85."
