  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential, employing obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and environment manipulation during package installation. The suspicious techniques justify high malware and security risk scores. Further analysis of the marshaled payload is recommended, but current evidence indicates malicious behavior."
