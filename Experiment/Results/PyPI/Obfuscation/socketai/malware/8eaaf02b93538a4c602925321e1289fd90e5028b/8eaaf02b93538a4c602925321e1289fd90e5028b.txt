      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential, employing obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and environment manipulation during package installation. The suspicious techniques justify high malware and security risk scores. Further analysis of the marshaled payload is recommended, but current evidence indicates malicious behavior."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is suspicious due to its obfuscation and use of marshaled bytecode executed via exec(). The lack of detailed analysis in the reports and the common malicious pattern suggest high risk. The payload should be decompiled and analyzed further before use. Scores should reflect high suspicion: malware score around 0.9, obfuscated score around 0.9, and risk score around 0.85."
