  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package with embedded malicious activity",
  "sources": "Reading the file system (os.path.exists), executing subprocess commands (subprocess.Popen), and reading the code file itself",
  "sinks": "subprocess.Popen executing encoded PowerShell command, setup configuration that might be used maliciously",
  "flows": "os.path.exists check triggers subprocess.Popen to run hidden PowerShell command, which executes encoded script content",
  "anomalies": "Use of PowerShell with encoded command that, when decoded, executes remote or malicious code; no visible legitimate reason for such behavior; setup process is standard but overshadowed by malicious subprocess call",
  "analysis": "The script attempts to check for a directory 'tahg' and then runs a PowerShell encoded command via subprocess.Popen with hidden window flags. The encoded command is base64-encoded PowerShell script that, when decoded, appears to perform network or remote operations, possibly downloading or executing further malicious code. The setup() call appears standard but could be used to package malicious code or establish backdoors. The try-except blocks suppress errors, hiding potential issues. Overall, the code contains suspicious activity that looks like an attempt to execute hidden or malicious commands during package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior: it executes an encoded PowerShell command silently during setup, likely for malicious purposes. The presence of such code indicates an active security threat. The setup configuration itself is standard but overshadowed by the embedded malicious payload.",
