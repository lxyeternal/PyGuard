  "conclusion": "The code contains a high likelihood of malicious behavior due to the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during package setup. This activity poses a significant security risk, potentially allowing remote code execution or backdoor installation. The suspicious obfuscation and silent operation justify high malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores."
