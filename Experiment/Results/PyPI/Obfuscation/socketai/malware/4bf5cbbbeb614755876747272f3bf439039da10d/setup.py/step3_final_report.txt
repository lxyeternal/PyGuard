  "purpose": "The code checks for the existence of a directory 'tahg' and, if absent, executes a hidden, base64-encoded PowerShell command, then proceeds with package setup.",
  "sources": "Filesystem check for 'tahg'; subprocess call executing encoded PowerShell command",
  "sinks": "PowerShell process execution with hidden window, executing obfuscated code",
  "flows": "Filesystem check -> conditional execution of subprocess with encoded command -> package setup",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated base64-encoded PowerShell command executed silently during setup; suppression of errors with try-except blocks",
  "analysis": "The code performs a filesystem check and, if the directory 'tahg' does not exist, runs a subprocess executing a base64-encoded PowerShell command with hidden window style, likely obfuscated to conceal malicious intent. The command is executed silently, with error suppression, during the package installation process. The use of obfuscation, silent execution, and embedding malicious payloads during setup strongly suggests malicious or backdoor activity. The package setup itself appears legitimate but is combined with suspicious activity. The high suspicion is supported by the encoded command, which could be used for remote code execution, payload download, or system compromise. The overall pattern aligns with supply chain attack tactics.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a high likelihood of malicious behavior due to the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during package setup. This activity poses a significant security risk, potentially allowing remote code execution or backdoor installation. The suspicious obfuscation and silent operation justify high malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores.",
