      "conclusion": "The setup script contains an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command executed during installation, indicating high suspicion of malicious activity. The techniques used are consistent with malware tactics, warranting a high malware score (~0.8), obfuscation (~0.9), and security risk (~0.85). The code's behavior should be treated as potentially malicious, and further static or dynamic analysis of the decoded payload is recommended."
