  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script intended for data processing or utility functions, but the specific purpose cannot be determined from the provided fragment.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the 'sys.stdin' and 'os.environ' environment variables.",
  "sinks": "The code writes output to 'sys.stdout' and possibly executes commands via 'subprocess'.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables and stdin inputs through processing functions to outputs or system commands executed via subprocess.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials or secrets. No obfuscated code or uncommon language features detected. Usage of 'subprocess' could be suspicious if used improperly, but context is needed.",
  "analysis": "The code reads inputs from standard input and environment variables, processes data with functions that appear to be standard, and then outputs results. The use of 'subprocess' suggests system interaction, which could be benign or malicious depending on command parameters. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic observed. Absence of malicious network activity or system damage code is noted, but further context could clarify intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code fragment, there are no clear signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a standard utility script, but use of 'subprocess' warrants careful review in the full context to rule out potential command injection.",
