  "sources": "Static code import of setuptools, package metadata parameters, and dependencies list.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows; static configuration without external input or code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual package name 'ue67oj10mr7qdms4' appears as a random string, which is suspicious but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script using setuptools with static parameters. The only anomaly is the package name, which is non-descriptive and appears obfuscated. No malicious code, dynamic behavior, or external communication is present. The dependency 'requests' is benign. The package name suspicion does not translate into malicious activity based solely on this static snippet. Malware scores are appropriately zero; obfuscation suspicion is minor (0.2); overall security risk is very low (~0.2). The confidence in this assessment is high (0.8-0.9).",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, representing a standard setup script with an obfuscated package name. No evidence of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities is present. The suspicion regarding the package name is noted but does not indicate malicious intent based on this static analysis.",
