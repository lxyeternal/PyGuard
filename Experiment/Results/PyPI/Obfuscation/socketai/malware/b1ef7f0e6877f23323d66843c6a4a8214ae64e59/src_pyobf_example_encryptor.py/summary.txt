  "conclusion": "The code exhibits multiple malicious behaviors, including payload encryption, remote script fetching, dynamic execution, and persistence mechanisms. It is highly likely to be malicious malware designed for covert control and stealth operations. The scores assigned in the reports—malware: 0.9, obfuscated: 0.8, securityRisk: 0.9—are justified and consistent with these behaviors."
