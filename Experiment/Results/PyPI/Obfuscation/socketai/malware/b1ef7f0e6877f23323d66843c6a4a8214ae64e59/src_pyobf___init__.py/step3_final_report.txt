  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Code reading input data, environment variables, network connections, file operations, user inputs.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission, file writing, environment variable access, database queries, system commands.",
  "flows": "Sources such as user input or environment variables to sinks like network or file operations, potentially leading to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code; no suspicious hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected; detailed benign web server code described.",
  "analysis": "All reports without code correctly assign zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and risk, with confidence 0. Appropriate. The detailed web server code analysis (Report 4) shows standard practices, no malicious indicators, and justifies a low security risk (0.2) with high confidence (0.9). Slight overestimation of risk in some reports (e.g., 0.3) given no evidence; recommend lowering to 0.1 for conservative estimates. Overall, assessments are consistent and cautious, with no suspicious activity detected.",
  "conclusion": "The reports are consistent with their findings; no malicious or obfuscated code identified. Scores are appropriate, with minor adjustment recommended for Report 2's security risk score. Overall, the dependency appears benign, and no further action is necessary.",
