The moderate security risk score (0.2–0.3) accounts for subprocess and complexity concerns but does not indicate malicious intent. The overall assessment supports a safe status with ongoing monitoring of subprocess commands if dynamically constructed."

It is highly likely to be malicious malware designed for covert control and stealth operations. The scores assigned in the reports—malware: 0.9, obfuscated: 0.8, securityRisk: 0.9—are justified and consistent with these behaviors."
