{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that includes conditional execution of code during installation on Windows systems, potentially executing decrypted code.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (os.name), importing modules (requests, fernet), reading hardcoded encrypted data for decryption.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing decrypted code, possibly leading to arbitrary code execution.",
  "flows": "os.name check -> import requests & Fernet -> decrypt and execute code via exec() -> installation process.",
  "anomalies": "Use of encrypted data and exec() during installation; decryption of code with Fernet and execution within install method on Windows; obfuscated variable names; hardcoded encrypted payload.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a setup configuration for a package. It includes a custom install class that, when run on Windows, imports requests and Fernet modules, then decrypts and executes a code block via exec(). The encrypted payload is hardcoded, and its purpose is unclear, but executing decrypted code at install time on Windows is highly suspicious. This pattern is indicative of potential malicious activity, such as executing arbitrary code during package installation, which could be used for malicious purposes. The rest of the setup script appears standard, but the presence of decrypted code execution is a strong red flag.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains suspicious behavior, notably decrypting and executing code during installation on Windows, which could be malicious. This behavior indicates potential malicious intent or backdoor activity embedded in the package.",
