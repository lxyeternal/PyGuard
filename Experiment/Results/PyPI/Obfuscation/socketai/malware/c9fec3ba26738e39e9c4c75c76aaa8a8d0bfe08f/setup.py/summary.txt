  "malware_score": 0.9,
  "security_risk": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by decrypting and executing an obfuscated payload during installation on Windows. The encrypted payload and use of exec() strongly suggest malicious intent. The high scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the observed behavior."
