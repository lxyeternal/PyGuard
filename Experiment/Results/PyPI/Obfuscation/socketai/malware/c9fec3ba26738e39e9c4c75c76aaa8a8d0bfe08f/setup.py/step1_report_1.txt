{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, primarily used for installation.",
  "sources": "Reading of environment variables (os.name), import statements, and potentially malicious code execution within the class method.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing decrypted code, potentially executing malicious payloads; imported modules requesting network access.",
  "flows": "os.name check triggers requests and Fernet decryption, then execution of decrypted code via exec().",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variable names, encrypted payload with Fernet, and execution of code via exec() with decrypted content. Hardcoded decryption key and encrypted payload are suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a package setup with a custom install class. Inside the class, a method checks if the OS is Windows. If so, it imports requests and Fernet, then decrypts a payload and executes it with exec(). The payload is encrypted with a hardcoded Fernet key, indicating obfuscation. The use of exec() with decrypted code suggests malicious intent, potentially executing arbitrary code during installation. The presence of encrypted payload and code execution flow strongly indicates malicious behavior, such as installing backdoors or malware during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, encrypted payload that is decrypted and executed during installation on Windows systems, which is highly suspicious and indicative of malicious behavior. This package likely includes malware or a backdoor that runs malicious code during setup.",
