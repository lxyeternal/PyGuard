{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package, including a custom installation command that executes encrypted code during installation on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "Encrypted data in Fernet decrypt method, imported modules (requests, Fernet), environment variable checks",
  "sinks": "Execution of decrypted code, import statements, potential network requests via requests module",
  "flows": "During installation on Windows, the code decrypts data and executes it, possibly executing malicious payloads obtained from the decrypted content",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded encrypted string for Fernet decryption, execution of decrypted code without validation, obfuscation through nonsensical variable names, encrypted payload execution on install, presence of suspicious modules",
  "analysis": "The code uses obscure variable names and encrypts code with Fernet, decrypting and executing it during installation on Windows systems. The encrypted string is static and hardcoded, which is suspicious. The decrypted content is executed directly with exec(), a significant security risk. The presence of network modules and environment checks suggests possible malicious activity, such as executing hidden payloads or malicious code at install time. The setup configuration appears standard, but the embedded code execution is highly suspicious and could be used for malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains malicious behavior, executing encrypted code during installation, likely for malicious purposes such as installing backdoors, malware, or malicious payloads. The use of encrypted payloads and dynamic execution is a common tactic to hide malicious intent. Overall, this package should not be used.",
