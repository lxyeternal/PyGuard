{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be a setup configuration for a Python package, but it includes malicious code designed to download and execute an external executable file.",
  "sources": "Input sources include the __file__ variable to read README.md, getpass.getuser() for username, and time.time() for timestamp. The primary malicious source is the 'requests.get' call inside the function IJZXxiVpwpFtRxYGXJlGHQvtFcMLXtuv().",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows into 'open('exo.exe', 'wb').write()' to save the downloaded file, and os.system() executes the downloaded file.",
  "flows": "The function IJZXxiVpwpFtRxYGXJlGHQvtFcMLXtuv() is invoked during the custom install and develop commands, downloading an external executable and executing it, which can lead to remote code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function names and variable names, use of requests to fetch an executable from a suspicious URL, and execution of the downloaded file via 'os.system' indicate malicious intent. The code runs a potentially malicious payload during package installation.",
  "analysis": "The code is part of a setup script with typical structure but contains embedded malicious behavior. The function IJZXxiVpwpFtRxYGXJlGHQvtFcMLXtuv() fetches an executable from a suspicious URL and runs it, which is highly suspicious. The code is invoked during package installation or development setup, meaning it executes automatically without user consent. The obfuscated naming and hardcoded URL are typical malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains clear malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external executable during package setup, which can compromise systems. The suspicious URL, obfuscated function names, and execution of downloaded payload strongly suggest malicious intent.",
