      "conclusion": "The script exhibits a high likelihood of malicious activity due to execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell payload during package setup. The obfuscation, stealth execution, and error suppression are typical of malicious tactics. While the exact payload is unknown without decoding, the indicators strongly suggest malicious intent. The high scores across malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriate and justified."
