      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious intent due to obfuscated, silent PowerShell execution triggered conditionally. The scores across reports are consistent with this assessment. The package poses a high security risk and should be scrutinized further, especially by decoding the encoded command to verify its purpose."
