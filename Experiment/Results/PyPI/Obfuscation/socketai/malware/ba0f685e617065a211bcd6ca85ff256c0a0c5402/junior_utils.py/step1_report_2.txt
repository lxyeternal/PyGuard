  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a specific task or functionality within a larger Python project, possibly involving data processing or network communication. The exact purpose cannot be definitively determined from the provided snippet alone.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input functions, environment variables, or external modules, and may include data fetched from network requests or files.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network transmission points, file write operations, or system commands that could leak data or execute arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as input functions, environment variables, or network responses to sinks like output functions, network requests, or file operations, with intermediate processing steps.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual aspects include dynamic code execution, obscure variable names, hard-coded secrets, or redundant/inefficient code constructs. No obvious obfuscation or encrypted payloads are detected.",
  "analysis": "A detailed step-by-step analysis shows that the code uses standard library functions with typical control flow. No malicious patterns such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or unauthorized system access are evident. Usage of third-party libraries seems normal, and no suspicious network activity is triggered directly from the code. The code does not contain hardcoded credentials or intentionally malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not exhibit signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be legitimate, with no indicators of malware or security vulnerabilities within the analyzed snippet.",
