  "purpose": "The code appears to be a utility script intended for data processing or system operations, but the exact purpose cannot be determined definitively without further context.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, imports standard libraries, and possibly reads external files or user input (if present in the complete code).",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes to files, network sockets, or executes system commands based on imported modules, but specifics are unclear due to incomplete code.",
  "flows": "Unclear without complete code; may involve reading input from environment or user, processing data, and then outputting or transmitting results.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious function calls are visible in the provided snippet. Lack of complete code limits full assessment.",
  "analysis": "The provided code fragment is empty or incomplete, lacking substantive content for analysis. No suspicious imports, data flows, or anomalies are apparent. Without additional code, it's not possible to identify malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the incomplete snippet, there are no detectable malicious indicators. However, the absence of code prevents a thorough assessment. If more code is provided, a detailed review should be conducted.",
