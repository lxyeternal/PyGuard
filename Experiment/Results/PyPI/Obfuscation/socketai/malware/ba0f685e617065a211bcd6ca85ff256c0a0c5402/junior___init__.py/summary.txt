  "conclusion": "Report 2 shows moderate suspicion due to obfuscation and dynamic code patterns, warranting a malware score of 0.4 and a security risk of 0.6. The other reports are benign with scores of zero or very low. The current scoring is appropriate and reflects the analysis accurately. No adjustments are necessary unless further code or behavioral evidence emerges."
