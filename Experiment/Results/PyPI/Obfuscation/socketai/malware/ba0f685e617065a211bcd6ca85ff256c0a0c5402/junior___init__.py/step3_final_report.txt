  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Potential network communication, environment variables, dynamic code execution, hardcoded addresses/credentials.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission, file writes, dynamic eval/exec, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or network inputs to sinks like network transmission or file writes, possibly via eval/exec or dynamic code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variable names, use of eval/exec, hardcoded IPs/URLs, dynamic code patterns, obfuscation techniques.",
  "analysis": "The code in Report 2 exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, with hardcoded network addresses, which are typical indicators of suspicious or potentially malicious activity. The scores assigned (malware=0.4, obfuscated=0.6, securityRisk=0.6) reflect a moderate suspicion level, justified by the patterns observed. The other reports are standard setup or utility scripts with no suspicious activity, correctly scored as benign (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or low). The analysis indicates that while no definitive malicious actions are confirmed, the patterns warrant cautious scoring, especially for Report 2. The scores are consistent with the evidence and typical indicators of obfuscation and dynamic behavior, but they do not confirm malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Report 2 shows moderate suspicion due to obfuscation and dynamic code patterns, warranting a malware score of 0.4 and a security risk of 0.6. The other reports are benign with scores of zero or very low. The current scoring is appropriate and reflects the analysis accurately. No adjustments are necessary unless further code or behavioral evidence emerges.",
