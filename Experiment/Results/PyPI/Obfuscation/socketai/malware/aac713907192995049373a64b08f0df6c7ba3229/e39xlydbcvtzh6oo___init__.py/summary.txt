  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with appropriate low scores. However, the obfuscation and dynamic execution signals in Report 3 suggest a moderate red flag, justifying an increase in malware score from 0.1 to 0.3 and obfuscated score from 0.3 to 0.4. This adjustment better reflects potential malicious concealment techniques without overestimating risk. The overall assessment remains cautious but justified, emphasizing the importance of further investigation if such techniques are detected."
