{
  "purpose": "The code appears to initialize a web application, possibly for handling user requests and responses.",
  "sources": "Input from environment variables, user input via request parameters, or external APIs (not explicitly shown but implied in typical web app workflows).",
  "sinks": "Potential output to response objects, database queries, or network connections, though none are explicitly detailed in the code snippet.",
  "flows": "Data may flow from environment or user inputs into processing functions, with outputs directed towards responses or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscation, or unusual code constructs observed. The code structure appears standard for a web app.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a web application framework, sets up request handling, and may process inputs to generate responses. There is no evidence of malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful payloads. Usage of standard libraries and straightforward logic suggests normal operation. No obfuscation or malicious behavior patterns detected. The code does not contain suspicious network activity, hidden functionalities, or credential theft mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical web application setup without any signs of malicious behavior or supply chain compromise. It does not perform any suspicious actions or contain malicious payloads based on the provided snippet.",
