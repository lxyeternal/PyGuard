  "conclusion": "The script exhibits signs of malicious intent, heavy obfuscation, and system manipulation capabilities. It is likely part of a supply chain attack or backdoor payload designed to compromise the host system. The high obfuscation and system-level interactions justify a maximum malware score and high security risk. It should be considered malicious and avoided in any deployment."
