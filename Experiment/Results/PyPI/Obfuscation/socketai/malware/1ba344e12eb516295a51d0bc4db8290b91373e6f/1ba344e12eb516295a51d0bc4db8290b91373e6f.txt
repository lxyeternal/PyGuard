      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation, decoding, and dynamic execution of embedded scripts, strongly indicating malicious intent. It likely functions as a loader or backdoor, executing covert payloads in system directories, which poses a significant security threat."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign and does not exhibit malicious behavior or vulnerabilities. The reports lack detailed information and do not provide evidence to support any security concerns. Therefore, the malware score is 0, obfuscated score is low (around 0.4) due to obfuscated names, and overall security risk is minimal (around 0.1). No further action is necessary based on the provided data."

      "obfuscated": 0.75,
      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code is primarily a network connection utility with significant obfuscation that could be exploited for malicious purposes, such as covert communication or command and control. However, no active malware or payloads are present. The suspicion stems from obfuscation and network capabilities, but the code appears benign in its current form. The security risk is moderate, and malware likelihood is low but non-negligible due to potential misuse."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits significant obfuscation and flexible proxy handling, which could be exploited for malicious purposes such as covert communication or data exfiltration. While no direct malicious activity is evident, the structure warrants caution. The scores should reflect moderate suspicion, with malware around 0.4, obfuscation high (~0.8), and overall security risk moderate (~0.65)."

      "obfuscated": 0.75,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate SOCKS proxy client with obfuscated naming conventions. No evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or sabotage is detected. The high obfuscation scores are justified, and the malware score remains at 0. The overall security risk is low, but caution should be exercised in untrusted environments due to obfuscation."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting of obfuscated exception class definitions with no logic or malicious activity. Obfuscation alone warrants caution but does not confirm malicious intent. The scores across reports are appropriate, with low malware and risk scores reflecting the lack of active malicious behavior."
