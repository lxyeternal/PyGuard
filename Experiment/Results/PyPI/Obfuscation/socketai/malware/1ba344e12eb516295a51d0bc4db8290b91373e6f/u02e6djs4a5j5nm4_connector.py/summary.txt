  "conclusion": "The code exhibits significant obfuscation and flexible proxy handling, which could be exploited for malicious purposes such as covert communication or data exfiltration. While no direct malicious activity is evident, the structure warrants caution. The scores should reflect moderate suspicion, with malware around 0.4, obfuscation high (~0.8), and overall security risk moderate (~0.65)."
