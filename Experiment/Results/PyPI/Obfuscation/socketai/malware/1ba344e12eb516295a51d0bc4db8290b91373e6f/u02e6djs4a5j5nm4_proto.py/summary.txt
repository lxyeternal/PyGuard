  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate SOCKS proxy client with obfuscated naming conventions. No evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or sabotage is detected. The high obfuscation scores are justified, and the malware score remains at 0. The overall security risk is low, but caution should be exercised in untrusted environments due to obfuscation."
