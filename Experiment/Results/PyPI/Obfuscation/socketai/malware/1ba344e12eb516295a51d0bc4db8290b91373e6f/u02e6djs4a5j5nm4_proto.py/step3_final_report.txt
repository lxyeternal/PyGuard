{
  "purpose": "The code implements a SOCKS proxy client supporting SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols, including connection handling, address resolution, and optional authentication.",
  "sources": "Network address inputs, credentials, request data, environment-dependent modules.",
  "sinks": "Socket send and receive functions, DNS resolution, address translation.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow through address resolution, socket connection, and data transfer functions, with data sent via socket operations during handshake and data relay.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated variable and class names, dynamic import checks for environment detection, complex control flow, no hardcoded credentials, no suspicious domain or payload indicators.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a SOCKS proxy client supporting both SOCKS4 and SOCKS5, with detailed connection, authentication, and address resolution procedures. Obfuscation is present through variable names and class identifiers, likely to conceal complexity or proprietary logic. No signs of malicious payloads, data exfiltration, or sabotage are evident. The code's behavior aligns with legitimate proxy client implementations, and the absence of hardcoded secrets or suspicious network activity supports this. The obfuscation, while high, does not necessarily indicate malicious intent but warrants caution if sourced from untrusted origins.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate SOCKS proxy client with obfuscated naming conventions. No evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or sabotage is detected. The high obfuscation scores are justified, and the malware score remains at 0. The overall security risk is low, but caution should be exercised in untrusted environments due to obfuscation.",
