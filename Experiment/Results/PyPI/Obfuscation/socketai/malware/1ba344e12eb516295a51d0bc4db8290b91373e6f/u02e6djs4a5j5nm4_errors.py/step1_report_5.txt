{
  "purpose": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes, possibly for use in a larger application or framework.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading points are present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data could be mishandled or leaked are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows, input-output flows, or source-to-sink pathways in this code.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of class definitions with obscure class names, which may suggest obfuscation or malicious concealment. No functional behavior, data handling, or I/O is present that would indicate malicious activity. The class names appear intentionally obfuscated, but that alone does not imply malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes, some inheriting from built-in exceptions such as Exception and OSError. The class names are highly obfuscated, which can be a sign of trying to hide purpose or simply obfuscation. No data is read or written, no network or system calls, and no logic is present beyond class definitions. There are no suspicious behaviors like data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious control flows. The purpose appears to be creating custom exception types, with obfuscated class names potentially to hide their purpose or for obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign set of custom exception class definitions with obfuscated class names. There is no malicious behavior or security risk detected. The obfuscation is likely superficial or intended to conceal purpose, but it does not imply malicious activity.",
