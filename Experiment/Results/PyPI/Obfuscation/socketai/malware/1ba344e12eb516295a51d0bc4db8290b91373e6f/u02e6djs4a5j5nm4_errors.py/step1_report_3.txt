{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes, likely for specific error handling within a larger application or package.",
  "sources": "Class definitions; no input reading or external data sources identified.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks such as data transmission, file writing, or system commands.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; classes are only declarations without methods or data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "All classes are simple subclasses of exceptions with no additional logic, attributes, or code. Class names appear obfuscated or randomly generated, which is unusual and can be suspicious. The code contains no functional logic, only class declarations.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class declarations, mostly subclasses of Exception and OSError, with obfuscated or nonsensical class names. There is no implementation, data handling, or logic that could indicate malicious activity. The naming pattern suggests possible obfuscation or intentional concealment, which warrants further review in context, but on its own, this appears to be harmless structure setup. No hardcoded credentials, network calls, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of obfuscated class definitions for exceptions with no operational code or malicious behavior. While the obfuscated class names could raise suspicion, their implementation does not indicate malware or security risks on its own.",
