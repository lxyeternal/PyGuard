  "purpose": "Obfuscated exception class definitions with no logic or external interactions.",
  "sources": "Class declarations, class inheritance from Exception, OSError, or custom exceptions.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data flow, input, output, or external data handling.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; classes are standalone definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class names, lack of methods or logic, potential intent to conceal malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of multiple class definitions with obfuscated names inheriting from exception classes, with no methods, attributes, or external interactions. The obfuscation could be used to hide malicious intent, but no active malicious behavior, data leaks, or external communications are evident. The high obfuscation scores are justified, but the absence of logic or data flow suggests benign intent. The malware scores in the reports vary, with some indicating suspicion due to obfuscation, but no concrete evidence of malicious activity is present. Overall, the code appears to be obfuscated exception class definitions with no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting of obfuscated exception class definitions with no logic or malicious activity. Obfuscation alone warrants caution but does not confirm malicious intent. The scores across reports are appropriate, with low malware and risk scores reflecting the lack of active malicious behavior.",
