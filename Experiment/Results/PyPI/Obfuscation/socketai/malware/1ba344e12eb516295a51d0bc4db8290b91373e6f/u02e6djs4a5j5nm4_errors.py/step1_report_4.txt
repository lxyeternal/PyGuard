{
  "purpose": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes, likely intended for specialized error handling within a larger application.",
  "sources": "Class definitions for exception types, no external input reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks identified in this code fragment.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks as there are only class declarations with no methods or data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "The class names are obfuscated with random strings, which could indicate an attempt to conceal intent. No actual malicious code, payload, or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains class declarations for custom exceptions, including inheritance from built-in exceptions and OSError. No input reading, data processing, or network activity is present. The obfuscated class names are unusual but not inherently malicious. The absence of code logic or data manipulation reduces the likelihood of malicious behavior. No backdoors, hidden behaviors, or malicious payloads are visible.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a set of obfuscated exception class definitions, with no indication of malicious intent or security risk. The obfuscation could be for code concealment or stylistic reasons, but it does not suggest malicious activity based on this fragment alone.",
