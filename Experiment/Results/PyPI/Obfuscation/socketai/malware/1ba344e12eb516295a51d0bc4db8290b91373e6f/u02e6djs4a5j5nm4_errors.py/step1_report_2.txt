  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes, some of which inherit from built-in exceptions",
  "sources": "Class definitions and inheritance declarations",
  "sinks": "No evident untrusted data handling or external effects",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; primarily class inheritance structure",
  "anomalies": "All class names are obfuscated, but they are only custom exception classes without any embedded code or logic",
  "analysis": "The code creates multiple custom exception classes with obfuscated names, inheriting from standard exceptions. No functions, methods, or executable logic are present. The classes do not perform any actions, nor do they handle input or data. The obfuscated naming pattern appears intentional to hide their purpose but does not indicate malicious code or behavior. No code injection, data leakage, or external network activity is evident. The structure is consistent with exception class definitions, possibly to be used elsewhere.",
  "conclusion": "The code is solely defining obfuscated exception classes without any malicious logic or behavior. It appears to be intentionally obfuscated but harmless based on the provided snippet.",
