{
  "purpose": "Define multiple custom exception classes, mostly inheriting from a base exception class, with no additional functionality or logic.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and inheritance declarations, no external input, environment variables, or data handling observed.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no data flows or external interactions present in the code.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow pathways identified due to lack of data handling or external I/O.",
  "anomalies": "All classes are simply empty subclasses with obfuscated names, potentially used to hide malicious intent or to confuse code analysis. No actual logic or behavior is implemented.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class declarations with highly obfuscated names, inheriting from standard exception classes or built-in exceptions, but with no methods or attributes. The lack of any functional code, combined with obfuscated class names, suggests an attempt to hide malicious intent or create a confusing structure. The code does not perform any operations, data handling, or network activity. Its purpose could be to serve as a placeholder for malicious code or to mislead code reviewers. Given the obfuscation and lack of legitimate functionality, there is a significant concern about malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears intentionally obfuscated, with no legitimate functionality provided. Its structure suggests it may be used to hide malicious behavior or serve as a distraction. There are no external data sources, sinks, or data flows, but the obfuscated class names and lack of logic raise suspicion of malicious intent.",
