  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform data processing or manipulation, potentially involving network or system operations.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from environment variables, function parameters, or imported modules; possibly reads files or network responses.",
  "sinks": "Uses subprocess calls, network connections, file writes, or sensitive environment variables, which could lead to data exfiltration or system modification.",
  "flows": "Input data from sources flows into processing functions, possibly reaching system calls, network operations, or file system modifications.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials or malicious obfuscation detected. Some dynamic code execution features are present but appear standard. No suspicious domain or IP hardcoded. Slightly unusual imports or usage patterns do not necessarily imply malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with imports and environment variable accesses, which are typical for configuration. It contains functions that invoke subprocesses, handle network connections, or manipulate files. No signs of malicious payloads such as data exfiltration, cryptomining, or backdoors are evident. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are present. The code structure and usage appear consistent with legitimate utility scripts. However, without full context of all external modules or runtime environment, absolute certainty is limited.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no clear evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The code seems to perform standard operations that could be part of legitimate functionality. No security risks or anomalies indicating supply chain threats are identified.",
