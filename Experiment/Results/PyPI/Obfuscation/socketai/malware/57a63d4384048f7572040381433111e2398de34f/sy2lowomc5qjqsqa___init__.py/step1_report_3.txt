  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be designed for some form of data processing or utility functions within a Python package.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from environment variables, function inputs, and possibly external modules or APIs if used within the functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, file writes, or database operations, but specific sinks cannot be confirmed without the actual code details. No evident untrusted data handling points are explicitly shown.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or function parameters to sinks like external systems or storage, if present. The code does not demonstrate explicit flow paths in the provided snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors are evident. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious constructs are observed.",
  "analysis": "The analysis is based on the provided code snippet, which appears to be standard Python functions or modules without suspicious patterns. There are no signs of malicious code such as network data exfiltration, malicious backdoors, or data leaks. Usage of third-party libraries seems typical and not suspicious. No unusual obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are detected. The code structure appears straightforward and consistent with legitimate utility functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit signs of malware, malicious intent, or significant security risks. It appears to be legitimate, well-structured Python code with no obvious security threats.",
