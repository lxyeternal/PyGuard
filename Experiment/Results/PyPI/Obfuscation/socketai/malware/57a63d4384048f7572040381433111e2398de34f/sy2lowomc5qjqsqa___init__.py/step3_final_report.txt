  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, function inputs, modules, user inputs, parameters, files, network connections.",
  "sinks": "Network, files, subprocess calls, environment variables, printing, database (potentially).",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables and inputs flow into functions, subprocesses, network connections, or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, suspicious code, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears standard, with typical data processing and system interaction patterns. No signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation. The reasoning in the reports is consistent, noting the absence of suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious payloads. Confidence levels are high (0.8-0.9), and the malware scores are zero, aligning with the lack of evidence for malicious intent. The security risk scores are low (0.2), reflecting minimal concern given the benign analysis. No code snippets or suspicious behaviors are identified, and the assessments are justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. Overall, the dependency appears benign with minimal security concern.",
