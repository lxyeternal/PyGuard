  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility functions, but without specific context or documentation, the exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from environment variables, function parameters, and possibly external modules or network sources (if present).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include printing to console, writing to files, or network communication via HTTP requests or socket connections.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or input parameters through processing functions, potentially reaching sinks like network calls or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs are detected. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns are apparent. Usage of dynamic eval or exec is absent, and code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "A detailed review shows standard function definitions, safe handling of data, and no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system modification, or stealthy activity. No suspicious network activity or code injections detected. Code structure and formatting are typical, with no obfuscated segments or misleading variable names.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. The code appears to be a benign utility or processing script with no security risks or malware indicators.",
