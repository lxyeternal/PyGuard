  "purpose": "Obfuscated conditional logic and dynamic imports potentially for stealthy package installation or modification.",
  "sources": "Reading sys.argv[1], environment variables (via os.getenv), and file system interactions (os.path, os.makedirs, open, write, close).",
  "sinks": "Potentially executing code via imported modules (pip, os, ctypes), modifying files (write, close), creating shortcuts, and invoking system calls (win32com, Dispatch).",
  "flows": "Untrusted input from sys.argv[1], environment variables, and file contents influence control flow; certain values trigger imports, file operations, and system modifications; flow indicates possible setup or backdoor behavior.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated code with dynamic string construction, unusual variable naming (including Unicode characters), nested complex bitwise and arithmetic operations, and conditional execution based on obscure calculations. Use of third-party modules like win32com and ctypes without clear purpose. The code performs file creation, environment variable access, system calls, and folder manipulations with no clear benign purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code uses extensive obfuscation via string construction with octal, hex, and bitwise operations, making static analysis difficult. Initial conditionals depend on runtime platform checks and command-line arguments, with deep nested logic based on calculated values. The code dynamically imports modules such as pip, win32com, os, and ctypes based on specific conditions, suggesting potential for system modification, privilege escalation, or malware payload delivery. There are multiple code paths involving file operations (creating shortcuts, writing to files), environment variable access, and executing system commands. The logic suggests stealthy setup of potentially malicious components, including creating shortcuts and manipulating files, possibly for persistence or privilege escalation. The heavily obfuscated control flow and variable names (including Unicode characters) raise suspicion about malicious intent and an attempt to evade detection. Overall, the code exhibits characteristics typical of malicious or sabotage code, including potential backdoors, system modifications, and stealth techniques.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is highly obfuscated, dynamically loads potentially malicious modules, and performs system-level operations with no clear benign purpose. It appears designed to execute malicious payloads, establish persistence, or modify the system stealthily. The use of obscure calculations, Unicode variable names, and conditional logic based on runtime data strongly suggests malicious intent. Therefore, this package should be considered highly dangerous and not suitable for use.",
