      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation and malicious behavior, including system modifications, package installation, privilege checks, and file manipulations. It is designed to conceal its intent, likely to establish backdoors or sabotage the system. The high scores reflect the severity of potential threats. It should be flagged as malicious and avoided in supply chain contexts."
