  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be a standard Python script performing some data processing or utility functions. No explicit malicious intent is evident.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters, environment variables, or external files as indicated by open(), os.environ, or input() calls.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections (e.g., socket, requests), file writes, subprocess calls, or database interactions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as user input or environment variables to sinks like network, file system, or subprocesses, potentially without validation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. Unusual dynamic execution or misleading variable names are absent.",
  "analysis": "A thorough review shows standard coding practices with no signs of malicious code. The code uses common libraries without suspicious imports. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated segments are present. The control flow is straightforward, with no unusual data flows or hidden behaviors. No network connections or external data exfiltration mechanisms are evident. The code does not perform any harmful actions or contain backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign with a low malware score and security risk. Confidence in this conclusion is high.",
