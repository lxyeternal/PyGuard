  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, input functions, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), hardcoded secrets, network connections.",
  "sinks": "eval/exec calls, network sockets, file modifications, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Input sources to eval/exec or network transmission, potential data exfiltration or code execution pathways.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec without clear necessity, high obfuscation scores, inconsistent or unexplained dynamic code patterns.",
  "analysis": "Most reports correctly identify benign or suspicious features. Report 1 indicates obfuscation and dynamic execution, justifying moderate suspicion; others show straightforward code with no signs of malicious activity. Scores align with descriptions, though some suspicion in Report 1 could be slightly tempered due to lack of concrete code snippets. Overall, the assessments are consistent and justified.",
  "conclusion": "The majority of code appears benign, with Report 1 justifiably raising moderate concern based on obfuscation and dynamic execution signs. The scoring is appropriate; no major revisions needed. Continued monitoring for obfuscation and dynamic behaviors is recommended.",
