      "conclusion": "The code appears benign and follows standard setup patterns. The obfuscated package name raises suspicion but does not demonstrate malicious activity. Further review of the package contents and the 'main' function implementation is recommended before deployment. The overall security risk is low, with a malware score of 0 and an obfuscation suspicion score around 0.6."

The obfuscation further supports malicious activity. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the behavior observed."
