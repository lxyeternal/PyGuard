  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup process that includes a custom installation step which executes decrypted code on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "Code decrypts a Fernet-encrypted string during runtime, specifically when the OS is Windows.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decrypted code via exec() on Windows, which may run arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "During installation on Windows, the code decrypts a string and executes it, potentially executing malicious payloads if the encrypted data is malicious.",
  "anomalies": "Encrypted payload executed via exec() during install on Windows; presence of obfuscated variables and encrypted strings; unusual setup code with dynamic code execution; the package name and version are nonspecific and look suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package with an unusual class that overrides the install command. During installation on Windows, it decrypts a Fernet-encrypted string and executes it dynamically. This decrypt-and-execute pattern is a common technique for embedding malicious code, as it obscures the payload and only decrypts at runtime. The code uses a hardcoded Fernet key, which could be malicious if it decrypts a harmful payload. The encrypted string is not human-readable, and the use of exec() to run decrypted code poses significant security risks. The package metadata appears intentionally obfuscated and nonspecific, further raising suspicion. Overall, the code appears designed to execute hidden malicious payloads during installation, particularly on Windows.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains malicious behavior by decrypting and executing arbitrary code during installation on Windows systems. The use of encrypted payloads, dynamic execution, and obfuscated variables indicates intentional concealment of malicious activities, constituting a security threat.",
