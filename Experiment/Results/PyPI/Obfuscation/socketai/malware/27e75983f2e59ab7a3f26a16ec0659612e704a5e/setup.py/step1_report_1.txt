{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up a Python package with custom installation behavior, possibly to execute remote code during installation.",
  "sources": "The source reads are from the import statements, the Fernet decryption key and ciphertext, and the 'exec' function execution.",
  "sinks": "The 'exec' function executes decrypted code, which is a potential sink for malicious code execution.",
  "flows": "The flow involves decrypting data with Fernet, then executing it via 'exec', which could lead to malicious remote code execution during install.",
  "anomalies": "Use of encrypted code and 'exec' during installation, conditional on OS, indicates obfuscation and potential malicious intent. Hardcoded Fernet key and ciphertext are suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools and defines a custom installer class. Within the installer, if the OS is Windows, it decrypts a ciphertext with a hardcoded Fernet key and executes the resulting code dynamically. The decryption and execution are suspicious because they hide malicious code, which is only revealed at install time. The setup configuration uses nonsensical variable names and an unusual 'setup_requires' with 'fernet' (a non-standard package), further indicating obfuscation. The presence of encrypted payload and execution at install time poses a high security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated logic designed to execute decrypted code during installation, likely malicious. This behavior could enable remote code execution or other malicious activities on target systems, especially on Windows OS. The suspicious use of encryption and dynamic execution indicates malicious intent.",
