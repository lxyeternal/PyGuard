{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, with some additional logic that executes during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables, imports modules, and executes decrypted code within the install method.",
  "sinks": "The exec() function executes code that is decrypted at runtime, which could be malicious if the decrypted payload is harmful.",
  "flows": "During installation on Windows (os.name == 'nt'), the code decrypts a payload with Fernet and executes it via exec().",
  "anomalies": "The use of encrypted payloads and execution of decrypted code during installation is unusual and suspicious. Variable names are obfuscated. The code decrypts and runs potentially malicious code dynamically.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a setup configuration with hardcoded obfuscated variables and a custom install class. In the install method, if the OS is Windows, it imports requests and Fernet, decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload, and executes it dynamically. This behavior suggests code injection or execution of arbitrary code during package installation, which is a security concern. The presence of encrypted code and dynamic execution indicates malicious intent or sabotage, especially given the obfuscation and encrypted payload.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by decrypting and executing code at install time on Windows systems, likely to run hidden or malicious actions during setup. The obfuscation and encrypted payload further support suspicion of malicious intent.",
