      "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and likely malicious, executing encrypted payloads during installation on Windows. The pattern of obfuscation, hardcoded encrypted data, and dynamic execution indicates a severe security threat. The scores assigned by the reports are accurate and justified. This package should be flagged and removed from distribution channels."
