{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a highly malicious credential and data stealer, designed to extract browser passwords, cookies, tokens, wallet information, and system details, decrypt encrypted data, and exfiltrate all gathered information via webhooks and file uploads. It also terminates related processes and obfuscates its operations to evade detection.",
  "sources": "Requests to external APIs (e.g., IP address, geolocation), environment variables (e.g., LOCALAPPDATA, APPDATA, TEMP), local files (browser storage, login databases, wallet files, local state files), directories containing browser and wallet data, and user directories for system info.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to hardcoded webhooks and external servers, file writes (ZIP archives, logs, credential dumps), process termination commands (taskkill), file uploads via requests, and decryption routines that handle sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Data is collected from sources such as environment variables, local files, and directories, then decrypted using Windows APIs, and finally transmitted via network requests or uploaded files. Multiple threads run concurrently to perform data collection, decryption, and exfiltration, culminating in ZIP archives sent to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, complex threading, dynamic dependency installation, encrypted data routines, hardcoded external webhook URLs, incomplete or malformed code snippets, and extensive use of decryption routines suggest intentional obfuscation and malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits behaviors characteristic of malware: it collects sensitive user data (passwords, cookies, tokens, wallet info), decrypts encrypted data using Windows cryptography APIs, exfiltrates data via webhooks and file uploads, terminates related processes, and employs obfuscation techniques such as variable name mangling and dynamic module installation. The presence of hardcoded webhooks, decryption routines, and multi-threaded data harvesting strongly indicates malicious activity. The code's structure and routines align with known info-stealer malware, with multiple signals supporting high severity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a highly malicious, obfuscated data-stealing malware designed to exfiltrate sensitive credentials, tokens, and system information. It employs encryption, process control, and stealth techniques to evade detection and maximize data theft. The overall assessment confirms a high probability of malicious intent.",
