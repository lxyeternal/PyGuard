  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Clearly malicious — data theft, exfiltration, system control.\n- **Sources:** Requests to external APIs, environment variables, local files (browser storage, login data), system directories, and user data files.\n- **Sinks:** Network requests (webhooks, urlopen), file writes (ZIP, logs), process commands (subprocess), data exfiltration.\n- **Flows:** Data from sources into decryption routines, then to uploads; threading for concurrency.\n- **Anomalies:** Obfuscated variables, multiple webhooks, dynamic code execution, extensive data collection, encrypted data handling.\n- **Analysis:** Highly malicious, extensive data harvesting, decryption routines, exfiltration, stealth techniques.\n- **Conclusion:** Confirmed malicious, dangerous, high confidence.\n\n**Scores:** Malware: 1.0, Obfuscated: 0.7, Risk: 1.0  \n**Justification:** The behavior is clearly malicious, with active data theft, external communication, and system control. The obfuscation supports evasion but is not extreme. Overall, scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Malicious activities — exfiltration, token harvesting, info collection.\n- **Sources:** Environment variables, network requests, local files.\n- **Sinks:** Network endpoints, file operations, process termination, ZIP creation, uploads.\n- **Flows:** Data from sources to sinks, exfiltration routines, process control.\n- **Anomalies:** Obfuscated names, suspicious URL (Discord webhook), token extraction routines, threading, encryption/decryption routines.\n- **Analysis:** Strongly indicates malicious intent; data is collected and sent externally, with process control.\n- **Conclusion:** Clearly malicious, high confidence.\n\n**Scores:** Malware: 1.0, Obfuscated: 0.8, Risk: 1.0  \n**Justification:** The detailed data collection, external exfiltration, and control features justify maximum scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Malicious, designed for info theft, credential harvesting, exfiltration.\n- **Sources:** Environment variables, local files (browser storage, login data), directories.\n- **Sinks:** Network requests, file uploads, process commands, ZIP archives.\n- **Flows:** Data from local sources into decryption routines, then transmitted via network.\n- **Anomalies:** Obfuscated variable names, hardcoded webhook URL, decryption routines, process termination, threading.\n- **Analysis:** Very suspicious; extensive credential and data harvesting, encryption handling, stealth techniques.\n- **Conclusion:** Malicious, high confidence.\n\n**Scores:** Malware: 1.0, Obfuscated: 0.7, Risk: 1.0  \n**Justification:** All behaviors are consistent with malware activity, justifying maximum malware and risk scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Malicious data theft, credential harvesting, exfiltration, system control.\n- **Sources:** Environment variables, local files, directories, network requests.\n- **Sinks:** Webhooks, file uploads, process commands, encryption/decryption routines.\n- **Flows:** Data from sources to network/file exfiltration, with threading.\n- **Anomalies:** Obfuscated variables, focus on sensitive data, process termination, threading, suspicious URLs.\n- **Analysis:** Clear malicious intent; extensive data collection, decryption, exfiltration, process control.\n- **Conclusion:** Highly malicious, high confidence.\n\n**Scores:** Malware: 0.9, Obfuscated: 0.8, Risk: 0.9  \n**Justification:** Slightly less certain than previous but still clearly malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Malicious, credential and data theft, exfiltration.\n- **Sources:** Environment variables, local files, directories, network.\n- **Sinks:** Network requests, file uploads, process commands.\n- **Flows:** Data from sources into decryption routines, then to exfiltration.\n- **Anomalies:** Obfuscated variable names, external URLs, decryption routines, threading.\n- **Analysis:** Consistent with malware; active data theft and exfiltration.\n- **Conclusion:** Confirmed malicious, high confidence.\n\n**Scores:** Malware: 1.0, Obfuscated: 0.7, Risk: 1.0  \n**Justification:** Behavior matches typical credential stealer malware.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports indicate high malicious activity, with behaviors such as data exfiltration, decryption routines, process termination, and external communication. The malware score should be **close to 1.0** for all, reflecting high malicious intent.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** Variable names, encrypted data handling, dynamic module installation, and threading suggest obfuscation, but not extreme. A score around **0.7-0.8** seems appropriate.\n\n- **Risk score:** Given the active data theft, system control, and exfiltration, the risk is **serious**, warranting a score of **0.9-1.0**.\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** **1.0** (confirmed malicious activities)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0.75** (moderately obfuscated, techniques to evade detection)\n- **Risk:** **1.0** (highly dangerous, active exfiltration, system control, credential theft)\n\n**Final notes:** The reports are consistent, and the scores assigned are reasonable given the evidence. The core logic confirms malicious intent, and the technical details support maximum malware and risk scores with a moderate obfuscation level.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Estimated Value |\n|------------------|-----------------|\n| Malware          | **1.0**         |\n| Obfuscated       | **0.75**        |\n| Security Risk    | **1.0**         |\n\nThis reflects the high severity and malicious nature of the code across all reports.",
