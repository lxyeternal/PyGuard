{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for malicious activities including data theft, credential extraction, information exfiltration, and system reconnaissance. It involves stealing user data such as cookies, login information, passwords, browser histories, and other sensitive data, then exfiltrating this data to external servers via webhooks and file uploads.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, local files (e.g., login data, cookies, Local State files), web requests to geolocation and API endpoints, and file system directories containing browser and application data.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows to external webhooks, remote servers via HTTP requests, file uploads, and possibly command execution through subprocesses. Data exfiltration is primarily done via Discord webhooks and file upload services, with network requests to external APIs and servers.",
  "flows": "Data flows from local system sources (browsers, applications, local files) through parsing and decryption functions, then to remote endpoints such as Discord webhooks, Gofile upload, or other external servers. There are multiple threads handling different data sources concurrently, culminating in exfiltration commands.",
  "anomalies": "Multiple indicators of malicious intent include: use of obfuscated and encoded strings, collection of login data, cookies, and browser data, repeated download and installation of modules without verification, use of command to kill processes forcibly, dynamic creation of ZIP archives for data collection, and extensive use of threading for parallel data theft. The code also accesses sensitive directories and decrypts stored browser credentials, which is typical in malware aimed at credential theft.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by installing necessary modules silently, then gathers system IP and environment variables. It collects user data from various browsers and applications, decrypts stored passwords and cookies, and gathers sensitive files. It employs threading to expedite data collection, then zips and uploads the data to external servers (via webhooks and upload services). There are functions for extracting, decrypting, and exfiltrating credentials, cookies, and files, often through obfuscated and encoded strings. It also kills processes associated with popular browsers and applications before collecting data. The code’s structure, functions, and network activities are characteristic of malware used for credential theft, data exfiltration, and system reconnaissance. The presence of hardcoded webhook URLs, aggressive process termination, and extensive data collection strongly indicate malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, functioning as a credential stealer and data exfiltrator. It secretly gathers sensitive user information, decrypts stored credentials, and uploads the data to external servers. Its use of threading, obfuscation, and system manipulation confirms it is designed for malicious purposes, specifically for theft and espionage. High confidence due to clear data theft activities and external communications.",
