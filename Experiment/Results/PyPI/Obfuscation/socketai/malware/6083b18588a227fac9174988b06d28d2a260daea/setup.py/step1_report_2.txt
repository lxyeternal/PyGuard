{
  "purpose": "The script appears to perform malicious activities including data exfiltration, token harvesting, system information collection, and potentially malicious file operations, disguised as a setup script.",
  "sources": "Environment variables ('LOCALAPPDATA', 'APPDATA', 'TEMP'), network requests (urlopen, requests.post), file system reads (e.g., login data, Local State files), input from system directories, and user environment data.",
  "sinks": "Network endpoints (webhooks, requests.post, urlopen), file operations (reading login databases, Local State files, and directories), process termination (taskkill), zip file creation, and data upload functions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables and files to sinks such as network requests, file writes, and process termination commands. It exfiltrates login data, cookies, stored passwords, and system info to remote servers, and manipulates or terminates processes based on system findings.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, suspicious URL (Discord webhook), functions that perform token extraction, encryption/decryption functions, and multiple threading operations for data collection. The code includes functions for stealing browser data, system info, and possibly passwords, which is highly suspicious. The code structure mimics legitimate setup files but performs malicious tasks in the background.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with a typical setup import but then loads numerous modules and installs dependencies like 'requests' and 'pycryptodome' dynamically, which is common in malicious scripts to evade static detection. It contains functions to retrieve the system's public IP, geolocation, and user environment info. It accesses browser login data, cookies, and Local State files, decrypts stored passwords, and exfiltrates this data to a Discord webhook. Several functions perform file collection and zipping, process termination, and network uploads, all of which are typical in info-stealer malware. The presence of hardcoded webhook URL, encrypted data handling, and token parsing further confirms malicious intent. The code heavily relies on threading to perform concurrent data exfiltration tasks, indicating an attempt to maximize data theft efficiently.",
  "conclusion": "The script is clearly malicious, designed to harvest user credentials, cookies, tokens, and system information, and exfiltrate them to a remote server via webhook. It includes functions for decrypting stored browser data, collecting system files, and terminating processes, all typical behaviors of stealer malware. The obfuscation of variable names and obfuscated patterns suggest an attempt to evade detection. Overall, this package demonstrates high malicious intent and should be considered dangerous.",
