{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a malicious script designed to steal user data, login credentials, cookies, and sensitive information from various applications and browsers. It also exfiltrates data to external servers via webhooks and upload services, indicating a purpose of unauthorized data collection and potential malware deployment.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from environment variables, local files such as browser storage, cookies, login data, local state files, and various directories associated with browsers, wallets, and gaming applications. It also reads logs and database files (e.g., Chrome/Edge/Opera cookies and login data, wallet files, logs), as well as files from specific directories related to the user’s system and applications.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data can reach remote servers via URL requests, webhooks, and file uploads (Gofile). It also writes collected data to files and prepares payloads for external exfiltration. Notably, it uses requests to POST data, and functions for uploading tokens, credentials, and browser data. The code kills processes, manipulates ZIP archives, and executes commands, which could be used for malicious purposes.",
  "flows": "Data flows from various system and application files (sources) into in-memory variables and functions that process or decrypt sensitive information (such as cookies, passwords, tokens). The decrypted and collected data is then sent over the network via web requests and uploaded files (sinks). There are multiple threading functions orchestrating parallel data collection and exfiltration, indicating complex data flow aimed at stealthy data harvesting.",
  "anomalies": "- Multiple obfuscated or seemingly randomly named functions and variables.\n- Use of hardcoded Discord webhook URL.\n- Use of environment variables for paths, suggesting targeting of common browser and wallet directories.\n- Multiple functions to decrypt and extract stored credentials, cookies, and tokens.\n- Process termination commands for specific applications.\n- Data exfiltration via file upload and webhook.\n- Use of threading for concurrent execution.\n- Presence of code snippets for stealing cookies, login data, and wallet information.\n- The code imports numerous modules, including requests, cryptography, threading, and system-specific modules, with some imported but unused or obfuscated logic.\n- Setup function at the end attempts to package or possibly repackage code, possibly to disguise malicious intent.\n- The code contains many inconsistent or incomplete parts, likely obfuscated or intentionally misleading.\n- Presence of suspicious URL and the use of base64 decoding and decryption routines.\n",
  "analysis": "This script is highly suspicious due to its focus on extracting sensitive user data such as cookies, passwords, tokens, and wallet information from various applications and browsers. It employs multiple techniques to decrypt encrypted data (e.g., AES decryption with Windows Crypt32 API), access system directories, and process stored credentials and tokens. The use of threading to perform concurrent data collection, combined with exfiltration methods like webhooks and file uploads, indicates an intent to operate stealthily and efficiently.\nThe code’s initial parts include environment variable usage to locate user data paths, indicating targeted collection of browser and wallet data. The presence of functions for decrypting stored credentials, killing processes, and archiving data supports a malicious exfiltration pipeline.\nThe hardcoded webhook URL suggests external control or data reception by an attacker. Overall, the code is structured to harvest private information, possibly for malicious purposes like identity theft, account hijacking, or selling data.\nThe packaging setup at the end could be used to recompile or distribute the malicious code as a Python package.\nConfidence is high given the functions and data flow, and the overall purpose appears malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, primarily aimed at stealing user credentials, cookies, tokens, and sensitive application data, then exfiltrating this information to external servers. Its obfuscated variables, process termination commands, and extensive data extraction routines confirm its intent to operate as malware. It should be considered highly dangerous and should not be executed.",
