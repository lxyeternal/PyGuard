{
  "purpose": "The script appears to set up a Python package with metadata, but includes an embedded PowerShell command intended to run silently.",
  "sources": "The code reads the filesystem (checking for 'tahg'), and executes a subprocess with a PowerShell command encoded in Base64.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess call executes an encoded PowerShell command which could be used for malicious activity, such as downloading or executing remote code.",
  "flows": "Filesystem check -> Conditional execution of subprocess with PowerShell command.",
  "anomalies": "The PowerShell command is Base64-encoded, suggesting obfuscation. The command runs silently with hidden window, which is suspicious. The command string is long and encoded, typical of hidden or malicious scripts. The setup call is wrapped in try-except with a silent pass, hiding errors.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with importing setup from distutils and attempts to import subprocess and os modules. It checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists; if not, it runs a subprocess executing a PowerShell command encoded in Base64. The subprocess uses flags to hide the window, indicating stealth intent. The Base64 string likely decodes to commands that may perform malicious actions, such as network communications or system modifications. The setup function is called with package metadata, wrapped in a try-except block, which suppresses errors but doesn't raise suspicion by itself. The presence of obfuscated PowerShell code executed silently indicates potential malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains obfuscated, hidden PowerShell code executed in a stealth manner, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. The setup metadata appears benign, but the embedded command execution warrants caution due to its obfuscation and hidden nature.",
