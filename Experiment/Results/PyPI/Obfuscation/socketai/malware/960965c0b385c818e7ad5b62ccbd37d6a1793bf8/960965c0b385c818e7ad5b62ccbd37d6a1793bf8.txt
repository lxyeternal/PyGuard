      "conclusion": "The code demonstrates suspicious and potentially malicious behavior through obfuscated, silent PowerShell execution during package setup. The high scores reflect the strong indicators of malicious activity, warranting further decoding and analysis of the PowerShell command. The package should be treated with caution until the command's content is verified."
