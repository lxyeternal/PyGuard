{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up a Python package and potentially execute a hidden PowerShell command during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the filesystem (checking if 'tahg' exists) and executes a PowerShell command via subprocess.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen call executes a Base64-encoded PowerShell command, which could be malicious if it performs harmful actions.",
  "flows": "The existence check for 'tahg' triggers the execution of the encoded PowerShell command; the setup function defines package metadata but is unrelated to the malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a Base64-encoded PowerShell command executed with 'powershell -EncodedCommand', especially within a setup script, is suspicious. The encoded string decodes to a command that could be malicious or unwanted. The try-except blocks suppress errors, hiding potential issues.",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally executes a PowerShell command encoded in Base64 when the 'tahg' directory does not exist. The encoded command is hidden, which suggests obfuscation. The command is executed with hidden window flags, which is common in malicious scripts to avoid detection. The setup call appears benign but is likely a cover or secondary function. The overall pattern—obfuscated command execution during setup—is suspicious and may be used for malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains suspicious behavior through obfuscated PowerShell execution during package setup, indicating potential malicious intent. The use of encoded commands and suppressed error handling suggests concealment. This code should be treated as malicious or at least highly suspicious.",
