{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define a setup script for a Python package, but includes malicious code intended to send hostname and IP address information to a Discord webhook during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the socket module to obtain hostname and IP address, and from the socket.gethostname() and socket.gethostbyname() functions.",
  "sinks": "The data is sent via a Discord webhook URL using the discord library, specifically through the Webhook.from_url() and send() methods.",
  "flows": "Data flows from socket.gethostname() and socket.gethostbyname() to the webhook's send() method, which transmits the information over the network to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual code includes the dynamic creation of a class with a seemingly random name, and the use of a webhook URL that appears to be used for data exfiltration. The code also references objects like Webhook and RequestsWebhookAdapter without explicit imports, indicating obfuscation or incomplete code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup tools but also introduces a class that overrides the install command. Within this class, it attempts to create a webhook connection to a Discord URL and send system information (hostname and IP address). This action occurs during package installation, which is suspicious. The use of a webhook for exfiltration is a strong indicator of malicious intent. There are no visible checks or protections; the code executes unconditionally during install. Some variables and class names appear obfuscated, adding to suspicion. The overall structure suggests an attempt to silently gather and transmit system info, typical of malicious behavior in supply chain attacks.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains clear malicious behavior, specifically data exfiltration via a Discord webhook during package installation. It leverages standard setup procedures to execute harmful actions, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent. This package should be considered dangerous and should not be used.",
