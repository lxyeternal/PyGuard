{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that appears to perform some form of notification or data reporting via Discord webhook during installation.",
  "sources": "The webhook URL hardcoded in the code; socket.gethostname() and socket.gethostbyname() calls to get system info.",
  "sinks": "Sending data to a Discord webhook URL, potentially exfiltrating hostname and IP address.",
  "flows": "On package installation, the custom install command collects hostname and IP, then sends this data to the webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, custom install class with obfuscated class name, and sending system info during installation are suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command class that, upon execution, retrieves the system's hostname and IP address, then sends this information to a specified Discord webhook URL. The webhook URL is hardcoded, and the code utilizes discord.py libraries but does not appear to perform any other legitimate package setup functions. The collection and exfiltration of system info during installation is suspicious and can be used maliciously to track or identify users without their consent. The obfuscated class name further raises suspicion, indicating possible malicious intent or covert behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information via a hardcoded Discord webhook during package installation. The purpose appears to be data collection or surveillance without user consent. Due to the presence of hardcoded exfiltration and obfuscation, it should be considered malicious.",
