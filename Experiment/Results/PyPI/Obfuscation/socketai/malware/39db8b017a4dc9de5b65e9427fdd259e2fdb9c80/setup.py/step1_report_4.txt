{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package, with a custom install command that attempts to send system hostname and IP address information via a Discord webhook during installation.",
  "sources": "The webhook URL and socket.gethostname(), socket.gethostbyname() calls read system information; the webhook URL is hardcoded.",
  "sinks": "The send() method on the webhook object transmits data over the network, potentially leaking system info.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom command retrieves system hostname and IP, then sends this data to the specified Discord webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes obfuscated class and method names, unusual variable names, and constructs a webhook payload with system info—potentially for tracking or malicious data exfiltration. The use of the 'discord' library and hardcoded webhook suggests an intent to send data externally. The code does not perform any other install-related tasks, which is unusual.",
  "analysis": "The script modifies the installation process to include a call that retrieves system hostname and IP address. It then constructs a Discord webhook object and sends this information externally. The webhook URL is hardcoded, which indicates an attempt to exfiltrate system information without user consent. The obfuscated class and method names suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent. No other malicious actions are evident; however, sending system info during installation is suspicious and could be used for tracking or malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system hostname and IP address during package installation via a hardcoded Discord webhook. The obfuscation and data transmission without user knowledge indicate potentially malicious intent. This package should be considered suspicious and potentially harmful.",
