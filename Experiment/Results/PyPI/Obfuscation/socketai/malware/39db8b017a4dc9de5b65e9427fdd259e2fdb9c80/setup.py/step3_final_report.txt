{
  "purpose": "The code exfiltrates system hostname and IP address during package installation via a hardcoded Discord webhook, indicating malicious behavior intended for covert data collection.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), socket.gethostbyname() functions used to retrieve hostname and IP address.",
  "sinks": "Webhook.send() method transmitting data to an external Discord webhook URL.",
  "flows": "System info obtained from socket functions flows into the webhook's content parameter, then sent over the network during install.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names; hardcoded webhook URL; data exfiltration during setup; use of discord library without explicit import statements for all components.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, during execution, creates a Discord webhook object with a hardcoded URL, retrieves hostname and IP address, and sends this information via the webhook. The obfuscated naming and direct network activity during installation are suspicious. The behavior aligns with malicious exfiltration tactics. The code lacks legitimate setup functionality and employs obfuscation to conceal intent. The exfiltration occurs during package installation, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.8-1, obfuscated ~0.7-0.8, security risk ~0.75-1) are justified, but given the clear malicious activity, they should be maximized. The code's intent is to covertly collect and transmit system info without user consent, indicating high malicious potential.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs covert data exfiltration during package installation, with obfuscation and hardcoded webhook URL, confirming malicious intent. The scores should be set to maximum levels (malware: 1, security risk: 1, obfuscated: ~0.8) to reflect the high severity and malicious nature of this package.",
