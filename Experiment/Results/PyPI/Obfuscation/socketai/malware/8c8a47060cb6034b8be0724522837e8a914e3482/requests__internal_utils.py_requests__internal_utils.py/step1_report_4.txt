  "purpose": "Utility functions for internal use within the Requests library, mainly for header validation and string encoding conversions.",
  "sources": "import statements, regex patterns, function parameters (strings, encodings), built-in string type checks.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; the functions perform string processing and validation without executing untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Input strings are checked or decoded; no untrusted data flows into dangerous sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system commands.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation detected. The code appears straightforward and consistent with standard utility functions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides regex-based validation for HTTP headers, which is standard practice. The 'to_native_string' function converts inputs to native string types, which is typical. The 'unicode_is_ascii' function checks if a unicode string contains only ASCII characters. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or system manipulation occurs. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. All functions seem safe and intended for normal processing within the Requests library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard utility code used for header validation and string processing in the Requests library. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be well-structured and safe.",
