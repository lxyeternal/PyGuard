{
  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for handling HTTP header validation and string conversions in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "The code reads from input parameters such as 'string' in 'to_native_string' and 'u_string' in 'unicode_is_ascii'.",
  "sinks": "The functions perform decoding, encoding checks, and regex validation; no direct sinks for untrusted data leading to system effects are present.",
  "flows": "Input strings are validated or converted; no data flows lead to system commands, external connections, or data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behavior are observed. The regex patterns are standard for HTTP header validation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines regex patterns for validating HTTP header names and values, and includes functions for string encoding conversion and ASCII validation. All functions operate on provided parameters without external calls or side effects. No network, file, or system commands are used. The functions rely on standard Python string operations and regex validation, with no evidence of malicious behavior or malicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign utility module for HTTP header validation and string encoding checks, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
