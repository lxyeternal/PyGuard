  "purpose": "Provides internal utility functions for handling headers and string conversions within the Requests library.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input parameters such as 'string', 'encoding', and 'u_string'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that lead to data leaks or external effects; no untrusted data is written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Input data (parameters) is processed internally with no external data flow or output outside the functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code uses standard regex patterns and simple string operations; no obfuscated code or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines regex patterns for header validation, a function to convert various string types to native string, and a function to check if a Unicode string is ASCII-only. The functions perform straightforward validation and conversion without external system calls or data transmissions. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The regex patterns are used for header validation and do not pose security issues. String conversions are standard and safe. No suspicious or malicious activity detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be standard utility functions for handling string and header validation with no malicious intent or security risks.",
