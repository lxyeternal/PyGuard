{
  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for internal use within the requests library, mainly for header validation and string handling.",
  "sources": "Imports re module; uses 'compat' module for 'builtin_str'; reads input via function parameters (strings, bytes).",
  "sinks": "No sinks that lead to data leakage or untrusted data processing. No system commands, network calls, or file operations.",
  "flows": "Input data (strings or bytes) are validated and converted; no external untrusted data flows into sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code performs straightforward validation and conversion.",
  "analysis": "The code defines regex patterns for header validation, a function to convert any input to native string, and a function to check if a unicode string is ASCII. No external network, file, or system modifications are present. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The functions perform standard validation and string handling operations typical of library utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign utility functions for internal requests handling, with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
