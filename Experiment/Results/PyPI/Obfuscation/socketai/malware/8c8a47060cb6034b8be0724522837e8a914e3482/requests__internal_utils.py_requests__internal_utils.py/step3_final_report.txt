  "purpose": "Utility functions for header validation and string conversion within the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Input data from function parameters, specifically 'string' in 'to_native_string' and 'u_string' in 'unicode_is_ascii'.",
  "sinks": "None; functions perform internal processing without external data sinks or system effects.",
  "flows": "Input data is decoded or checked within the functions; no external data flow or network activity occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of decode() and encode() on untrusted input, but this is standard string handling and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code provides regex patterns for header validation and functions for string conversion and ASCII checking. All operations are standard, safe, and do not involve external system calls or network activity. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The only minor concern is the decoding of potentially untrusted input, but this is typical in string handling and does not constitute a security risk. The malware score is correctly 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score should be 0, reflecting the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, safe utility module with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with a minor adjustment to the security risk score in report 3 from 0.2 to 0 for consistency.",
