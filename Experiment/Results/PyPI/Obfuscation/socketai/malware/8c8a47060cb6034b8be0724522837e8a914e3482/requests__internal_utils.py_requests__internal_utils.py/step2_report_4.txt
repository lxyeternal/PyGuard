  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** Describes the code as internal utility functions for header validation and string conversion. No suspicious activity, no external effects, no anomalies.\n- **Assessment:** The code is straightforward, uses regex for validation, and performs safe string operations. No malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, confirms benign utility functions for header validation and string handling. No external effects or malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion; functions are standard, safe, and well-understood.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Again, utility functions for header validation and string conversion. Mentions potential sinks (decode/encode) but notes these are standard operations.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious behavior. The decode and encode are typical for string processing, not malicious. The securityRisk score is 0.2, possibly reflecting minor concern about decoding input, but overall very low.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — acceptable given the context.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Same as above, standard utility functions, no external effects, no anomalies.\n- **Assessment:** Clear, safe, standard code. No malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion, benign utility functions, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity, straightforward code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently indicate no malicious activity. The code is utility in nature, with no network, file, or external command execution. **Malware score should be 0**.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is clear, straightforward, and uses standard regex and string operations. No obfuscation detected. **Obfuscated score should be 0**.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Given the functions' simplicity and benign nature, the risk score should be very low. The only minor concern in one report was about decoding, but that does not constitute a real security risk. Therefore, **risk score should be 0** or possibly 0.1 if we want to acknowledge minimal processing concerns, but 0 is more accurate.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is standard, safe utility functions with no malicious intent or security issues.",
