  "purpose": "Compatibility layer for handling import issues and version differences between Python 2 and Python 3, including fallback mechanisms for optional dependencies.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules like chardet, simplejson, collections, urllib, sys, and environment variables for version detection.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; primarily static import and variable assignment operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard compatibility practices.",
  "analysis": "The code performs import fallbacks, version detection, and sets compatibility variables. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or risky constructs. The logic is straightforward, with no external data handling or network activity. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with its benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe compatibility module with no security concerns or malicious intent. All reports correctly characterize it as benign, and the scoring aligns with its functionality.",
