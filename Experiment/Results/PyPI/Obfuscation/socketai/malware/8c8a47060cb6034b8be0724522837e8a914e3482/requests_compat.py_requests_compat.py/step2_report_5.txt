  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- All reports consistently describe the code as a straightforward compatibility and import management module.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are identified.\n- The code performs conditional imports, version checks, and sets up variables for cross-version compatibility.\n- No data processing, external network calls, or handling of untrusted input are present.\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, aligning with the analysis.\n- The security risk is also 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n- The code does not contain any hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors.\n- The import fallbacks and version checks are standard practices.\n- No anomalies or suspicious constructs are detected.\n- The purpose and sources are consistent with typical compatibility modules.\n- The flows do not involve untrusted data or external effects.\n\n**Scores and justification:**\n\n- The malware score of 0 is justified; no malicious activity is present.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is justified; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- The overall security risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n**Potential adjustments:**\n\n- Given the analysis, the current scores are appropriate and should remain unchanged.\n- The confidence level of 1 is justified due to the clear and standard nature of the code.\n\n**Final estimation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a benign, standard compatibility module with no security risks or malware indications. The current reports and scores are accurate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the code as safe, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.",
