{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility shims and utility imports for Python 2 and 3 in the requests library, facilitating cross-version support.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from sys.version_info; imports chardet or charset_normalizer; conditionally imports simplejson; imports various standard library modules and functions related to URL handling, cookies, and string types.",
  "sinks": "Uses imported modules for data processing and parsing; no direct data sinks identified that could lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "Collects version info, conditionally imports modules, defines type aliases, and sets up compatibility structures without processing untrusted input or executing external commands.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or misleading variables observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up environment compatibility and imports necessary modules for the larger requests library. It employs standard practices for fallback imports, version detection, and compatibility shims. No code injections, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code is straightforward and adheres to typical compatibility patterns. No suspicious activity or anomalies detected.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard compatibility and import setup module for the requests library. It contains no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears safe and intended solely for environment setup.",
