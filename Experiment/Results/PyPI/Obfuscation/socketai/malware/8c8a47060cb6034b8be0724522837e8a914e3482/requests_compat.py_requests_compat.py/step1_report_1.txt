{
  "purpose": "The module provides compatibility functions and imports for handling differences between Python 2 and Python 3, and manages import fallback for certain libraries.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard libraries, conditional imports for 'chardet', 'simplejson', and other modules, and variable assignments based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted input or data leading to security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Imports and variable assignments do not involve untrusted data flow. No data processing or external communications are performed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscated segments. All code is straightforward, standard for compatibility modules.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles imports with conditional fallbacks and defines some version-specific variables. There are no input handling, data processing, or external communications. No hardcoded secrets or sensitive data are present. The use of try-except for optional dependencies is standard practice. The code does not perform any operations that could be malicious or harmful.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility and import management module without any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign part of a larger project.",
