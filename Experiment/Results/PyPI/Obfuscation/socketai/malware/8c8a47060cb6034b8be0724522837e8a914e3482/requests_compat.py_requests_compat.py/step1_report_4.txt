{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility functions and imports for handling different Python versions and dependencies in the requests library.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment (via sys.version_info), module imports (chardet, simplejson, json), and some standard library functions and classes.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; no untrusted data is processed or written to external systems.",
  "flows": "No flow of untrusted data from sources to sinks is observed; imports are static and do not involve dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs detected. The code primarily performs imports and defines compatibility variables.",
  "analysis": "The code is a compatibility and import management module for Python 2 and 3, handling optional dependencies and standard library imports. It does not process external input or perform any system modifications. No potentially malicious patterns such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. It also does not contain obfuscation or hidden code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard compatibility module without any malicious intent. It manages imports and compatibility across Python versions safely. No security risks or malware signals are detected.",
