{
  "purpose": "This module handles compatibility and import resolution issues for the 'requests' library, including fallback mechanisms for optional dependencies and Python version differences.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment information (Python version via sys.version_info), imports optional modules (chardet, simplejson), and loads standard libraries and functions from various modules (collections, http, io, urllib).",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that process untrusted data in a way that leads to data leaks or code execution. It primarily imports modules and assigns variables.",
  "flows": "The code flows from reading environment and version info, conditionally importing modules (chardet, simplejson), and assigning variables. No data flows from external sources to vulnerable sinks.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, unusual code, or suspicious behavior. The code appears to be standard compatibility boilerplate.",
  "analysis": "The code is a compatibility shim for the requests library, importing necessary modules and handling differences between Python 2 and Python 3. It uses try-except blocks to conditionally import optional modules (chardet, simplejson). There are no network operations, no data manipulation, and no execution of untrusted input. The code is straightforward and standard for a library of this nature. It does not include any obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard, harmless compatibility code with no signs of malicious intent. It primarily manages imports and environment detection without processing or transmitting untrusted data.",
