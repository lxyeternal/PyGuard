  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checkting the code, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a standard compatibility module for the 'requests' library, handling imports and version differences.\n- All reports agree that there are no suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated parts.\n- The code only performs import management, version detection, and compatibility setup.\n- No untrusted data handling, external network operations, or code execution is present.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n#### 1. **Purpose & Sources**\n- All reports correctly identify the purpose as managing compatibility and import fallbacks.\n- The sources (import statements, version info) are accurately described.\n\n#### 2. **Sinks & Flows**\n- No data sinks or flows involving untrusted data, external inputs, or outputs are present.\n- The code's flow is static, mainly setting variables and importing modules.\n\n#### 3. **Anomalies & Analysis**\n- No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscation are detected.\n- The reasoning that the code is benign and standard is sound.\n\n#### 4. **Conclusion & Scores**\n- The conclusion that the code is safe and benign is justified.\n- The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- **Scores:** No changes needed; all reports' scores are reasonable.\n- **Risk justification:** Since the code only handles imports and version detection without any data processing, external communication, or code execution, the risk score remains zero.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** Both correctly set to zero; no malicious intent or obfuscation detected.\n- **Security Risk:** Correctly zero, as no vulnerabilities or security issues are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated malware score:** **0**  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Estimated risk score:** **0**\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a benign, standard compatibility module with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. All reports are consistent, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe analysis confirms that this code is safe, with scores aligned with its functionality. It is a typical compatibility setup used in many projects, and there are no security concerns.",
