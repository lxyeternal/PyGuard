  "purpose": "Compatibility and utility functions for handling different Python versions and import resolution.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, import statements for modules like chardet, charset_normalizer, simplejson, json, collections, http, io, urllib.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or external effects; primarily import statements and variable definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only sets up imports and compatibility variables.",
  "anomalies": "Use of fallback import for chardet, conditional import of simplejson, no hardcoded secrets or credentials, straightforward version compatibility code. No obfuscation or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly handles module imports and compatibility adjustments between Python 2 and 3. It conditionally imports modules like chardet and simplejson, setting flags accordingly. The rest involves defining compatibility variables and importing standard libraries without any data processing or external network interactions. No suspicious or malicious patterns detected, and no data leaks or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign compatibility module with no malicious intent. It manages imports and version checks cleanly and securely without any suspicious behavior.",
