  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's behavior, data flows, and potential security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The report correctly identifies that the code reads data from input parameters and raw response objects.\n- **Sinks:** The potential sinks (request body, headers, cookies, response content) are standard for HTTP handling.\n- **Flows:** Data flows from user inputs into request preparation, and response content back into internal attributes.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The code is a typical implementation of an HTTP client.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity detected.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0.1 (low, standard code)  \n\n**Verdict:** The report's assessment aligns with the code's behavior. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar accurate description of data flow from URL, headers, etc.\n- **Sinks:** Standard encoding, header, and response handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious code or backdoors. The code handles URL parsing, encoding, and response decoding securely.\n- **Conclusion:** No evidence of malicious intent.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2 (still low, typical implementation)  \n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is reasonable. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; covers request/response handling.\n- **Sinks:** Encodes parameters, manages headers, cookies, JSON, and response content.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns or obfuscation. The code is standard.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of sabotage or malicious activity.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0 (no security concern)\n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusion is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the request/response lifecycle.\n- **Sinks:** Standard data flows into request preparation and response handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious or suspicious patterns. Proper validation and encoding are used.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2 (low, standard code)\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes the module's role.\n- **Sinks:** Request bodies, headers, response content.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, well-structured code.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0 (safe)\n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusion is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports consistently assign 0, which is accurate. The code is a standard HTTP request/response handling module without malicious payloads or behaviors.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, which is correct; the code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1–0.2), reflecting low inherent risk typical for such libraries.\n\n### My final estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Clear, well-structured code.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — Minimal, standard security risk for an HTTP client library.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code appears secure, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
