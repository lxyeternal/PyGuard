{
  "purpose": "The code implements a standard HTTP request and response handling mechanism, including request preparation, encoding, header validation, cookie management, and response parsing.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as URL, headers, data, files, JSON payloads, cookies, and hooks; raw response stream.",
  "sinks": "Request body, headers, cookies, and response content where untrusted data could flow into network transmission or data processing.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into request construction (encoding, headers, cookies), and from raw response streams into parsed content and response attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. The code follows standard practices for HTTP client implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured, standard implementation of an HTTP client component, handling URL parsing, encoding, headers, cookies, JSON serialization, and response decoding securely. No signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or obfuscation are present. The data flows are typical for such modules, with proper validation and error handling. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are evident. The code's clarity and adherence to best practices reduce the likelihood of hidden malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure, and standard HTTP request/response handling module with no indications of sabotage, malware, or malicious behavior. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting the benign nature of the implementation.",
