  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states that the code is standard, with no malicious or sabotage behavior, and that data flows are typical for an HTTP client.\n\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.1, confidence = 0.95\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is well-structured, handles encoding, headers, cookies, and responses securely, with no suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors detected.\n\n- **Justification:** The low security risk score (0.1) aligns with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious activity. The malware score of 0 is justified, given no evidence of malicious code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard request/response handling, no hardcoded credentials, and proper encoding.\n\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.2, confidence = 0.95\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent with the code, which performs typical HTTP client functions securely.\n\n- **Justification:** The slightly higher securityRisk (0.2) still reflects a minimal risk, consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates that the code is a standard implementation with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.\n\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0, confidence = 0.9\n\n- **Assessment:** The code handles request/response processing properly, with no suspicious patterns.\n\n- **Justification:** The zero malware score is justified; no malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is a standard HTTP request/response handler with no evidence of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.2, confidence = 0.9\n\n- **Assessment:** The code's structure and handling are typical, with no suspicious or malicious patterns.\n\n- **Justification:** The low securityRisk score aligns with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Confirms the code is standard, with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage.\n\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0, confidence = 1\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Evaluation\n\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code. All reports agree on its benign, standard nature.\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is justified.\n\n- **Security risk:** Very low, mostly 0 or 0.2, reflecting the code's standard, secure handling.\n\n- **Confidence:** High across all reports, indicating strong agreement.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations & Final Scores\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation patterns)\n- **Security risk:** 0.1–0.2 seems appropriate; given the code's benign nature, I suggest **0.1** for an even more conservative estimate.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95 (consistent with the reports)\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification\n\nThe code is a typical, well-structured HTTP request/response handling module. No suspicious patterns, malicious behaviors, or sabotage signals are evident. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and no changes are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score | Justification                                               |\n|-----------------|------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 0               | 0                | 0.1          | No malicious or obfuscated code; standard, secure implementation |\n\n**Conclusion:** The supply chain security risk for this code is minimal, and it appears safe.",
