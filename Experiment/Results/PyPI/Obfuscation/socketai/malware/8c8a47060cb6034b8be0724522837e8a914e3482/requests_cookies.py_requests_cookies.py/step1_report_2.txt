  "anomalies": [
    "No hardcoded credentials or secrets present.",
    "Standard cookie management code with no obfuscation or unusual constructs.",
    "Use of threading.RLock for thread safety is standard, not suspicious.",
    "Functions that manipulate cookies (set, get, remove) are straightforward.",
    "No network connections or data exfiltration routines are present.",
    "Serialization methods are standard for pickleability."
  ],
  "analysis": "The code implements cookie management and compatibility functions for requests, including cookie extraction, setting, deletion, and merging. All functions perform typical cookie handling tasks with clear, well-defined purposes. No hardcoded secrets, malicious network activity, or backdoors are detected. The use of threading locks and mock request/response wrappers aligns with standard library practices. No suspicious code flows, obfuscated code, or anomalous behaviors are observed. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate utility module for cookie handling without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a standard implementation of cookie management utilities for requests, with no indications of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. It provides necessary functions for cookie handling in a typical, expected manner.",
