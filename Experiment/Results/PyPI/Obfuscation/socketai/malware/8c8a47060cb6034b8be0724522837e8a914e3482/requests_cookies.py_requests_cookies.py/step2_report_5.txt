  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes standard cookie handling utilities, mock request/response wrappers, extraction, and cookie creation.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Cookie extraction, header manipulation, and cookie creation flow are typical.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious activity detected. Uses standard libraries and patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate cookie management code, no malware or security risks.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (low, due to general utility code, not active security concern).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar purpose—cookie utilities, cookie jar management, extraction, creation.\n- No anomalies or suspicious code.\n- All functions perform standard tasks.\n- Scores: Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (very low).\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focused on cookie extraction, management, and conversion.\n- No signs of malicious activity.\n- Scores: Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Standard cookie handling, extraction, header creation.\n- No suspicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- Scores: Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Utility functions for cookie management, similar to others.\n- No anomalies or malicious intent.\n- Scores: Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Review & Justification:\n\n- **Presence of Malware:** All reports consistently indicate no malicious activity, no network activity, no backdoors, no obfuscation. The code is clearly utility functions for cookie handling.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected; code is straightforward and standard.\n- **Risk Scores:** Given the nature of the code (utility functions for cookie management), a low security risk score is appropriate. The highest is 0.2, which seems reasonable.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** Both are 0 across all reports, justified by the straightforward, standard implementation.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation or hidden code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (minimal, due to being utility code with no active security concerns)\n\n**Overall, I would assign:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is standard, legitimate, and free of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Estimate |\n|----------------|----------------|\n| Malware        | 0              |\n| Obfuscated     | 0              |\n| Security Risk  | 0.1            |\n\nThe code is a typical, benign utility module for cookie handling with no security concerns.",
