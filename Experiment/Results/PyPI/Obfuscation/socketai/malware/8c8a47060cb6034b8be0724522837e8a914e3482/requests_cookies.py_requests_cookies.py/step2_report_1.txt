  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the presence of issues, logical consistency, and the appropriateness of the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes utility functions/classes for cookie management, matching the code.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Cookie extraction, setting, removal, and header manipulation are correctly identified.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious behaviors detected. The code is standard for cookie handling.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** High confidence (0.9), no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report is accurate. The code is a standard cookie utility module with no malicious intent. The security risk score of 0.2 seems slightly conservative but acceptable given the nature of the code. Malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, with detailed mention of functions and classes.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly notes cookie manipulation, extraction, merging, and header management.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation or suspicious patterns. Use of threading lock is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Very high confidence (1.0), no malware, obfuscation, or security concerns.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe analysis is consistent with the code. The malware score of 0 is appropriate. The security risk score of 0.1 is reasonable, reflecting minimal risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes the code's role in cookie handling, matching the code.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Accurately details cookie extraction, creation, and management.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but still justified; no malware or security issues.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report's conclusion aligns with the code's functionality. The malware score of 0 is justified; no malicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as cookie utility functions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Accurate mapping of data flow and cookie management.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, secrets, or network activity.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** High confidence (1.0), no malware or security risks.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe analysis is thorough and accurate. The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code's utility role.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Properly notes cookie extraction, creation, merging, and header generation.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious features or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Slightly lower confidence (0.95), but still consistent with the code.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report is accurate. Malware score of 0 is justified; no malicious activity is present.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify the code as cookie management utilities.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which is consistent with the code.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly conservative but acceptable scores, given the code's benign nature.\n- **Logical consistency:** All reports are thorough, accurate, and aligned with the code.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.  \n**Risk Score:** 0.1–0.2 — minimal, given the utility nature; no security risks detected.\n\n**Overall:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-implemented cookie utility module with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or supply chain issues. The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI agree with the reports' assessments. The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements, and the security risk is negligible. The scores should remain as they are, with perhaps a slight adjustment of the overall risk score to 0.1–0.2 for completeness.",
