  "purpose": "This code provides compatibility utilities for handling cookies within the requests library, including classes and functions to manage cookies, convert cookies from different formats, and manipulate CookieJars.",
  "sources": "Requests and responses: imports and uses request objects, response headers, and cookie data. Reads input from request objects and response headers.",
  "sinks": "Cookie manipulation functions, especially 'extract_cookies_to_jar', 'set_cookie', 'remove_cookie_by_name', and 'create_cookie' which modify CookieJars and cookies. Functions like 'get_cookie_header' send cookies in request headers.",
  "flows": "Cookies are extracted from response headers into CookieJar; cookies are retrieved and set via functions like 'get_cookie_header' and 'set'; cookies can be removed or merged, with data flowing from request/response objects into cookie jars and vice versa.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code or unusual language features. No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No hidden network connections, reverse shells, or data exfiltration mechanisms detected. Functions perform standard cookie management tasks without malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily implements cookie management and compatibility layers for requests, including classes for cookie jars with dict-like interfaces, functions to create, convert, and manipulate cookies, and mechanisms to extract cookies from HTTP responses. It uses standard libraries and follows typical patterns for cookie handling. No suspicious code, network activity, or malicious behavior is evident. The functions appear to be standard, secure, and intended for legitimate use within HTTP client workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for cookie handling in the requests library, with no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. It provides compatibility and cookie management features common in HTTP client implementations, and there are no signs of malware or security risks.",
