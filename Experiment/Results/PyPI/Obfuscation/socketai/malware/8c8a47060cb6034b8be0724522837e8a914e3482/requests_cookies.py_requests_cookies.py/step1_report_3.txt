{
  "purpose": "This code provides compatibility utilities for handling cookies within the requests library, including mock request/response wrappers, cookie extraction, cookie management, and conversions between cookie formats.",
  "sources": "Reading HTTP headers from response objects, accessing request URLs and headers, extracting cookies into a CookieJar, and creating/modifying cookies and cookie jars.",
  "sinks": "Methods that modify cookie jars (set, update, remove_cookie_by_name), header manipulations, and cookie extraction functions that process response headers.",
  "flows": "Response headers are read in 'extract_cookies_to_jar', which feeds into cookie jar updates; cookie creation and modification functions manipulate cookies based on input parameters; request headers and URLs are accessed for cookie handling and request simulation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors. The code appears to be standard cookie handling and compatibility code. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are detected. No network or system modification actions are present.",
  "analysis": "The code offers utility functions and classes to manage cookies in HTTP requests, including mock request/response wrappers for cookie extraction, cookie jar manipulation, cookie creation, and conversion. The implementation relies on standard libraries and safe patterns. No evidence of malicious activities such as data exfiltration, network connections to suspicious domains, or hidden backdoors is observed. The code is consistent with typical cookie handling functionality, with no anomalies or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate compatibility and utility code for cookie management within the requests library. It does not contain malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The functionality is standard, and no indicators of compromise are detected.",
