  "purpose": "Provides utility functions and classes for cookie management within the requests library, including extraction, creation, merging, and header handling.",
  "sources": "Request and response headers, cookie parameters, Morsel objects, input dictionaries for cookie creation.",
  "sinks": "Cookie extraction into jar, setting cookie headers, removing cookies, merging cookies, and serializing cookie jars.",
  "flows": "Input data from request/response headers and parameters flow into cookie objects and are stored or manipulated within cookie jars; cookie headers are generated for requests.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious code detected; code is straightforward and standard for cookie handling.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard cookie management utilities, including mock wrappers for request/response, extraction functions, cookie creation, and cookie jar management. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or network activity are present. The functions follow typical patterns, and the code is well-structured. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or sabotage. The use of threading locks is standard and appropriate. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign, utility nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-implemented cookie utility module with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard cookie handling tasks without obfuscation or malicious activity. The assigned scores are appropriate and reflect the benign nature of the code.",
