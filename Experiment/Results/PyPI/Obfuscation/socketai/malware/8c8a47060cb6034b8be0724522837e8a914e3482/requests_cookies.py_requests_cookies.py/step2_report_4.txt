  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, obfuscation, and overall security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes utility functions/classes for cookie handling; sources are standard request/response objects.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Cookie extraction, header management, cookie creation, merging—standard flows.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, no secrets, no network activity. Functions perform typical cookie management.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate utility code, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 (low risk, typical for such code).\n\n**Assessment:** The code is standard, with no signs of malicious intent. The low security risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar utility functions/classes for cookie management.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Cookie extraction, setting, removal, merging—standard operations.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, secrets, or network activity. Uses threading locks properly.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, standard cookie management code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 (very low).\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious indicators. The score aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Cookie utilities, wrappers for request/response, extraction, creation.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Cookie extraction, header setting, jar manipulation—expected behavior.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious activity. Functions are standard.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate utility code, no security concerns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues; scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Cookie handling, extraction, creation, management.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Standard cookie jar operations, header creation.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, secrets, or network activity. Functions are straightforward.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, well-structured cookie management code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious signs; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Cookie utilities, extraction, creation, management.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Standard flows, no unusual activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, secrets, or network activity. No signs of malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** Typical cookie management code, safe and legitimate.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues; scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports indicate no obfuscation.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign malware scores of 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Risk Scores:** Very low, reflecting the benign nature of cookie management utilities.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no signs of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, standard code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1–0.2 (minimal security risk, typical for such utility code)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, well-implemented cookie management utility module with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed; the code appears safe and legitimate.",
