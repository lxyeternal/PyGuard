  "conclusion": "The presence of exec() on base64-encoded payloads, particularly those that fetch and execute remote code, is a strong indicator of malicious activity. The pattern of obfuscation and remote code execution warrants high suspicion. The overall security risk is very high, and such code should be flagged and reviewed thoroughly before use."
