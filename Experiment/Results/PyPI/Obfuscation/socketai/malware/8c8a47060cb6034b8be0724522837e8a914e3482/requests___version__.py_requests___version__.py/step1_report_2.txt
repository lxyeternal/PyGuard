  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'requests' Python library.",
  "sources": "Constants and string assignments (e.g., __title__, __description__, __url__, __version__, __build__, __author__, __author_email__, __license__, __copyright__, __cake__).",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A – only static metadata assignments, no data flow from source to sink.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code solely contains metadata variable assignments with static strings and numeric values.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward metadata declaration for the 'requests' package, including version, author, license, and descriptive info. It contains no input handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution. No suspicious behavior, malicious code, or obfuscation detected. The only potential concern could be if these variables were manipulated elsewhere, but within this fragment, they appear to be static metadata.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving solely as package metadata. No malicious or security-threatening behavior is present.",
