  "purpose": "This code defines metadata attributes for a Python package named 'requests', providing information such as title, description, URL, version, author, license, and copyright.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or untrusted data; it only assigns string and numeric literals to variables.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or interact with external systems in a way that could leak information or cause harm.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink exists; the code simply initializes metadata variables without any input or output operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code consists solely of variable assignments with static data.",
  "analysis": "The script contains only static metadata definitions for the 'requests' library. No input handling, data processing, network operations, or malicious constructs are present. The comments and decorative ASCII art do not influence code behavior. The code appears standard for package metadata.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and purely informational, serving as metadata for the package. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
