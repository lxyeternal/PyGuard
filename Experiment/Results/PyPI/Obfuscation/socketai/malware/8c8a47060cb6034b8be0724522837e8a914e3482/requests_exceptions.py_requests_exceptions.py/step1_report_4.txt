  "purpose": "Defines a set of exception classes for the requests library to handle various network errors and warnings.",
  "sources": "Imports from urllib3.exceptions and .compat; internal class methods and attributes.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; code does not process untrusted data or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code is primarily class definitions and imports without data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions extending standard exception hierarchies for handling network errors. It imports exceptions and defines custom exceptions with clear documentation. No dynamic code execution, input handling, or data processing is present that could introduce security risks or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard, benign exception class definitions for the requests library. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks.",
