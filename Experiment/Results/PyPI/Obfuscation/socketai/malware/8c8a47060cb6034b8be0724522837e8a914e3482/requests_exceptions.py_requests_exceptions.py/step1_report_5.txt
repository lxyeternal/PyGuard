{
  "purpose": "This module defines exception classes used by the Requests library to handle various HTTP and network-related errors.",
  "sources": "The code reads class definitions and imports, and handles exception initialization with arguments and attributes.",
  "sinks": "There are no obvious sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or harmful actions, as this code only defines exception classes.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; exception handling is standard and confined to class initialization.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The code uses standard exception class inheritance and initialization.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of exception classes for the Requests library, including custom exceptions and warnings. It imports standard exceptions, defines subclasses with constructors, and adds docstrings. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. There are no dynamic code execution, external data processing, or suspicious logic. The structure is typical for a well-documented exception module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious set of exception class definitions for the Requests library, with no signs of malware or security issues.",
