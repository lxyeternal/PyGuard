  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the provided information step-by-step.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code consists solely of class definitions for exceptions related to the requests library.\n- All reports agree that the code imports external exceptions and defines subclasses with constructors and docstrings.\n- No dynamic code, data processing, or network operations are present.\n- No suspicious, obfuscated, or malicious constructs are identified.\n- The code appears to be a standard, well-structured exception module.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no malicious behavior, straightforward exception class definitions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The security risk score of 0.1 seems slightly high given the benign nature. No malicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident.\n- **Recommendation:** Reduce securityRisk to 0.0, as the code is purely defining exceptions with no security implications.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, standard exception classes, no anomalies or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, the security risk score appears overstated.\n- **Recommendation:** Lower securityRisk to 0.0.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Consistent with previous assessments; standard exception classes, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct; no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Same conclusion; code is benign, purely class definitions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above; no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall evaluation:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with straightforward class definitions.\n- **Risk score:** Slight overestimation in the first two reports; the code does not pose any security risk.\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n\nThis code is a standard, benign exception class definition module with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The code is legitimate, with no signs of malware or obfuscation.\n- The scores in reports 1 and 2 for security risk should be lowered from 0.1 to 0.0.\n- All other scores are appropriate.\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
