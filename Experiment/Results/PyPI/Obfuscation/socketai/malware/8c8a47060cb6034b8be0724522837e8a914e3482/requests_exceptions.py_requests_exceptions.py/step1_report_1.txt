  "purpose": "Define a set of exception classes for handling various errors and warnings in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "The code primarily imports exceptions from external libraries (urllib3.exceptions, .compat). No direct input sources are present; exception handling is internally managed.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; the code only defines exception classes and does not perform data operations or network communications directly.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present; the code only establishes exception hierarchies and constructors.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward, defining exception classes with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from standard Python exceptions, designed to handle different error scenarios within the requests library. It imports external exception classes for compatibility and error handling. No code injections, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. The classes primarily serve to categorize errors, with some constructors preserving error messages or wrapping external exceptions. No suspicious or malicious activity is evident. Overall, the code is a typical exception definition module with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard exception class definitions for the requests library, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It functions solely to categorize and handle errors without involving external data or executing untrusted code.",
