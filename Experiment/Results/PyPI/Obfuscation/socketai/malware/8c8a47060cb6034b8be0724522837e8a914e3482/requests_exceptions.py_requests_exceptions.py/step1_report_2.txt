{
  "purpose": "This module defines exception classes related to request handling errors and warnings for the Requests library.",
  "sources": "The code reads input and data mainly from exception handling contexts and attributes of objects such as 'response', 'request', and arguments passed during exception instantiation.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data can potentially flow into the exception message or object attributes, but there are no obvious sinks where untrusted data leads to system compromise or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Exceptions are raised or instantiated based on data from response or request objects; flows are typical error handling flows within HTTP request processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns detected. The code uses standard exception class inheritance, normal attribute handling, and clear structure. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation identified.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a series of exception classes for various error conditions in HTTP request handling, with appropriate inheritance and docstrings. It imports exceptions from external modules and extends them. The constructor methods mainly initialize exception instances with relevant context data. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors, and the code appears to be standard exception handling logic for a well-known library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of exception classes for the Requests library with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely manages error reporting and does not perform any network operations, data leaks, or system modifications. The overall security risk is minimal.",
