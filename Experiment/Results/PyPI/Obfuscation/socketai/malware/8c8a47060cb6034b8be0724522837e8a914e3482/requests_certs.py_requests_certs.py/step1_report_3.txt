{
  "purpose": "Provides the default CA certificate bundle location used by requests or other HTTP libraries.",
  "sources": "The 'where' function imported from the 'certifi' package and the print statement that outputs its value.",
  "sinks": "The printed CA bundle path could be read by any process or user, but no untrusted data is involved in processing.",
  "flows": "The code imports 'where' from certifi, then prints its value; data flows from the certifi package to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward, importing a standard library function and printing its value.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a function from a well-known package and prints its output. There are no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic execution, no network activity, and no suspicious behaviors. The code is minimal, transparent, and intended to inform users of the CA bundle location.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving only to output the location of the default CA bundle. It poses no security risks or malicious behavior.",
