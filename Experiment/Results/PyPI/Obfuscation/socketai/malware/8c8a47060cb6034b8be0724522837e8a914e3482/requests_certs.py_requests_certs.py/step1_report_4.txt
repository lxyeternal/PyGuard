{
  "purpose": "This script outputs the default CA bundle location used by the requests library, primarily for configuration or informational purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the CA bundle path from the 'certifi' package via the 'where' function.",
  "sinks": "The code itself does not process untrusted data or perform any actions that could lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "The source (certifi.where()) provides the CA bundle path, which is then printed; no flow of untrusted data occurs.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors present in the code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a well-known and trusted package, certifi, to obtain the default CA bundle location. It only prints this path when run as a main program. The code is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or external data processing. It appears to be a utility or debugging script intended to show configuration details. There are no signs of malicious intent or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended to display the default CA bundle path, and does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
