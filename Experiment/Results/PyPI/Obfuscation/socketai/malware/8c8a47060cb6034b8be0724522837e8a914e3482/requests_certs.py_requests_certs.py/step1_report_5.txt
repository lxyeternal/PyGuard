{
  "purpose": "To provide the default CA certificate bundle location used by the requests library, primarily for SSL verification purposes.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'where' function from the 'certifi' package.",
  "sinks": "The 'print(where())' statement outputs the CA bundle path, which is considered a trusted source of data.",
  "flows": "The 'where()' function retrieves the CA bundle path from the certifi package and outputs it via print.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code straightforwardly retrieves and displays the CA bundle location without any unusual code patterns or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script is simple, importing a trusted function from 'certifi' and printing its result. It does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or contain any code that could be exploited for malicious activity. The use of certifi is standard for SSL certificate validation. No suspicious or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility script that outputs the default CA bundle path used by requests. There is no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks present.",
