{
  "purpose": "Returns the default CA certificate bundle path from the certifi package, primarily for informational or packaging purposes.",
  "sources": "Import of 'where' from the 'certifi' package; execution of 'print(where())' when run as main.",
  "sinks": "Output to standard output via print; no untrusted data sinks or external connections.",
  "flows": "Import 'where' -> call 'where()' -> print the result.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected; straightforward use of trusted library functions.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing a trusted function and printing its output. It does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. The purpose is purely informational, aiding in packaging or environment setup. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and reliance on well-maintained libraries reduce false positives. All signals indicate benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility that outputs the path to the default CA bundle. It poses no security threat or malicious activity. The provided reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
