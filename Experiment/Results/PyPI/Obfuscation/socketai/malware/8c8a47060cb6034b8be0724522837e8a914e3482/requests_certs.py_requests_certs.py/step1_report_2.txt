{
  "purpose": "Provides the default CA certificate bundle path using the certifi package.",
  "sources": "Import statement: 'from certifi import where'; code execution in the main block: 'print(where())'.",
  "sinks": "Outputting the CA bundle path via print, which could be captured or redirected but is standard behavior.",
  "flows": "Import certifi.where() -> print(where()) in main block.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic. The code is straightforward and uses standard library functions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'where' function from the 'certifi' package, then prints the path to the CA bundle if run as a script. It is a simple utility script without any data input or external network interactions. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. It solely reports a file path, which is a benign operation. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility script that outputs the location of the trusted CA certificates provided by the 'certifi' package. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
