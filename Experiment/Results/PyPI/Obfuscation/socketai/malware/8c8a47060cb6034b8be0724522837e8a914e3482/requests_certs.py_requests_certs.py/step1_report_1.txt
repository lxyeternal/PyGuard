{
  "purpose": "To provide the path to the default CA certificate bundle used by requests or similar libraries.",
  "sources": "The 'where' function imported from the 'certifi' package.",
  "sinks": "The 'print(where())' statement outputs the CA bundle path to standard output.",
  "flows": "The 'where' function reads the default CA bundle location; the output is printed to the console.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and uses standard library functions without hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function 'where' from the 'certifi' package to retrieve the default CA bundle path. It then prints this path if executed as the main program. The script does not process untrusted data, does not connect to external sources, and only outputs the CA bundle location. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code. The purpose appears to be informational, aiding packaging or environment configuration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and simply outputs the location of the default CA certificate bundle provided by 'certifi'. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
