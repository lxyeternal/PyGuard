  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation and dynamic execution of encoded payloads, which are typical indicators of malicious or backdoored software. While explicit malicious payloads are not directly visible, the pattern and techniques used are highly suspicious and warrant caution. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent and justified, and the package should be treated as potentially malicious until further deobfuscation and analysis confirm safety."
