  "sinks": "- Execution of dynamically decoded code with exec() which may execute arbitrary code.\n- Reading files from disk, potentially exposing data.\n- Regular expression matching on content that might be manipulated.",
  "flows": "- Base64 encoded strings decode to code that imports modules, makes network requests, and executes code.\n- The dynamically executed code could read or execute arbitrary code at runtime.\n- Version extraction functions read files and parse version info, which are benign but can be manipulated if files are malicious.",
  "anomalies": "- Base64 encoded strings that are decoded and executed dynamically, which can be used to hide malicious code.\n- Use of exec() with decoded code poses a high security risk.\n- Presence of seemingly random variable names and multiple decoding-execution cycles to obfuscate behavior.\n- The code includes functions that read files and extract version strings, which could be exploited if the input files are compromised.",
  "analysis": "The script starts with standard imports and a variable assignment, then executes base64-encoded code decoded at runtime twice, each time running exec() on the decoded string. These decoded strings include code that imports modules, makes network requests to external URLs, and executes code from the network, indicating potential malicious activity. The code also contains functions to read files and extract version strings, which are typical in setup scripts but could be manipulated if the filesystem is compromised. The heavy use of dynamic code execution, especially with code fetched from encoded strings, is suspicious and suggests an attempt to hide malicious behavior or maintain obfuscation. The overall structure resembles a malicious or backdoored setup script that could run arbitrary code during installation or execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits obfuscated behavior via multiple layers of base64 decoding and execution of dynamically fetched code, including network requests and arbitrary code execution. These behaviors are characteristic of malicious or compromised package scripts. The combination of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and network activity indicates a high likelihood of malicious intent. It should be considered unsafe for use or distribution.",
