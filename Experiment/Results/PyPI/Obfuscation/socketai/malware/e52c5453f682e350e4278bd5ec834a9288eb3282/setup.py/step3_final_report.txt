{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script that uses base64-encoded strings decoded and executed dynamically, with functions to read files and extract version info. Its purpose appears to be to set up a Python package, but the heavy obfuscation and dynamic execution suggest potential malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Base64-encoded strings decoded and executed via exec(); file reading functions that parse version info from files.",
  "sinks": "exec() calls on decoded code; file reads for version extraction.",
  "flows": "Base64 strings decoded and passed to exec(), executing potentially malicious code; file reading functions used to obtain version info, possibly manipulated.",
  "anomalies": "Multiple exec() calls on base64-decoded payloads; heavily obfuscated variable names; embedded base64 strings that decode to code; no validation or sanitization; repeated pattern of decoding and executing code.",
  "analysis": "The script decodes base64-encoded strings and executes them with exec(), which is a common obfuscation technique in malicious code. The variable names are nonsensical, and the functions for reading files and extracting version info could be exploited if the files are malicious. The pattern suggests concealment of malicious payloads, possibly involving network activity or system modifications. Without deobfuscating the payloads, certainty is limited, but the pattern strongly indicates malicious intent. The high obfuscation scores (around 0.9) and malware scores (~0.75) are justified given these behaviors. The overall security risk is high (~0.8), as the code could execute harmful actions during installation or runtime.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation and dynamic execution of encoded payloads, which are typical indicators of malicious or backdoored software. While explicit malicious payloads are not directly visible, the pattern and techniques used are highly suspicious and warrant caution. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent and justified, and the package should be treated as potentially malicious until further deobfuscation and analysis confirm safety.",
