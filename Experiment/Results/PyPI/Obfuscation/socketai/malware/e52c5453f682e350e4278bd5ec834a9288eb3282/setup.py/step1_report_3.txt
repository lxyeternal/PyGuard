  "purpose": "The script appears to set up a Python package for distribution, including dynamic version extraction and package metadata configuration.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, os, re; base64-encoded strings decoded and executed; file reading via yeQJDpxpXocpXNvLLcDXZTkAsltGXClT function; version extraction via regex.",
  "sinks": "exec calls with dynamically decoded base64 content; file reading functions; regex matching and string extraction.",
  "flows": "Base64 decoded strings are executed via exec, which could run arbitrary code. The version extraction functions read files and parse content, but do not execute untrusted code directly.",
  "anomalies": "Repeated execution of dynamically decoded base64 strings which could conceal malicious code; the presence of eval/exec on base64 data; obfuscated or dynamic code execution patterns; no clear comments or documentation about the intent of executed code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries but then decodes base64-encoded strings that are executed with exec. The decoded content may contain additional malicious code, such as network calls or system modifications. The version extraction functions parse files for version info but are not inherently malicious. However, the repeated pattern of decoding and executing base64 strings, especially when the content is not directly inspectable, is suspicious. These techniques are often used to hide malicious payloads. The setup configuration itself appears typical but is tainted by the obfuscated code execution pattern. Without deobfuscating the base64 content, it is not possible to confirm the intent, but the pattern suggests potential malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains obfuscated code that executes dynamically decoded base64 strings, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. The pattern of hiding code in encoded strings and executing it at runtime indicates possible malicious intent, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or other harmful activities. The setup code itself appears standard but is likely compromised or designed to conceal malicious operations.",
