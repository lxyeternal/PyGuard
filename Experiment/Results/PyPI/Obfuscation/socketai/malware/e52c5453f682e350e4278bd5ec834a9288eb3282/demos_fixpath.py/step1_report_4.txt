  "purpose": "The code modifies the Python module search path to include the parent directory of the current script.",
  "sources": "Reading __file__ for current script location, using os.path functions to determine directory paths.",
  "sinks": "sys.path.insert for modifying module search path.",
  "flows": "The script takes the current file path (__file__), computes its parent directory, and adds it to sys.path, affecting module import resolution.",
  "anomalies": "The variable name 'RrVgezDAPKKJkmRDqMTMuJgAhTtwLnso' appears obfuscated or randomly generated, which could be suspicious, but it is only used as a variable name for the path.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a path to the parent directory of the current script and prepends it to sys.path, enabling modules in that directory to be imported more easily. This pattern is common in package or module setup. The variable name is unusual but not inherently malicious. No external data sources or untrusted input are used. The code does not contain any network calls, data exfiltration, or hidden behaviors. It simply adjusts the import path.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and performs a standard operation of adjusting module import paths. There are no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
