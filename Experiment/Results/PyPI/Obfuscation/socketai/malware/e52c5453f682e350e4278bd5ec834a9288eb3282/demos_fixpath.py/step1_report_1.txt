  "purpose": "Modify the Python module search path to include the parent directory of the current file.",
  "sources": "Reading the __file__ variable to determine the current script location; constructing a normalized path to the parent directory.",
  "sinks": "sys.path.insert to modify the module search path.",
  "flows": "Reading __file__ -> path construction -> sys.path modification.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code structures; the code is straightforward and typical for adjusting module import paths.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically adds the parent directory of the current script to sys.path, a common practice to enable relative imports from sibling modules. It uses standard os.path functions and modifies sys.path without involving any untrusted data or network activity. There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior. The code does not read input from external sources or perform any sensitive operations. It simply prepares the environment for module importing.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard path adjustment to facilitate module imports; there are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
