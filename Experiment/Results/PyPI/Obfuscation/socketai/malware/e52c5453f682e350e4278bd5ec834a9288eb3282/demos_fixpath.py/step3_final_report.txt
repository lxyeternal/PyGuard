  "purpose": "Adjusts sys.path to include the parent directory of the current script for module import resolution.",
  "sources": "Reads the __file__ variable to determine the script's directory.",
  "sinks": "Modifies sys.path by inserting a directory path; no untrusted data flow or external data sources involved.",
  "flows": "Source (__file__) -> Path construction -> sys.path.insert(0, ...)",
  "anomalies": "Use of an obfuscated or randomly generated variable name for the path variable.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard operation of adding the parent directory to sys.path to facilitate module imports. The variable name used is obfuscated, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No network activity, data exfiltration, or dynamic code execution is present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this pattern. The obfuscation of the variable name is noted but does not imply malicious intent. Malware score remains at 0, and risk scores are low, reflecting the benign and standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a common pattern for managing import paths in Python projects. The obfuscated variable name is superficial and does not indicate malicious behavior. No evidence of malware or security risks is present. The overall assessment confirms the code's benign intent, with a very low security risk.",
