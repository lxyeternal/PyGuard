  "conclusion": "The code fragment shows no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The high obfuscation scores warrant caution but do not indicate malicious intent on their own. The malware risk is effectively zero, and the overall security risk remains very low. The scores and reasoning across reports are consistent and appropriate."
