  "purpose": "Import specific functions and variables from internal modules and set a version string.",
  "sources": "Import statements for functions and variables from internal modules, and a string assignment.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; imports are static, and version string is a fixed value.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated or nonsensical function and variable names, which might be intentional for obfuscation or just naming randomness. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code evident. No dynamic execution or external network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several functions and variables with intentionally obscure names from internal modules, possibly to hide their purpose or to obfuscate the code. It also sets a version string. There are no evident data flows, user input handling, or network activity. The obscurity of names alone is not sufficient to conclude malicious intent, but it warrants scrutiny. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity is explicitly present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign module import and variable assignment with obfuscated naming, possibly for internal organization or concealment. There are no signs of malware, malicious activity, or security risks.",
