  "purpose": "Import functions and variables from local modules and define a version string",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (initialise, ansi, ansitowin32)",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no data processing, output, or external communication observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; merely importing functions and setting a variable",
  "anomalies": "Unusual naming of imported functions/variables (e.g., qeuuewjnTPEVjFaOroUYPuCMwErLVvvv) which could suggest obfuscation, but no malicious activity detected",
  "analysis": "The code performs simple imports from local modules with nonsensical, obfuscated-like names and sets a version string. No data manipulation, external calls, or suspicious behavior observed. The naming pattern could be suspicious if part of obfuscation, but there is no direct evidence of malicious intent. The version string is standard and no hardcoded credentials or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign, primarily involving obfuscated imports and a version string declaration. No malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks identified.",
