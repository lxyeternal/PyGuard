  "purpose": "Adjust the module search path to include the parent directory of the current script.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current file's directory (__file__), computes its parent directory, and modifies sys.path.",
  "sinks": "sys.path modification influences module import behavior; no direct sink for untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Input (__file__) → path computation → sys.path insertion.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable name (ySVOtqngFMBNjlvnzJrOArbZpVvHUdIc) instead of a descriptive identifier; no other suspicious activities detected.",
  "analysis": "The code computes the parent directory of the current script and inserts it at the beginning of sys.path, which is a common practice to control module import paths. The variable name is intentionally obfuscated but does not impact functionality. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. The script does not handle untrusted data or execute any code dynamically. Its sole purpose is to set up import paths, which is a benign operation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard path modification snippet with obfuscated variable naming, but it does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks.",
