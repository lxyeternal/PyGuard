  "flows": "Reading __file__ -> Computing path -> Modifying sys.path.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable name; no explicit malicious behavior observed. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code evident.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a normalized path to the parent directory of the current file and prepends it to sys.path, enabling imports from that directory. The variable name used for the path is obfuscated but does not indicate malicious intent. No data exfiltration, network activity, or malicious commands are present. The code's behavior appears to be standard for dynamic path adjustments in Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a typical operation of adjusting the import path to include the parent directory. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security risks based on this fragment.",
