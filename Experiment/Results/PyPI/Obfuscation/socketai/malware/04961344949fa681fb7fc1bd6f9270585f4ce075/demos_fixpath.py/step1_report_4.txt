  "purpose": "This code adjusts the Python module search path to include the parent directory of the current script.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current file path (__file__) and uses os.path functions to determine and manipulate directory paths.",
  "sinks": "The code modifies sys.path by inserting a directory path, which influences module import behavior.",
  "flows": "The script computes a normalized parent directory path from __file__ and inserts it into sys.path, affecting module resolution for subsequent imports.",
  "anomalies": "The variable name ySVOtqngFMBNjlvnzJrOArbZpVvHUdIc is obfuscated, but the operations performed are standard and benign. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys and os.path modules, then constructs a normalized path to the parent directory of the current script using __file__, dirname, join, and normpath. It then inserts this directory at the beginning of sys.path. These steps are typical for adjusting module import paths, especially in complex project structures. There is no use of dynamic code execution, network communication, or sensitive data handling. The obfuscated variable name may suggest an attempt to hide intent, but the operations themselves are standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet performs a common operation of modifying sys.path to include a parent directory, which is generally safe and used for package/module resolution. There is no evidence of malicious intent or suspicious activity.",
