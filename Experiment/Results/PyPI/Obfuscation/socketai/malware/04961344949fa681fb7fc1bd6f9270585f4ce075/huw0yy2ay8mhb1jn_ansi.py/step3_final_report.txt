{
  "purpose": "The code generates ANSI escape sequences for terminal styling and control, heavily obfuscated with complex class hierarchies and dynamic attribute assignments.",
  "sources": "Functions creating escape sequences, class attribute definitions, and method parameters used in escape sequence generation.",
  "sinks": "Terminal output manipulation via escape sequences, potentially affecting terminal display or concealment.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources; functions produce escape sequences based on parameters, with no external input or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of variable and class names, layered class inheritance, dynamic attribute setting, and use of escape sequences for terminal control.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs escape sequences with parameters, assigns them to class attributes, and manipulates terminal output. No network, file, or external data interactions are present. The obfuscation suggests an intent to conceal, but the core functionality appears to be terminal styling or control. No malicious payloads, data exfiltration, or system modifications are evident. The obfuscation could be exploited for malicious concealment, but in its current form, it remains benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated terminal control sequence generators with no active malicious behavior detected. The high obfuscation and potential for misuse justify cautious scoring but do not confirm malware presence.",
