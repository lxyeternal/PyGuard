  "conclusion": "The code is primarily a terminal output management library with obfuscation and environment-aware features. While no direct malicious activity is evident, its structure and external dependencies warrant cautious review. The malware score is set at 0.3, obfuscation at 0.9, and overall security risk at 0.6, reflecting moderate suspicion due to obfuscation and potential external system interactions."
