{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be a setup configuration script for a Python package, handling package metadata and version extraction.",
  "sources": "Reading version string from a file via 'LeygVXMEsjksymWALzWEbCumAuduuDOZ' function; importing setup functions; reading files from the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly writes or transmits data; no network or data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "The version string extraction flows from reading a file to pattern matching; setup configuration flows from reading package info.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of an obfuscated variable 'RKQFZvJnMIumEpRSLlDxxwAGIvpprZpC' assigned a seemingly random string; the regex pattern is complex but standard; no obvious malicious payloads or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup tasks: importing modules, reading a version string from a file, and configuring package metadata. The obfuscated variable may indicate an attempt to hide or complicate code analysis but does not inherently signify malicious intent. The regex pattern extracts version info, which is typical for setup scripts. No network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration is present. The code relies on standard library functions and well-known setup practices.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a conventional Python package setup configuration with minor obfuscation that does not appear malicious. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The obfuscation is superficial and likely intended to obscure the code’s simplicity rather than hide malicious intent.",
