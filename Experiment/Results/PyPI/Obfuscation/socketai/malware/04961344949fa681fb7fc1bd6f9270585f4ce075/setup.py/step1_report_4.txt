{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package with specific metadata and includes functions to read file contents and extract version information from a source file.",
  "sources": "File reading functions (LeygVXMEsjksymWALzWEbCumAuduuDOZ, QhIrzmJWLNUqtmiljdsEBXXHbnkhifqX), and the setup script reading from __file__",
  "sinks": "The setup() function uses the version extracted from a source file, but no other sink operations or data leaks are evident",
  "flows": "The version extraction function reads a file's content, searches for a version string pattern, and supplies this to setup()",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated or nonsensical variable names (e.g., RKQFZvJnMIumEpRSLlDxxwAGIvpprZpC), which may suggest code hiding or obfuscation. The version extraction pattern looks for a variable assignment with a string but no other suspicious code is evident. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code is found.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs package setup operations with functions to read file contents and extract version info via regex. The variable names are obfuscated, but the logic appears straightforward and benign. There are no indications of malicious activities such as network operations, data exfiltration, or malicious backdoors. The obfuscation could be intended to hide the version string extraction pattern, but it does not imply malicious intent. Overall, the code performs standard setup tasks with some obfuscated variable names.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with obfuscated variable names, designed to read a version string from a source file. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The obfuscation may be for concealment but does not seem malicious.",
