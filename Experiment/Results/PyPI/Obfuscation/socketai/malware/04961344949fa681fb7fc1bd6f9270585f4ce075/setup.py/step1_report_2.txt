{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for packaging a Python project, including functions for reading file contents and extracting version information from a source file.",
  "sources": "Reading file contents using open() in LeygVXMEsjksymWALzWEbCumAuduuDOZ, extracting version string with regex in TdBPfZwKsrNOIsXIFqJuEuPyIYFTrznp",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data influences system behavior or leaks, such as network or filesystem operations beyond reading local files",
  "flows": "File content is read from disk, then version string is extracted via regex from that content; no external data or untrusted sources are used",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variable names and a hard-coded string 'huw0yy2ay8mhb1jn' that appears arbitrary; no malicious code like network connections, eval, or system commands",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical Python setup configuration with functions to read a file and parse a version string using regex. It conditionally imports setup tools, which is standard. The hard-coded string 'RKQFZvJnMIumEpRSLlDxxwAGIvpprZpC' seems unused and arbitrary, potentially obfuscated or placeholder. The regex searches for a line defining a version variable, which is a common pattern. No code executes external commands, network activity, or sensitive data handling. The overall structure is consistent with legitimate package setup scripts. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with obfuscated variable names but no malicious or suspicious behavior. The functions serve common purposes, and no harmful actions are evident.",
