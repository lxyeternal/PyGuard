  "purpose": "This code is a setup.py script for packaging a Python project, including functions to read files and extract version info via regex.",
  "sources": "File reading functions and regex pattern for version extraction",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external system interactions are present",
  "flows": "File content read -> regex search for version string",
  "anomalies": "Presence of an obfuscated variable 'RKQFZvJnMIumEpRSLlDxxwAGIvpprZpC' assigned a random string but unused; superficial obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup tasks with superficial obfuscation through variable names and an unused random string. No malicious payloads, network activity, or data leaks are detected. The regex pattern is typical for version extraction. The obfuscation does not conceal malicious intent, and the code relies on well-known libraries. The unused variable appears to be a red herring, not impacting functionality or security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with superficial obfuscation. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. The obfuscation is superficial and does not indicate malicious intent. The overall security risk is negligible.",
