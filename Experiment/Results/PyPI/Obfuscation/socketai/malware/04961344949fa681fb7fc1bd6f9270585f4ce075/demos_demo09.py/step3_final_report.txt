  "purpose": "CLI utility for styling terminal output using colorama with obfuscated code and dynamic attribute access.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments for color, background, style, and text; dynamic access to module __dict__ for style codes.",
  "sinks": "Concatenation of style codes and text for output; no direct data leaks or malicious sinks detected.",
  "flows": "User inputs -> dynamic attribute access -> style code concatenation -> print output.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and module names; dynamic attribute access via __dict__[key.upper()]; complex string concatenation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a stylized CLI for terminal text styling, heavily obfuscated but functionally benign. No evidence of malicious payloads, network activity, or system modification. The dynamic attribute access could be exploited if inputs are malicious, but in this context, it appears to serve styling purposes. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script functions as a terminal styling utility with obfuscated code. Static analysis shows no active malicious behavior, but obfuscation warrants caution. Malware score is low (~0.2), obfuscation is high (~0.8), and overall security risk is moderate (~0.3). It should be used with awareness of its obfuscation but is unlikely to be malicious in its current form.",
