  "conclusion": "The script functions as a terminal styling utility with obfuscated code. Static analysis shows no active malicious behavior, but obfuscation warrants caution. Malware score is low (~0.2), obfuscation is high (~0.8), and overall security risk is moderate (~0.3). It should be used with awareness of its obfuscation but is unlikely to be malicious in its current form."
