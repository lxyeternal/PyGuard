  "conclusion": "The code exhibits strong indicators of obfuscation and malicious payload delivery, primarily through the use of base64 decoding and dynamic execution. While the console management functions are legitimate, their combination with obfuscated code execution raises significant security concerns. The overall assessment indicates a high probability of malicious intent, warranting further analysis of the decoded payload before deployment or use."
