      "conclusion": "The code is primarily a Windows console manipulation utility with significant obfuscation. No malicious activity or payloads are evident. The high obfuscation suggests potential misuse, but in isolation, the code appears benign. The overall security risk is low, with a slight concern due to obfuscation and system API interaction."

      "conclusion": "The code is primarily a terminal output management library with obfuscation and environment-aware features. While no direct malicious activity is evident, its structure and external dependencies warrant cautious review. The malware score is set at 0.3, obfuscation at 0.9, and overall security risk at 0.6, reflecting moderate suspicion due to obfuscation and potential external system interactions."

      "conclusion": "The code fragment shows no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The high obfuscation scores warrant caution but do not indicate malicious intent on their own. The malware risk is effectively zero, and the overall security risk remains very low. The scores and reasoning across reports are consistent and appropriate."

      "conclusion": "The code is an obfuscated utility for redirecting and managing output streams, with no evidence of malicious behavior. While the obfuscation raises suspicion, there are no signs of malware, data theft, or sabotage. The security risk is low, but caution is advised due to the obfuscation. The malware score is set to 0.1 to reflect the suspicion without evidence, and the obfuscation score remains high. Overall, the code appears benign but warrants monitoring if used in sensitive contexts."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits strong indicators of obfuscation and malicious payload delivery, primarily through the use of base64 decoding and dynamic execution. While the console management functions are legitimate, their combination with obfuscated code execution raises significant security concerns. The overall assessment indicates a high probability of malicious intent, warranting further analysis of the decoded payload before deployment or use."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits significant obfuscation but lacks concrete evidence of malicious activity. It should be flagged for further review due to obfuscation concerns but is not actively malicious. The current scores are appropriate; malware score should remain low, obfuscation high, and risk moderate, reflecting suspicion without confirmed threat."

Malware score is low (~0.2), obfuscation is high (~0.8), and overall security risk is moderate (~0.3). It should be used with awareness of its obfuscation but is unlikely to be malicious in its current form."

The obfuscation is minimal and likely intended to hide the variable name but does not indicate malicious intent. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score is zero."
