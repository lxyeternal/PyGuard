  "conclusion": "The code exhibits significant obfuscation but lacks concrete evidence of malicious activity. It should be flagged for further review due to obfuscation concerns but is not actively malicious. The current scores are appropriate; malware score should remain low, obfuscation high, and risk moderate, reflecting suspicion without confirmed threat."
