{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple Python script that performs basic data processing or computation, with no explicit indication of malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input is likely read from function parameters, user input via input() calls, or environment variables; however, the code does not explicitly show data input sources.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include print statements, file operations, network calls, or executing system commands, but none are explicitly present in the code provided.",
  "flows": "There are no clear source-to-sink data flows in the visible code; the logic seems straightforward and internal.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are observed. No backdoors or suspicious functions are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code lacks any complex or suspicious patterns. It does not perform network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration. Usage of third-party libraries is not suspicious by itself. The structure and format are straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious constructs. Given the absence of external data handling or dangerous functions, there are no evident security issues or malicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign script performing standard data processing. Confidence in this assessment is high.",
