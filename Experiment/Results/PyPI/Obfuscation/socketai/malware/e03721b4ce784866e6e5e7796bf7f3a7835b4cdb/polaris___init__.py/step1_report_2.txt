{
  "purpose": "This code imports all symbols from a module named 'api' and sets the package version to '1.66'.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .api import *",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or untrusted data handling present in the code",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis needed as the code does not process input or data beyond import and version assignment",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' can be considered an anomaly as it obscures imported symbols and can introduce hidden behaviors; no other anomalies detected",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing all contents from a local module 'api' and defining a version string. The use of 'import *' could potentially hide malicious or unintended behavior in the imported module, but this code alone does not demonstrate malicious intent. No input, no data processing, and no suspicious side-effects are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself appears benign; the main concern lies in the imported 'api' module. The use of 'import *' can hide imported symbols, which could be risky if the module contains malicious code, but this cannot be determined from this snippet alone.",
