{
  "purpose": "The code imports all symbols from a module named 'api' and sets a version string for the package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .api import *",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or sensitive operations are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows are observable in this minimal code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a wildcard import ('*') can be considered suspicious as it obscures which symbols are imported and can potentially introduce malicious or unintended code. The rest of the code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a relative import from a local module named 'api' and defines a version string. The import '*'' can sometimes be used to hide malicious or unintended symbols, but with only this line, there is no direct evidence of malicious intent. The code is minimal and does not include any network activity, data handling, or obfuscated constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is minimal and does not demonstrate malicious behavior. The only concern is the use of wildcard import, which can be risky if the imported module contains malicious code. There are no signs of malware or malicious intent in this code fragment.",
