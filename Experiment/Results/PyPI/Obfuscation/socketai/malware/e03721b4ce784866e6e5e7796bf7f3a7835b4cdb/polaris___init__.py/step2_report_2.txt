  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code snippet is minimal: a relative import from `.api` and a version string assignment.\n- No data flows, network activity, or input handling are present.\n- The primary concern raised is the use of `import *`, which can obscure imported symbols and potentially hide malicious code if the imported module is compromised.\n- All reports agree that the code itself appears benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks beyond the potential risks associated with wildcard imports.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Discrepancies:\n\n- **Code correctness:** All reports correctly identify that the code performs a relative import from `.api` and sets a version string. No issues are found in the actual code logic.\n- **Malicious intent:** No evidence of malware, malicious code, or obfuscation is present.\n- **Use of `import *`:** Recognized as a potential risk because it can hide imported symbols, but not inherently malicious.\n\n### Scoring analysis:\n\n- **Malware score:** Consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Security risk score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting a minor concern mainly due to `import *`.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The scores seem reasonable given the minimal code snippet and the consensus that no malicious behavior is demonstrated.\n- The confidence levels are high (0.6 to 0.9), which is appropriate considering the simplicity of the code.\n- The primary concern is the use of `import *`, which is generally discouraged but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on all reports and analysis, I estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1 to 0.2** — minor concern mainly due to wildcard import, but overall low risk.\n\n**My reasoned final scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, with the only caveat being the use of `import *`, which is a style concern rather than a security threat. No evidence suggests malicious intent or behavior in this fragment.",
