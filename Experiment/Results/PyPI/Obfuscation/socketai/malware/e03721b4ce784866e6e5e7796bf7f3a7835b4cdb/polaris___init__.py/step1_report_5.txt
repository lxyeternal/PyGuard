  "purpose": "Import all contents from the local 'api' module and define the package version.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .api import *",
  "sinks": "None identified explicitly in this code snippet",
  "flows": "Data flows from the imported 'api' module into the current namespace; no untrusted data sources or sinks are evident",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' can obscure which functions or variables are brought into scope, but this alone is not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code imports everything from a local module 'api' and sets a version string. There are no visible data inputs, network operations, or suspicious behavior. The use of 'import *' is generally discouraged but does not indicate malicious intent by itself. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code is present. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard module setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks based on this fragment. The only concern is the use of 'import *', which may lead to namespace pollution but not maliciousness.",
