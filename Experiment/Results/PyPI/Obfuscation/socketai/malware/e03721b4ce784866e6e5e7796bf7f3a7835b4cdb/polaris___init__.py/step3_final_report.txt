  "purpose": "Minimal Python module with a relative import from .api and a version string.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from .api import *' and the version assignment '__version__ = \"1.66\"'.",
  "sinks": "Potential namespace pollution from 'import *', but no actual data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "The import statement brings all symbols from the 'api' module into the namespace; no data flow or external data handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' which can obscure symbol origins; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a relative import from a local module 'api' using a wildcard, which is discouraged but not inherently malicious. No network activity, data leaks, or obfuscated code are present. The primary concern is namespace pollution, but given the minimal context, there is no evidence of malicious intent. The scores assigned across reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with a minor stylistic concern regarding 'import *'. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The risk level is low, and the malware score is correctly set to 0.",
