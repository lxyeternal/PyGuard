{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from a local module named 'api' and sets a version string for the package.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from .api import *' reads code from a local module; the '__version__' assignment sets a version string.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows that could lead to data leaks or security issues are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code merely imports and defines a version.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' can obscure which functions or variables are imported, but it is not inherently malicious; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward import of all contents from a local module and assigns a version number. There are no inputs, outputs, or execution of untrusted data. The import style is not recommended for clarity but is not malicious. No suspicious code, data leaks, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The use of 'import *' is discouraged but not malicious in this context.",
