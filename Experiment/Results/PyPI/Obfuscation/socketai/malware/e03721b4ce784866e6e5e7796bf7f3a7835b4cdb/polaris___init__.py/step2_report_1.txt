  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the accuracy of their assessments, scores, and conclusions.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All snippets are minimal, involving only a relative import from a local 'api' module and setting a version string.\n- The primary concern raised across reports is the use of `import *`, which can obscure imported symbols and potentially hide malicious code if the 'api' module is compromised.\n- No evidence of malicious activity, obfuscated code, or data leaks is present in any of these snippets.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Evaluations:\n\n#### 1. **Report 1**\n- **Issue Present?**  \n  Yes, the code matches the snippet: `from .api import *` and version assignment.\n- **Errors/Flaws?**  \n  The report correctly notes the risk of wildcard import but rightly states no malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Scores?**  \n  Malware: 0 (correct)  \n  Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n  SecurityRisk: 0.2 seems reasonable given the wildcard import concern, but perhaps slightly high for such minimal code.\n- **Justification for risk score > 0.5?**  \n  Not applicable; the score is 0.2, which is reasonable.\n- **Malware score?**  \n  Correctly 0; no malware detected.\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  The analysis is sound; the only concern is the import style, not maliciousness.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. **Report 2**\n- **Issue Present?**  \n  Yes, matches the code: `from .api import *`.\n- **Errors/Flaws?**  \n  Same as above; the concern about `import *` is valid but no malicious activity is demonstrated.\n- **Scores?**  \n  Malware: 0 (correct)  \n  Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n  SecurityRisk: 0.2, consistent with the previous report.\n- **Justification for risk > 0.5?**  \n  Not applicable.\n- **Malware score?**  \n  Correct.\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  Valid assessment; no malicious intent detected.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. **Report 3**\n- **Issue Present?**  \n  Yes, the code matches the snippet.\n- **Errors/Flaws?**  \n  Same observations; the wildcard import is discouraged but not malicious.\n- **Scores?**  \n  Malware: 0 (correct)  \n  Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n  SecurityRisk: 0.1 — slightly lower, which is reasonable given the minimal code.\n- **Justification for risk > 0.5?**  \n  Not applicable.\n- **Malware score?**  \n  Correct.\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  Appropriate; no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. **Report 4**\n- **Issue Present?**  \n  Yes, matches the code.\n- **Errors/Flaws?**  \n  Same as previous; the concern about `import *` is valid but no malicious activity.\n- **Scores?**  \n  Malware: 0 (correct)  \n  Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n  SecurityRisk: 0.1 — consistent with minimal risk.\n- **Justification for risk > 0.5?**  \n  No.\n- **Malware score?**  \n  Correct.\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  Valid; no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. **Report 5**\n- **Issue Present?**  \n  Yes, matches the code.\n- **Errors/Flaws?**  \n  Same as above; the main concern is the use of `import *`.\n- **Scores?**  \n  Malware: 0 (correct)  \n  Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n  SecurityRisk: 0.2 — acceptable given the context.\n- **Justification for risk > 0.5?**  \n  No.\n- **Malware score?**  \n  Correct.\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  Appropriate assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify the code snippet.\n- **Malware and obfuscation scores:** All are correctly set to 0, as there's no evidence of malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Security risk scores:** Slightly elevated due to the use of `import *`, but given the minimal context, these are acceptable. They could be marginally lowered to 0.1–0.2 for consistency, but the current values are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Final overall assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is straightforward and not obfuscated.  \n**Risk score:** **0.1–0.2** — the main concern is the use of `import *`, which is a style issue rather than a security flaw.\n\n**Note:** The reports are consistent and accurate in their reasoning. No adjustments needed unless the context of the 'api' module suggests malicious intent, which isn't indicated here.\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion, I agree with the current scores and assessments.**",
