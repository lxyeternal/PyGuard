  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**Code Under Review:**\n```python\nfrom .api import *\n\n__version__ = '1.66'\n```\n\n---\n\n### **General Observations:**\n- The code performs a relative import from a local module `api` using a wildcard (`*`).\n- It sets a version string.\n- There are no evident sinks, data flows, or input handling.\n- The code is minimal, with no network activity, obfuscated code, or explicit malicious operations.\n\n---\n\n### **Analysis of Each Report:**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Import all symbols from `api`, set version.\n- **Concerns:** Use of `import *` can hide malicious symbols.\n- **Assessment:** No direct evidence of malicious behavior; the concern is the potential risk if `api` contains malicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2 seem reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid. The score aligns with the minimal concern about `import *`.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Concerns:** Same as above.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity evident; the main issue is the use of `import *`.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2 appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Concerns:** Same as above.\n- **Assessment:** Benign; the use of `import *` is discouraged but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.1 reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Same.\n- **Concerns:** Potential data leaks if `api` handles untrusted data, but not evident here.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious activity; the concern about data leaks is speculative without further context.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.1 fit.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Same.\n- **Concerns:** Same as above.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity; the only concern is namespace pollution.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2 acceptable.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Justification:**\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly varied but generally low, reflecting the concern about `import *` and potential hidden issues in `api`. The highest is 0.2, which seems appropriate given the minimal code.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Adjustments & Final Estimations:**\n\n- The scores are generally reasonable. Given the minimal code and lack of evidence, I would agree with the current scores.\n- The main concern is the use of `import *`, which can be risky if `api` contains malicious code. However, without further context, this is only a potential risk, not an active threat.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk Score:** Considering the wildcard import, a slightly higher score could be justified, but 0.2 remains reasonable for such minimal code.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- **Confirmed issues:** No evidence of malicious code.\n- **Errors or flaws in reasoning:** None significant; the concern about `import *` is valid but not indicative of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Appropriately assigned; no changes necessary.\n- **Overall estimate:**  \n  - **Malware:** 0  \n  - **Obfuscated:** 0  \n  - **Risk:** 0.2 (slightly conservative, but acceptable)\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The security risk primarily hinges on the contents of the `api` module, which is outside the scope of this snippet. The current scoring appropriately reflects that uncertainty.",
