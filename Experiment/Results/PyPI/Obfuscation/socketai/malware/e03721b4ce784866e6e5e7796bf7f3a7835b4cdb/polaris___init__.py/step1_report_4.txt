{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from the local 'api' module and sets a version string for the package.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .api import *",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks or untrusted data flow could occur if the imported module handles untrusted input, but the import itself is not a sink.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'api' module into the current namespace when imported, but no direct data flow or untrusted input processing is visible in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' can hide imported content and is discouraged, but it does not necessarily indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of an import statement and a version assignment. The import statement does not specify any particular functions or variables, which may obscure imported contents. The version string is straightforward. No signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, credential handling, or obfuscation, are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet appears benign, performing a standard import and version assignment. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security risks based on this fragment alone.",
