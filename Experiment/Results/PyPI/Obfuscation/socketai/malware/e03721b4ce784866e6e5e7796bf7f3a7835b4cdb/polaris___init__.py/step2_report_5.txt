  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the reported issues, the reasoning, and the assigned scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All snippets are very similar: they perform a relative import from a local 'api' module and define a version string.\n- The main concern raised across reports is the use of `import *`, which can obscure imported symbols and potentially hide malicious or unintended code.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, network activity, data handling, or obfuscation is present in any snippet.\n- The confidence levels are generally high, reflecting that these are minimal, straightforward snippets.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and evaluations:\n\n**1. Presence of issues in the code:**\n- The code itself is simple and does not contain any malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation.\n- The only questionable aspect is the use of `import *`, which is discouraged but not inherently malicious.\n\n**2. Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**\n- The reports correctly identify the use of `import *` as a potential risk but correctly note that it does not necessarily indicate malicious intent.\n- They appropriately conclude that, based on this fragment alone, there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n\n**3. Scores review:**\n- `malware`: all reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code.\n- `obfuscated`: all assign 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- `securityRisk`: mostly low (0.1 to 0.2), which is reasonable given the minimal code and no evident vulnerabilities.\n- `confidence`: ranges from 0.6 to 0.9, reflecting the certainty that the code is benign.\n\n**4. Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n- None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.2, which is appropriate.\n- The only concern is the use of `import *`, which can be risky if the imported module is malicious, but there's no evidence here.\n\n**5. Malware score justification:**\n- Since there's no evidence of malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation, a malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n**6. Challenging assumptions:**\n- The assumption that `import *` could hide malicious code is valid, but without evidence, it remains a theoretical concern.\n- The reports do not overstate the risk; they acknowledge the potential but do not assign high scores.\n\n**7. Consistency of scores:**\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis and the minimal nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Overall, I agree with the reports' conclusions and scores.** The only potential adjustment could be to emphasize that the use of `import *` is discouraged because it can lead to namespace pollution and obscure code, but it does not imply malicious intent.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (low, mainly due to `import *` usage)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The code snippets are benign.\n- The main concern is the use of `import *`, which is a stylistic and potential security concern but not malicious.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No significant changes needed. The code is minimal, and the reports correctly identify the potential concern without overstating the risk.",
