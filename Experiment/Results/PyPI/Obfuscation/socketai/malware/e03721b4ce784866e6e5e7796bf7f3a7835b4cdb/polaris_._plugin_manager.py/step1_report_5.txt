  "sources": "No input or data reading functions or external data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sink points where untrusted data is processed or could cause harm.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; this is static metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of quarantine attributes and metadata, which are common on Mac OS X files. No suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The data shown is a file attribute block indicating quarantine status (e.g., 'com.apple.quarantine') with associated metadata like flags and codes. It does not contain executable code, scripts, or logic. No behavior indicative of malware or malicious intent is present. This appears to be standard OS metadata, not malicious payload.",
  "conclusion": "The provided data is a Mac OS X file quarantine attribute block. It does not contain executable code, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. It is a normal part of Mac file metadata, with no security concerns.",
