{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, responsible for reading version information and setting up package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads the version from a file, executes a subprocess to retrieve a version, collects system information via platform and os modules, and makes an HTTP GET request with encoded system data.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get() call sends system information to an external IP address. The subprocess.Popen() call executes a script or command derived from the version file. The code reads local files and executes subprocesses that could potentially run arbitrary commands.",
  "flows": "System information collected via platform and os modules is encoded in base64 and sent over the network via requests.get(). The subprocess.Popen() executes a script or command constructed from the filename 'version', which could be malicious if the file content is malicious.",
  "anomalies": "The code executes a subprocess that runs a file named 'version' derived from replacing '__init__.py' in a path, which may be an attempt to execute arbitrary code. It also sends encoded system data to an external IP address ('http://1.15.77.2/v/...'), which is suspicious. The use of 'ifconfig' command and direct network transmission of data indicates potential data exfiltration. These behaviors are unusual for a standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries and third-party modules. It constructs a path to a 'version' script or file and executes it via subprocess.Popen, which could be malicious if the file contains harmful code. It gathers system information, encodes it, and sends it to a hardcoded IP address, potentially for tracking or exfiltration. The version reading via regex and file parsing seems normal, but the external network communication and subprocess execution are suspicious. The IP address used is external and potentially malicious, and the code’s purpose to send system info indicates privacy concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains suspicious behavior, notably executing an external file derived from a path and transmitting system data to an external IP address, which may be malicious. These behaviors are not typical for a setup script and suggest possible data exfiltration or malicious activity.",
