{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'i4abuctaptjpcb0s' package, intended to define package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from '__init__.py', collects system info via platform and os modules, makes HTTP requests to a remote server, and executes an external script via subprocess.",
  "sinks": "HTTP GET request to an external IP address, subprocess execution of a version script, file read operations.",
  "flows": "Read version info from local file -> gather system info -> send system info encoded in base64 to remote server -> execute version script via subprocess.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes making an HTTP request to a hardcoded IP address possibly for tracking or exfiltration, executing a script called 'version' via subprocess, and collecting extensive system info (node name, uname, current directory, network info). The filename 'version' is derived by replacing '__init__.py' with 'version' but the code executes it without validation, suggesting dynamic execution or obfuscation potential.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a setup script, but it performs additional, potentially malicious activities: it gathers detailed system info and encodes it, then sends it to an external server at IP 1.15.77.2. It also runs a script named 'version' which is derived from a filename path but is executed via subprocess without validation, possibly to run arbitrary code. These actions are suspicious, as they could be used for system profiling, data exfiltration, or executing malicious code. The code does not appear to be obfuscated but does include potentially malicious data collection and external communication.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains malicious indicators: it collects detailed system info, sends it to an external IP address, and executes a script derived from local file paths without validation. These behaviors suggest possible data exfiltration and malicious intent, making this code highly suspicious and potentially dangerous.",
