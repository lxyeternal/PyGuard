{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be a setup or installation script for a Python package, handling version reading and package configuration.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the filesystem (__init__.py), runs subprocess commands, accesses platform info, and makes an HTTP GET request to an external IP address.",
  "sinks": "The code sends data to an external IP address via an HTTP request, which can leak system information.",
  "flows": "System info gathered from platform and subprocess is base64-encoded and sent via a GET request to 'http://1.15.77.2/v/%s'.",
  "anomalies": "The code constructs a request to a suspicious IP address, uses subprocess.Popen without capturing output, and executes a non-standard request to an obscure IP address. Also, 'requests.get' is used to send system info externally, which may be malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports common modules and defines a function to read the package version from '__init__.py'. Instead of directly reading the version, it runs a subprocess to execute a file named 'version' (possibly obfuscated or misused). It gathers system and network info via platform and subprocess, concatenates it, encodes it in base64, and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded IP address, which is suspicious. The setup() function specifies a package with a seemingly random name. The external request and subprocess execution are potential indicators of malicious activity, such as information exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains suspicious behavior: it transmits system information to a hardcoded IP address without clear justification, and executes a subprocess that may be malicious. These actions suggest potential data leakage or malicious intent. The package name appears random and could be used for obfuscation.",
