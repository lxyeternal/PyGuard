  "purpose": "Import and execute a potentially obscured module or object",
  "sources": "The import statement from the current package, and the subsequent execution of the imported object",
  "sinks": "The execution of the imported object, which could potentially run untrusted or malicious code",
  "flows": "Import of 'JSadixCqlbkWYkeaxdqFsleGkdlupADa' -> execution of JSadixCqlbkWYkeaxdqFsleGkdlupADa()",
  "anomalies": "The module name and object are highly obfuscated, consisting of a random string, which is suspicious; no other code or logic present",
  "analysis": "The code imports an object from the current package using a non-descriptive, random string name. It then immediately executes this object as a function. The lack of any other code, comments, or context suggests the code is designed to hide malicious intent. The obfuscated name indicates possible malicious concealment, potentially hiding malicious logic inside the imported object. Without seeing the imported module, it's impossible to definitively assess behavior, but the pattern is suspicious and commonly used to hide malicious code. The code's simplicity and obfuscation raise significant concern for malicious activity, such as executing hidden payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious due to its obfuscated import and immediate execution pattern. It likely aims to hide malicious behavior within the imported module or object. Further investigation of the imported module is necessary, but the current code is potentially malicious.",
