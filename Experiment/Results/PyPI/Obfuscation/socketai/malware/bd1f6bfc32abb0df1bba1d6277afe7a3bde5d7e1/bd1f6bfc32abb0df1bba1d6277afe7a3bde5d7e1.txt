      "conclusion": "The code is malicious, executing remote scripts during installation with obfuscated naming to conceal intent. It poses a severe security threat and should be flagged as malicious. The high scores are justified based on the remote code execution, obfuscation, and hardcoded IP address."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign SSH server with insecure deployment practices. It does not contain malware or obfuscated code but presents a significant security risk if deployed unprotected. The malware score should be 0, the obfuscated score 0, and the overall security risk around 0.65 due to insecure setup."

      "obfuscated": 0.9,
      "confidence": 0.85,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits a suspicious pattern of importing and immediately executing an obfuscated module/object, which is a common indicator of malicious intent. The high obfuscation and execution pattern justify a high malware risk score. Further static or dynamic analysis of the imported module is strongly recommended before deploying or executing this code in production environments."
