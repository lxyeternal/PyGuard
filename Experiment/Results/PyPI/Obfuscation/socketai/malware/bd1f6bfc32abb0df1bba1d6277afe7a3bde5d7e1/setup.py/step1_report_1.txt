{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a setup configuration for a Python package, with a custom installation step that executes a system command.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'os' module (imported at the top) and the 'setup' parameters. The malicious source is the 'os.system' call within the custom install class, which executes a remote script.",
  "sinks": "The 'os.system' call is a sink where untrusted input (remote URL) is executed via bash, leading to potential remote code execution if the URL or command is malicious.",
  "flows": "During package installation, the custom install command triggers 'os.system' to run the 'curl' command piped into 'bash', executing remote code from 'http://34.69.215.243/hi'.",
  "anomalies": "The class name and method names are obfuscated, which is suspicious. The 'os.system' command downloads and executes a script from an external IP address without validation, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The setup parameters are also nonsensical or incomplete (e.g., 'FjwlIqziLyuWLvxOZuiAIyLJdNGeVsIC' and 'WtqCBlfDzJGIfMJWkvAgvRQrjMYTSJqB' are not standard parameters).",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and defines a custom install class with a obfuscated name. During installation, it executes a remote bash script via 'curl' piped into 'bash'. The remote URL is hardcoded and points to an IP address, which is suspicious. The package metadata is nonsensical, indicating possible obfuscation or malicious intent. The script's behavior resembles malware that downloads and executes remote code during package installation, which can compromise the host system. No other benign functionality is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains a malicious behavior: executing remote code during package installation via an obfuscated class and method, with a hardcoded IP address and 'curl' command. The setup configuration itself appears to be intentionally obfuscated or malicious, indicating high suspicion of malware embedded within the package.",
