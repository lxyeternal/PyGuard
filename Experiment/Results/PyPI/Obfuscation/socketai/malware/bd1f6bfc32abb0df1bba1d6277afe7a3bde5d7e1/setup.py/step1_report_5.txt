  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that customizes installation behavior.",
  "sources": "The method xybywbOEiBerhcrshrqnDRqpfHdAReuK reads the installation process and os.system executes a command during installation.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executes a shell command that fetches and executes a script from a remote server, which can be malicious.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom install command runs os.system to download and execute remote code, creating a direct source-to-sink path.",
  "anomalies": "The class name and method name are obfuscated, suggesting an attempt to hide malicious intent. The URL in os.system is an IP address, and the command is designed to silently download and run remote code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools for package setup and defines a custom install class with an obfuscated name. During installation, it executes a shell command that fetches and runs code from an external IP address via curl piped to bash, which is a typical indicator of malicious activity. The setup parameters include a suspicious package name and version, with an odd classifier and a list containing 'paramiko'. The obfuscated class and method names, along with the remote code execution, strongly suggest malicious intent. The code does not perform any legitimate setup functions beyond this suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script contains a malicious payload that downloads and executes remote code during package installation. The obfuscated class and method names, combined with the remote command execution, are clear indicators of malicious activity. The package should not be used or installed.",
