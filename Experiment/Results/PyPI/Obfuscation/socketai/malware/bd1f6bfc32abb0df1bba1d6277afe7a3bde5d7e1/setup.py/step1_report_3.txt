  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup process with a custom install command that executes a remote script via curl and bash.",
  "sources": "The method xybywbOEiBerhcrshrqnDRqpfHdAReuK reads no external input; the code reads package configuration data.",
  "sinks": "os.system call that executes a remote URL fetch and bash execution; this is a high-risk sink.",
  "flows": "The custom install command triggers the os.system call during package installation, executing remote code from http://34.69.215.243/hi.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names; remote code execution during install; use of curl piping directly into bash without validation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class inheriting from setuptools' install. The overridden method xybywbOEiBerhcrshrqnDRqpfHdAReuK executes a system command that fetches a script from a suspicious IP address and executes it via bash. The setup configuration registers this custom command class, which causes the remote code execution at install time. The obfuscated names suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent. The URL points to an IP address, not a domain, indicating suspicious activity. The use of 'curl -s' piped into 'bash' is a common technique for executing remote malicious scripts. No other code or safe fallback is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains a highly suspicious remote code execution during installation, indicating malicious intent or backdoor behavior. The obfuscation and direct remote script execution strongly suggest malware.",
