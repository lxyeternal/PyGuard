  "conclusion": "The code is a benign SSH server with insecure deployment practices. It does not contain malware or obfuscated code but presents a significant security risk if deployed unprotected. The malware score should be 0, the obfuscated score 0, and the overall security risk around 0.65 due to insecure setup."
