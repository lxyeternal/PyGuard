{
  "purpose": "Implements a multi-threaded SSH server that accepts connections, authenticates with any credentials, and provides a simple echo shell interface.",
  "sources": "Socket accept calls, SSH negotiation, user credential input, command input from client.",
  "sinks": "Sending data back to client, logging credentials, accepting commands, closing connections.",
  "flows": "Connection accepted -> SSH negotiation -> Authentication -> Command prompt -> Echo input -> Exit command -> Close connection.",
  "anomalies": "Runtime generation of RSA key, minimal validation, accepting all credentials, logging credentials, no persistent storage or authentication controls.",
  "analysis": "The code creates an SSH server that dynamically generates a 2048-bit RSA key, accepts all incoming SSH connections without proper authentication, and provides a basic shell that echoes commands. It logs connection details and credentials but does not contain any malicious payloads or obfuscated code. The server's insecure configuration poses a security risk but does not constitute malware or sabotage. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present in the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign SSH server with insecure deployment practices. It does not contain malware or obfuscated code but presents a significant security risk if deployed unprotected. The malware score should be 0, the obfuscated score 0, and the overall security risk around 0.65 due to insecure setup.",
