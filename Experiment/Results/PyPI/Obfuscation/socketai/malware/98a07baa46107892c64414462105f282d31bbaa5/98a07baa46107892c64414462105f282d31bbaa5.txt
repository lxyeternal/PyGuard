      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious intent due to the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command triggered under specific filesystem conditions. The silent execution and obfuscation are typical tactics used in malware to evade detection. The overall security risk is high, and the package should be treated as potentially malicious until the encoded command is decoded and analyzed. The scores provided are consistent with this assessment."
