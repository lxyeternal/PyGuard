{
  "purpose": "This code customizes the installation process of a Python package to perform data collection and exfiltration during installation.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser(), file reads (/etc/debconf.conf, /.dockerenv, /root/.wget-hsts)",
  "sinks": "requests.get() and requests.post() functions sending data over network, reading system files and sending their contents to external server",
  "flows": "Hostname, current directory, and username are collected and sent to multiple external URLs; contents of specific system files are read and posted to a remote server",
  "anomalies": "Code uses obfuscated class and function names; sends system info and file contents to external server; reads sensitive system files; no user consent or explicit functionality explained",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that, upon execution, gathers system information such as hostname, current directory, and username. It then makes multiple HTTP GET requests to external domains and posts contents of sensitive files to a remote server, likely for data exfiltration. The use of obfuscated identifiers and reading system files like /etc/debconf.conf, /.dockerenv, and /root/.wget-hsts indicates malicious intent to harvest and transmit sensitive system data without user consent. The code operates silently during package installation, which is a common tactic for malicious supply chain components.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting and exfiltrating system information and sensitive file contents to external servers during package installation. Its obfuscated nature and actions strongly suggest it is intended for malicious purposes, such as data theft or system surveillance.",
