{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to exfiltrate system information and sensitive files during package installation, communicating with suspicious domains, and obfuscating its behavior to evade detection.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser(), reading files (/etc/debconf.conf, /.dockerenv, /root/.wget-hsts), network requests to j0j0.xyz",
  "sinks": "requests.get() and requests.post() calls transmitting data to external servers",
  "flows": "System info and file contents are collected and sent via network requests during installation, indicating data exfiltration",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names, network activity during setup, reading sensitive files, multiple requests to suspicious domains",
  "analysis": "The code defines an obfuscated install class that, during package installation, collects hostname, current directory, and username, then reads sensitive files and exfiltrates their contents via HTTP requests to a suspicious domain. The network activity, combined with obfuscated identifiers and file access, strongly indicates malicious intent. The behavior aligns with typical malware patterns involving data theft and covert communication. The high confidence scores (around 0.9) assigned in reports are justified given the clear exfiltration, suspicious network activity, and obfuscation. The malicious activity during installation poses a significant security risk, warranting high malware and risk scores (approaching 0.95). The obfuscation score is also justified at 0.9 due to the obfuscated class and method names. Overall, the code should be classified as highly malicious, with a malware score of approximately 0.95, obfuscation at 0.9, and security risk at 0.95.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code exhibits clear malicious behavior, including data exfiltration, obfuscation, and network communication with suspicious domains during package installation. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with these behaviors. It should be considered a severe security threat and flagged accordingly.",
