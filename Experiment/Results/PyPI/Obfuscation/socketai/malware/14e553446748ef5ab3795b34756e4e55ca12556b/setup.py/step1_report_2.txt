{
  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to collect system information and exfiltrate specific local files to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Reading hostname, current working directory, username, and local files (/etc/debconf.conf, /.dockerenv, /root/.wget-hsts).",
  "sinks": "Sending collected data to external server via HTTP POST requests; making external GET requests to specific URLs.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, cwd, username) collected during install, then sent via HTTP GET requests; local files are read and their contents are sent via HTTP POST requests to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names; multiple requests to suspicious domains; reading sensitive system files and sending their contents; making network requests during installation, which is unusual behavior; using non-standard parameter names in requests.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that executes during package installation. It collects hostname, current directory, and username. It then makes several HTTP GET requests to possibly malicious domains. It reads sensitive system files (/etc/debconf.conf, /.dockerenv, /root/.wget-hsts) and posts their contents to an external server. The obfuscated class and method names suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent. The repeated requests and file exfiltration indicate malicious behavior aimed at data collection and communication with command and control servers.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior, including data exfiltration of sensitive system files and communication with suspicious domains. It appears designed to gather system info and files during installation and send them externally, which is indicative of malicious activity.",
