  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser(), open('/etc/debconf.conf'), open('/.dockerenv'), open('/root/.wget-hsts')",
  "sinks": "requests.get() and requests.post() calls to external server, reading system files",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, cwd, username) is sent via GET requests; contents of system files are sent via POST requests to https://j0j0.xyz/files/.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names; use of requests to communicate with suspicious domain; reading sensitive files and sending their contents externally; multiple requests to the same domain with different payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, upon installation, gathers system information and reads specific system files. It then exfiltrates this data to a remote server at j0j0.xyz via HTTP GET and POST requests. The class and method names are intentionally obfuscated, suggesting an attempt to hide malicious intent. The code accesses sensitive files such as '/etc/debconf.conf', '/.dockerenv', and '/root/.wget-hsts', which could contain sensitive data. The repeated requests to an external domain and data exfiltration of system files point toward malicious behavior aimed at information theft.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting system information and sensitive files, then exfiltrating them to an external server. The obfuscated naming and network activity strongly suggest an intent to compromise system security and leak data. It is highly malicious and should be considered a security threat.",
