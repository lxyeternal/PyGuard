  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to collect system information and exfiltrate specific system files to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Reading system hostname, current working directory, username, and sensitive system files ('/etc/debconf.conf', '/.dockerenv', '/root/.wget-hsts').",
  "sinks": "Sending collected data via HTTP POST requests to 'https://j0j0.xyz/files/'. Accessing system files and sending their content without user consent.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, cwd, username) -> sent to 'https://j0j0.xyz/11cent' and other URLs; system files ('/etc/debconf.conf', '/.dockerenv', '/root/.wget-hsts') -> POST request to 'https://j0j0.xyz/files/'.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class name and method; multiple requests to suspicious domains; reading and exfiltrating sensitive system files; code runs during installation phase, which is unusual.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that, during installation, collects hostname, current directory, and username, then sends this info to external servers. It also reads sensitive system files and posts their contents to an external URL. The use of obfuscated class/method names, accessing system files like '/etc/debconf.conf', '/.dockerenv', and '/root/.wget-hsts' indicates malicious intent to exfiltrate data. The network requests to 'j0j0.xyz' domains are suspicious and align with malicious exfiltration behavior. There are no legitimate reasons for such actions during package installation, strongly indicating malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains malicious behavior designed to collect system information and sensitive files, then exfiltrate them to a malicious server. The obfuscation and data exfiltration patterns are typical of malware. The package should be considered dangerous and untrusted.",
