It then runs the executable without any checks or user consent. The code uses urllib to fetch remote content, writes it directly to disk, and executes it via subprocess. The approach indicates a high likelihood of malicious intent, especially given the immediate execution of an external binary from an untrusted source, with no validation, verification, or user prompts. The code does not appear obfuscated but employs suspicious practices typical of malware behavior, such as downloading and executing remote payloads.\\n\\nOverall, the code exhibits behaviors consistent with malicious activity, including automatic execution of downloaded binaries, potential persistence, and lack of user awareness or control.\",\n  \"conclusion\": \"The code is highly suspicious and likely malicious. It downloads and executes a remote binary without validation, which poses significant security risks. It resembles typical malware behavior aimed at executing untrusted code on the host system.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.9,\n  \"obfuscated\": 0,\n  \"malware\": 1,\n  \"securityRisk\": 1\n}",
