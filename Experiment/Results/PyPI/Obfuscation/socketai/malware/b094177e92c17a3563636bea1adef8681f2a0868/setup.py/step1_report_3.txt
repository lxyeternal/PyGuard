  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python project using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads package name, version, license type, dependencies, and classifiers from the script variables and functions.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data is executed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Variables are assigned but not used in a harmful manner; the setup() call uses some variables for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names; variables are defined but not used meaningfully, potential obfuscation. No user input, external data, or sensitive information handling observed. The variable names are intentionally obscure, which could be a sign of hiding malicious intent, but no malicious code or behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with highly obfuscated variable names. Variables are assigned values related to package metadata but are not used in a suspicious way beyond standard configuration. No dynamic code execution, network communication, or malicious behavior detected. The obfuscation appears superficial, likely intended to hide the straightforward nature of the setup process. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data handling are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard setup script for a Python package, with obfuscated variable names that do not contribute to any malicious activity. No malicious behavior or security risks identified based on the provided code.",
