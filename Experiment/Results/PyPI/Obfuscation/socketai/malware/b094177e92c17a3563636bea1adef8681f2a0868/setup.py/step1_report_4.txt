  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package distribution.",
  "sources": "Import statement from setuptools; string assignments for version and credentials; setup() function call with package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Import -> Variable assignments -> setup() call.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names (e.g., PVSlxtlXlbbMqXvPACIaUMFxczvPELrw), which appear obfuscated or auto-generated; variables storing 'oauth' and version info without context; no actual code execution or dynamic behavior. No hardcoded credentials or malicious API keys observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools for package setup. It assigns obfuscated variable names to version and potentially credentials, but only 'oauth' is assigned twice. The setup() call uses these variables for package name, version, and content type. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as network access, credential theft, code injection, or data exfiltration. The obfuscated variable names could suggest an attempt to hide intent, but no malicious activity is evident. Overall, the code appears to be a standard, minimal setup script with unusual variable naming, possibly for obfuscation or non-standard code generation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names but does not demonstrate malicious behavior or security risks. No indicators of malware or malicious intent are present.",
