  "purpose": "A standard Python setup script using setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Static variable assignments and the setup() function call; no external input or dynamic data.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, network activity, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; static configuration with no external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names that are nonsensical, which is unusual but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with obfuscated variable names. It does not contain any dynamic code execution, network activity, or payloads. The obfuscation appears superficial, possibly intended to conceal variable purposes but does not introduce malicious behavior. All indicators point to a benign static configuration. The high obfuscation score reflects the variable naming but does not imply malicious intent. No external data handling or malicious functions are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static setup script with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malware, malicious behavior, or supply chain attack. The obfuscation warrants cautious review but does not constitute a security threat in this context.",
