  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package, specifying dependencies and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Read from the 'setup' function call, the version string variable, and the package name.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling; the code only defines package metadata.",
  "flows": "The version string and package name are static; no data flows or untrusted data processing occur.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated package name 'sdrcllwo6t08cq7i' and variable 'OaebiqcuchANLSnlDdhacXYBKvKbktPi' assigned but unused; these obfuscations are suspicious but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal setup script with obfuscated identifiers, which could be an attempt to evade detection. No malicious code, network activity, or data exfiltration is present. The dependencies listed are common packages, which are not inherently malicious but could be misused if the actual package code were malicious. The obfuscation of the package name and variable suggests potential concealment but does not demonstrate malicious intent in this snippet. The malware score is appropriately set to 0, and the low risk score reflects the benign nature of the code. The obfuscation warrants cautious monitoring if further code is provided, but based solely on this, the code appears safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated identifiers, likely intended to hide or disguise the package's purpose. No malicious activity is evident in this snippet. The obfuscation and nonsensical package name are suspicious but not malicious. The dependency list is common and does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the package appears benign, but obfuscation warrants cautious review if further code is examined.",
