{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package with specific dependencies using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads package configuration and dependencies; the variable assignment appears to be arbitrary but does not read external input.",
  "sinks": "setup() function defining package requirements; dependencies are specified but are common packages, not necessarily malicious.",
  "flows": "Code assigns a version string to a variable, then calls setup() with dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "The variable name 'OaebiqcuchANLSnlDdhacXYBKvKbktPi' appears obfuscated or nonsensical, possibly an attempt to hide intent. No direct input or external data reading observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a standard package setup using setuptools. The variable name is unusual but does not affect functionality. Dependencies include popular packages, no suspicious or malicious packages are listed. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior evident. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no evidence of malicious activity or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script for a Python package, with an obfuscated variable name but no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It only specifies package metadata and dependencies.",
