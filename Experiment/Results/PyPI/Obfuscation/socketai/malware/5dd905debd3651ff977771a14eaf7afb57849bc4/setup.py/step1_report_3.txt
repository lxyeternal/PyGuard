  "purpose": "Set up configuration for a Python package distribution, specifying dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it defines static variables and calls setup().",
  "sinks": "The setup() function uses the install_requires list, which specifies external dependencies.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources; dependencies are hardcoded strings.",
  "anomalies": "Variable name 'OaebiqcuchANLSnlDdhacXYBKvKbktPi' is unusual and does not serve a clear purpose; no version control or dynamic code execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setup' and 'find_packages' from setuptools. It defines an oddly named variable with a string '1.0.0' but does not use it, instead passing dependencies directly into setup(). The dependencies listed are 'browser_cookie3', 'discordwebhook', 'robloxpy', and 'requests', which are common third-party packages. The code does not include any user input, environment variables, or dynamic code execution. There are no obfuscated patterns or hidden behaviors. The variable name appears intentionally obfuscated but serves no functional purpose, suggesting possible intent to evade detection or hide purpose, but this alone does not indicate malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard package setup with specified dependencies, with an unusual variable name that does not influence functionality. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code. The dependencies are common, and no dynamic or suspicious actions are present.",
