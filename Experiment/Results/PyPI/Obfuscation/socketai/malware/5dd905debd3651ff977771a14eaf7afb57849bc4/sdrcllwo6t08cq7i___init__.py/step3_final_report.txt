{
  "purpose": "The code extracts Roblox cookies from various browser storage, validates them via Roblox API, retrieves user information, and exfiltrates this data to a specified webhook URL.",
  "sources": "Browser cookie files (firefox, chromium, edge, opera, chrome), environment variables, and system commands.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST requests to a webhook URL containing user cookies and information.",
  "flows": "Cookie files are read -> cookies are extracted -> validated via Roblox API -> user info fetched -> data sent to webhook.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names, hardcoded webhook URL, execution of system commands (`os.system`), silent error handling with empty except blocks, and collection of sensitive cookies without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The script performs cookie harvesting from multiple browsers, searches for '.ROBLOSECURITY' cookies, validates them via Roblox API, retrieves user details such as UserID, username, friends count, account age, creation date, avatar, balance, and premium status. It then exfiltrates this data to a webhook URL, including the sensitive cookie. The code uses obfuscated variable names and executes system commands, indicating malicious intent. Error handling is suppressed, hiding potential issues. The overall pattern is consistent with a cookie stealer designed for unauthorized data collection.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, primarily designed for data exfiltration of Roblox user cookies and personal information. It employs obfuscation and silent error handling to conceal its activity. The activity poses a high security risk, with potential for account hijacking and privacy violations.",
