{
  "purpose": "The script appears to collect Roblox user information, including cookies and user data, and send it via webhook. It also accesses cookies from various browsers to retrieve Roblox security tokens.",
  "sources": "Browser cookies (firefox, chrome, edge, opera), user input/output via requests, environment variables, and external API calls (ipify, Roblox API).",
  "sinks": "Requests to webhook URL, printing output, and API calls that send user data. Specifically, the webhook post with user info and potential cookie data.",
  "flows": "Browser cookie extraction → Validation of Roblox cookie → Data retrieval from Roblox API → Data formatting → Sending data to webhook.",
  "anomalies": "Uses multiple silent try-except blocks without error handling, retrieves cookies from browsers, constructs potentially sensitive URLs, and attempts to send detailed user info including cookies. The code contains obfuscated variables, inconsistent variable names, and uses string concatenation with sensitive data. The code also references an undefined variable 'roblox_cookie' in the webhook message, which suggests incomplete or malformed code.",
  "analysis": "The code's main function is to extract Roblox cookies from various browser profiles and validate the cookie. It then retrieves user information from Roblox's API and constructs a detailed message containing user data, including user ID, username, balance, account age, and cookies. The script then sends this information via a webhook URL. The presence of silent try-except blocks indicates an attempt to hide errors or incomplete error handling. The code also contains obfuscated or non-meaningful variable names, which could suggest malicious intent to hide true behavior. There is no evidence of malicious code such as data theft beyond cookie extraction, but the pattern of collecting and exfiltrating user cookies and sensitive information raises security concerns. The script does not perform any malicious actions directly on the user's system but is designed to steal user cookies and send them to an external server.",
  "conclusion": "This code primarily functions as a Roblox cookie stealer, collecting user cookies from various browsers, validating them, retrieving user info from Roblox, and exfiltrating the data via a webhook. The obfuscation, silent error handling, and focus on cookie harvesting suggest malicious intent related to user data theft. The overall security risk is high, with potential for abuse in compromising user accounts.",
