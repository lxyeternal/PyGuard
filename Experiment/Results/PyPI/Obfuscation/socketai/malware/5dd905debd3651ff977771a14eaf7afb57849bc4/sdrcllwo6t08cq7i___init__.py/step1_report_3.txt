  "purpose": "The script appears to extract Roblox security cookies from various browsers, verify their validity, retrieve user info via Roblox API, and send user data to a Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "Browser cookie files (.ROBLOSECURITY cookies from Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Opera), Roblox API endpoints, user input via cookies.",
  "sinks": "Requests to Discord webhook URL, POST request sending user info, potential use of cookie data in requests and data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Cookie extraction from browsers -> Cookie validation -> Roblox API info retrieval -> Data aggregation -> Data sent to Discord webhook.",
  "anomalies": [
    "Hardcoded Discord webhook URL and message ID.",
    "Multiple empty or suspicious variables with obfuscated or meaningless names.",
    "Use of 'os.system' for clearing console and executing commands, which could be abused.",
    "Fetching cookies across multiple browsers without validation or user consent.",
    "Attempt to retrieve and send potentially sensitive user info including cookies, user ID, and IP address.",
    "Code contains references to variables and URLs with inconsistent or placeholder content, indicating possible obfuscation or incomplete code."
  ],
  "analysis": "The code gathers cookies from various browsers related to Roblox security tokens. It validates the cookies via Roblox API and fetches user details such as user ID, username, Robux balance, account age, and profile info. The code constructs messages with this info and posts them to a Discord webhook URL hardcoded at the start. There are multiple suspicious aspects: use of 'os.system' to execute commands, hardcoded webhook URL and message IDs, and retrieval of cookies without explicit user consent. The code’s structure and variable names suggest obfuscation or intentional concealment. It potentially exfiltrates user information, including cookies and IP addresses, which is malicious behavior. There are no indications of malicious payloads such as malware or system damage, but it appears designed to harvest and transmit user data surreptitiously.",
  "conclusion": "This script is primarily designed to steal Roblox cookies and user information and send it to a remote Discord webhook. It contains several suspicious and potentially malicious behaviors, especially related to data exfiltration and lack of user consent. While it does not exhibit direct malware functionality like damaging files or reverse shells, its purpose to harvest and transmit private data marks it as malicious in intent.",
