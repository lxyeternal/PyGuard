  "purpose": "The script appears to extract Roblox cookies from browser storage, validate the cookie, gather user information via Roblox API, and then send this information to a specified webhook URL.",
  "sources": "Browser cookie storage for '.ROBLOSECURITY' cookies across multiple browsers, including Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Opera, and Chromium-based browsers.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST request to a webhook URL with user information, including potentially sensitive Roblox cookie data.",
  "flows": "Cookies are retrieved from browser storage -> Cookie validity is checked via Roblox API -> User data (ID, username, friends, age, creation date, headshot, balance, premium status) is fetched -> Data is sent via POST request to webhook with embedded Roblox cookie.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses obfuscated variable names and executes system commands via os.system. It also includes hardcoded webhook URL and potential credential leakage by sending cookie data. The code fetches cookies from multiple browsers without user consent and sends them to an external endpoint. Usage of 'robloxpy' for API interactions suggests intent to gather detailed user info, and printing potentially sensitive info in the console.",
  "analysis": "The script extracts Roblox '.ROBLOSECURITY' cookies from various browsers, which could be considered malicious if done without user consent. It validates the cookie by calling Roblox API, and if invalid, sends a notification to the webhook with the expired cookie. It then proceeds to gather user information such as UserID, username, friends count, account age, and profile details. All this data, along with the cookie, is then posted to a webhook URL, effectively exfiltrating sensitive data. The use of obfuscated variable names and direct system calls further indicates malicious intent. The script does not perform any harmful actions on the user's system beyond data theft, but the exfiltration of cookies and user info without explicit permission is a serious security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to steal Roblox cookies and user information by extracting cookies from browser storage, validating them, collecting detailed user data, and sending this information to an external webhook. It demonstrates malicious behavior primarily through data exfiltration, with obfuscated variables and unconsented access to sensitive data. The overall security risk is high due to the malicious intent to harvest and transmit private user data.",
