      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious intent due to the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during package setup. While the exact payload remains unknown without decoding, the techniques used are consistent with malicious activity. The high scores assigned are justified, and further decoding of the payload is recommended for definitive analysis."
