  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated; it appears to be an import or setup script, potentially for a larger application or package.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the environment variables and possibly from imported modules or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include usage of environment variables and imported modules, which could lead to data leakage or code execution if misused.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables into the code's logic, potentially passing untrusted data into critical functions or modules.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads are detected. The code structure appears straightforward and typical.",
  "analysis": "The code was examined thoroughly for malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security flaws. No suspicious patterns, malicious backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration mechanisms were identified. Usage of environment variables is standard; no suspicious external connections or data manipulations are evident. The code lacks obfuscation, unnecessary dynamic execution, or hidden behaviors. As the code appears to be a benign setup or import script, there are no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems safe and typical for a Python project component. The confidence in this conclusion is high given the straightforward nature of the code.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
