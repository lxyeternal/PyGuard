{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be setting up a Python package with custom install and develop commands that execute potentially malicious code.",
  "sources": "The base64-encoded string in the notmalfunc() function, which is decoded and executed via os.system.",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing decoded code, which could run arbitrary commands or code on the host system.",
  "flows": "The code decodes base64 string -> executes decoded string as shell command -> potentially runs malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding for embedded code, decoding, and execution via os.system; no validation or sanitization of decoded code; the decoded code is a URL to download or connect, indicating possible malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and overrides install and develop commands to include a function 'notmalfunc' which decodes a base64 string. This string decodes to a shell command that performs an HTTP request to a suspicious URL, likely downloading or executing remote content. The execution occurs during installation, which is suspicious because it can silently run arbitrary code during package setup. No other legitimate functionality is apparent. The use of base64 encoding suggests an attempt to obfuscate malicious intent. This pattern indicates malicious behavior or supply chain attack potential, especially as code executes during package installation without user awareness.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a clear malicious payload executed during package installation, decoding and running remote code or commands. This is highly suspicious and indicates malicious intent. It is a supply chain attack vector aiming to execute remote code covertly during package installation.",
