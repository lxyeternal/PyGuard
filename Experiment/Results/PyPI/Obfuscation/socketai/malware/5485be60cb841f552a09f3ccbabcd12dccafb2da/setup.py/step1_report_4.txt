{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package, with custom behaviors during installation and development modes, including executing obfuscated code upon installation.",
  "sources": "The base64-encoded string inside the notmalfunc() function, which is decoded and executed via os.system.",
  "sinks": "The os.system() call executes decoded code that could potentially perform malicious actions such as network requests or system modifications.",
  "flows": "The base64-encoded command is decoded in notmalfunc(), then executed via os.system() during the install process, creating a source-to-sink flow from the encoded string to system execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding to conceal code logic, dynamic code execution via os.system, and the obfuscated payload suggest malicious intent or at least suspicious concealment techniques.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools and defines functions that perform potentially malicious activities. The notmalfunc() function decodes a base64 string that, when decoded, forms a shell command involving curl and string operations. This command appears to download content from a suspicious domain (cdn.discorap.com) and possibly executes it or stores it locally. The function is invoked during the package installation process, meaning the code executes upon package installation. The obfuscation via base64 and runtime execution are common tactics to hide malicious intent. No other external user input is involved, but the deliberate concealment and execution of decoded code indicate potential malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The package setup script contains a hidden payload that executes obfuscated code during installation, which downloads and possibly executes external content from a suspicious domain. This behavior suggests malicious intent or a supply chain attack vector, given the concealment and automatic execution during install.",
