{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup script that includes custom installation and development commands which execute encoded code during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded base64-encoded string within the notmalfunc() function, which is decoded and executed via os.system.",
  "sinks": "The decoded string is executed using os.system, which can run arbitrary system commands, potentially leading to malicious activity.",
  "flows": "The encoded string is decoded in notmalfunc(), then passed to os.system, executing the decoded command during package installation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding for code obfuscation, and execution of decoded code via os.system during installation, indicates potential malicious intent. The base64 string, when decoded, points to a URL and shell command.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and related commands, then defines a function b64d() to decode base64 strings. The function notmalfunc() decodes a specific base64 string and runs it via os.system. The encoded string, once decoded, contains a curl command that fetches data from a URL, likely an external server, and pipes it into a command. This behavior during installation is suspicious. The setup() call configures the package with metadata and includes custom cmdclass that invoke code execution during install or develop commands. This pattern suggests obfuscated, potentially malicious behavior designed to execute external code during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits obfuscation and executes external commands during package installation, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. It could be used to run arbitrary code fetched from an external server, representing a security risk.",
