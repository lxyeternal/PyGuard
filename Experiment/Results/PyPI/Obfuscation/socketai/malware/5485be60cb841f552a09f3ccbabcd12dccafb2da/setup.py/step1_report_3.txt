{
  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup script that includes custom install and development commands which execute obfuscated code during installation.",
  "sources": "The b64d function decodes base64-encoded string; the notmalfunc function executes system command decoded from base64; run methods in custom classes call notmalfunc.",
  "sinks": "os.system call executes decoded code, which can run arbitrary commands. The base64 string is decoded and executed, potentially leading to malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The base64-encoded string in notmalfunc is decoded and executed during package installation via AfterInstall.run, leading to execution of decoded script.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding to obfuscate a system command; code executes decoded string during installation, which is suspicious. The code is minimal but intentionally hides the payload.",
  "analysis": "The script defines setup configuration for a Python package, with custom install and develop commands. The AfterInstall class's run method calls notmalfunc, which decodes a base64 string and executes it via os.system. The base64 payload points to a URL (likely malicious) and seems intended to run remote code or fetch malicious content. The obfuscation through base64 and the automatic execution during install indicates malicious intent. The code does not perform any other benign or necessary actions and appears designed to execute hidden commands during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior, specifically executing obfuscated system commands during installation, likely to perform malicious actions or remote code execution. This indicates high malicious intent and security risk.",
