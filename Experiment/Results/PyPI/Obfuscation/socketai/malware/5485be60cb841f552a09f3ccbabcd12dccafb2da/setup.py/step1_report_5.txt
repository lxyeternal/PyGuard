{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup script that installs a package and executes obfuscated code during installation.",
  "sources": "The obfuscated base64-encoded string within the notmalfunc() function, which is decoded and executed via os.system().",
  "sinks": "The decoded code is run through os.system(), executing shell commands, which can lead to command injection or remote code execution.",
  "flows": "The base64 string is decoded by b64d(), then passed to os.system() in notmalfunc(), executing potentially malicious commands during package installation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding to hide code, execution of decoded code via os.system() during install, which is suspicious. The function name 'notmalfunc' is non-descriptive. The base64 string appears to be a URL and shell command, indicating hidden network activity.",
  "analysis": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package. It imports setuptools and overrides the install and develop commands to run additional code post-installation. The notmalfunc() function decodes a base64-encoded string and executes it via os.system(). The encoded string appears to be a cURL command that fetches a script from a remote URL. This behavior suggests potential malicious activity, such as downloading and executing remote code during package installation. The use of base64 encoding and execution of decoded code are suspicious and typical of obfuscated malicious payloads. The overall structure is typical for a setup script, but the embedded obfuscated code poses a security threat.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains malicious behavior by executing remote code during installation via obfuscated base64-encoded commands. It is highly suspicious and should be considered potentially malicious. The package could compromise systems by downloading and executing arbitrary code during installation.",
