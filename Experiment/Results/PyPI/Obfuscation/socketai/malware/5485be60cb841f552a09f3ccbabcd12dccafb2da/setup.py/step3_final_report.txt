{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to execute a base64-encoded shell command during package installation, which fetches and executes remote content, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The base64-encoded string decoded in `notmalfunc()`, which is then executed via `os.system()` during the install process.",
  "sinks": "The `os.system()` call executing the decoded shell command that performs a remote `curl` request and pipes it into `bash`.",
  "flows": "The base64 string is decoded in `notmalfunc()`, then passed to `os.system()`, executing a remote script during package installation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding to obfuscate a remote command, execution during setup without validation, and fetching code from a suspicious URL.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools and overrides install commands to run `notmalfunc()` during installation. The function decodes a base64 string that, when decoded, is a shell command involving `curl` to a suspicious URL, piping the result into `bash`. This occurs silently during package setup, which is highly suspicious. The obfuscation via base64 and remote code execution pattern strongly suggest malicious activity. The decoded URL and command pattern are typical of supply chain attacks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: ~0.9, obfuscated: ~0.8, security risk: ~0.9) are consistent with this analysis, indicating high malicious potential and risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious intent, executing remote, obfuscated commands during package installation, representing a serious security threat. The assigned scores are justified and align with the observed behavior.",
