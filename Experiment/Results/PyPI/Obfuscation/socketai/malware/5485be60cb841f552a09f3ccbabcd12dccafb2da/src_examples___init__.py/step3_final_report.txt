  "purpose": "Assessment of open source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Code snippets, environment variables, function parameters, external modules, network/file/system calls, console outputs.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, subprocess calls, environment variable access, console/log outputs.",
  "flows": "Input sources such as parameters or environment variables to sinks like network, file, or system calls.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs across reports; incomplete code snippets noted but no malicious indicators.",
  "analysis": "All reports consistently indicate benign code with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. Confidence levels vary based on completeness of code, with low to high confidence assigned appropriately. Malware scores are zero, obfuscation scores are zero, and security risk scores are low (0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal threat. The reasoning aligns with the evidence presented, and no inconsistencies are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets and assessments suggest no malicious intent or obfuscation, with low security risks. The scores are justified and consistent across reports. No adjustments are necessary; the supply chain security posture appears benign.",
