      "conclusion": "Most code snippets are benign with no malicious payloads or suspicious patterns. However, obfuscated code employing eval/exec, especially with external inputs, poses a moderate security risk. Adjusting malware scores upward for such patterns improves accuracy. Overall, the supply chain security posture remains low to moderate, with vigilance recommended for dynamic code execution patterns."
