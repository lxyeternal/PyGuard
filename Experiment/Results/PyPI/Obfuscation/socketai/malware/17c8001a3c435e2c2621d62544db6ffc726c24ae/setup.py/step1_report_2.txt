  "purpose": "Obfuscated Python code that appears to perform dynamic code execution and data decoding, likely to hide its true functionality.",
  "sources": "Reading base64-encoded strings, zlib compressed data, and dynamically generated strings through various operations, including base64 decoding, zlib decompression, and base64 decoding again.",
  "sinks": "Execution of dynamically constructed code via eval and exec, and use of setattr on __builtins__ to define 'print', 'exec', and 'eval' functions for later invocation.",
  "flows": "Sources include base64-encoded, compressed, and obfuscated strings; these are decoded and decompressed into code snippets, which are then executed via eval and exec through dynamically set built-in functions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscation techniques such as replacing code with base64 strings, zlib compression, dynamically created strings, and setting built-in functions to custom implementations. The code constructs and executes code dynamically, which is a common trait of malicious scripts. The code also uses unusual variable names and complex lambda functions to hide intent.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with obfuscated imports and variable initializations. It defines a lambda function that processes input strings by splitting and performing mathematical transformations, possibly to decode or generate payloads. There is a base64-encoded string, which is decoded, decompressed with zlib, then decoded from base64 again, and then executed via eval and exec after constructing code dynamically. The use of setattr on __builtins__ to replace 'print', 'exec', and 'eval' functions indicates an intent to control or monitor subsequent code execution. The final segment constructs code strings dynamically and executes them, likely to hide malicious behavior, perform hidden operations, or download/load further payloads. These techniques strongly suggest obfuscation aimed at bypassing static analysis and hiding malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated and designed to execute dynamically constructed code through eval and exec, with multiple layers of encoding and compression. It employs techniques typical of malicious scripts, such as hiding payloads, altering built-in functions, and executing obfuscated code. The overall risk is high, and it appears to be malicious in nature.",
