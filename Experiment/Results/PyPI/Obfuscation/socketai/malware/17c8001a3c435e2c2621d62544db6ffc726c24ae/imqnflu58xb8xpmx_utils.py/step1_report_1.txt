  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a standard Python script or module, but no specific details are provided as no code content was included in the prompt.",
  "sources": "No input sources are explicitly identified; no input functions, environment variable reads, or data fetches are evident without code content.",
  "sinks": "No suspicious sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system commands are visible without code content.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows can be identified without the actual code, making it impossible to trace data flow paths.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns are observed due to lack of code content. Cannot determine if code is obfuscated or contains hidden malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "Without provided code, an in-depth analysis cannot be performed. There are no visible sources, sinks, flows, or anomalies. The review process cannot proceed without the code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "Insufficient information to determine the purpose, risks, or malicious intent of the code. The absence of code prevents any meaningful security assessment.",
