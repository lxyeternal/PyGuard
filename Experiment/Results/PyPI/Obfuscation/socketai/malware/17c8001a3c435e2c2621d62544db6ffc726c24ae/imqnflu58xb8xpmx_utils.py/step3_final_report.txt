  "purpose": "Assess the supply chain security of the open source dependency based on available code or report summaries.",
  "sources": "No actual code provided; reports rely on summaries and inferred behaviors such as dynamic execution or obfuscation.",
  "sinks": "Not applicable due to absence of concrete code; potential sinks include eval/exec functions if present, or network/file I/O if described.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no code to trace data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Potential use of dynamic code execution functions (eval/exec), obfuscated variable names, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns as inferred concerns.",
  "analysis": "All reports lack actual code snippets, relying on summaries. Reports 2 and 3 mention potential dynamic code execution and anomalies but without concrete evidence. Scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.3 or 0.2) are generally consistent with cautious suspicion but not confirmed malicious activity. Reports 1, 4, and 5 correctly identify the absence of code and assign zero scores. The overall assessment indicates minimal supply chain risk with no confirmed malware, and the cautious scores for dynamic execution concerns are justified but could be slightly lowered if no eval/exec is confirmed in actual code.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the summaries, the dependency shows no confirmed malicious behavior or obfuscation. The risk scores are appropriately cautious, primarily reflecting potential concerns about dynamic code execution. Final malware and obfuscation scores remain at 0, with overall risk around 0.1–0.2. The evaluation aligns with the limited information; actual code review is recommended when code becomes available.",
