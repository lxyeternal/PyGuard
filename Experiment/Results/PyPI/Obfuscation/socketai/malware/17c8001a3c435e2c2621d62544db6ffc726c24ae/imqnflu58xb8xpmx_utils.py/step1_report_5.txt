  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a specific function or task within a larger Python project, but the exact purpose cannot be determined due to the absence of code content.",
  "sources": "The code does not show any explicit input sources such as file reads, network calls, or environment variables.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data leads to data leaks, system modifications, or external communications.",
  "flows": "No identifiable source-to-sink data flows are present in the provided code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code snippet is empty; no anomalies, suspicious patterns, or unusual code features are observable.",
  "analysis": "The review is limited to an empty code fragment; no code logic, data handling, or behavior is present to analyze. Without actual code content, there are no indicators of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. All assessments are based on the absence of code.",
  "conclusion": "There is no code to analyze, so no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation can be identified. The code appears to be empty or not provided, resulting in a low confidence in any potential findings.",
