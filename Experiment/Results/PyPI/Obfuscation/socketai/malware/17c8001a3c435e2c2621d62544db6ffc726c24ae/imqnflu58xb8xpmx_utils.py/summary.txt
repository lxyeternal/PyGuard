  "conclusion": "Based on the summaries, the dependency shows no confirmed malicious behavior or obfuscation. The risk scores are appropriately cautious, primarily reflecting potential concerns about dynamic code execution. Final malware and obfuscation scores remain at 0, with overall risk around 0.1–0.2. The evaluation aligns with the limited information; actual code review is recommended when code becomes available."
