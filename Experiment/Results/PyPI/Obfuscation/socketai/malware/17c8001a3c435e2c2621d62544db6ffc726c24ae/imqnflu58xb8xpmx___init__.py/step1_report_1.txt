  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be a Python script intended for some form of data processing or utility function.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from user inputs, environment variables, and possibly external files or network sources.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system commands, network transmissions, or file writes that could lead to data leaks or unauthorized actions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources to processing functions and then to output or system commands, potentially without validation or sanitization.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or obvious backdoors detected. Unusual features include dynamic code execution or obfuscated code, which are not present here. No suspicious network domains or cryptomining code are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports standard libraries, performs input collection, and includes functions that process data. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoor access. Usage of environment variables or external inputs appears standard. No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors were found.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there are no signs of malicious intent or malware. The code seems to perform its intended functions without security risks. The overall security risk is low.",
