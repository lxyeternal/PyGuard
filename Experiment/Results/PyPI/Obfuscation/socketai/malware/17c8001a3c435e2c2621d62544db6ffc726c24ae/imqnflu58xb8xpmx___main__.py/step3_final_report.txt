  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks based on provided code snippets or descriptions.",
  "sources": "Input data, environment variables, network requests, file reads, user inputs, environment configurations.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file system writes, environment variable access, subprocess calls, data outputs.",
  "flows": "Sources to sinks via data processing functions, network requests, environment reads, or command executions.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code, empty snippets, lack of suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "All reports either lack code or describe benign code snippets with no suspicious behavior. Scores for malware and obfuscation are consistently zero, aligning with the absence of malicious or obfuscated code. Risk scores are low (around 0.1 to 0.2), reflecting minimal threat levels. Confidence levels are appropriate, given the limited information. Slightly reducing risk scores in some reports (e.g., from 0.2 to 0.1) would improve consistency, but current scores are acceptable. Overall, the assessments are sound, and no evidence suggests malicious activity or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The provided reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code snippets or lack thereof. Scores are consistent with their analyses, indicating no malicious or obfuscated code and a very low security risk. No adjustments are necessary at this time.",
