{
  "purpose": "The code appears to initialize a simple web server that responds with a greeting message.",
  "sources": "Input is received via HTTP requests handled by the server; environment variables are accessed for configuration.",
  "sinks": "The server sends responses over the network; potentially logs or prints data.",
  "flows": "HTTP request data is processed and responded to without significant transformation or external data influence; environment variables influence server configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are evident. No obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or data exfiltration detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a basic HTTP server using standard Python libraries. It reads environment variables to configure the server port, which is typical and not suspicious. It handles incoming requests and responds with a static greeting message. There are no signs of malicious behaviors such as code injection, data leakage, or network connections to suspicious domains. The code is straightforward and follows normal patterns for a simple server setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward implementation of a web server with no detected malicious activity or security risks.",
