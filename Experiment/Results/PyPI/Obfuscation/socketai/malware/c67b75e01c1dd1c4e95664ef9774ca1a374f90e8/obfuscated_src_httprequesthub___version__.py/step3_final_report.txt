  "purpose": "Static configuration or metadata with obfuscated variable names and decorative Unicode characters.",
  "sources": "Variable assignments: strings, integers, Unicode characters, hexadecimal number.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow, input/output, or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static assignments only.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, Unicode emojis used decoratively, straightforward integer assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments with no functions, data processing, or external interactions. Variable names are obfuscated but not malicious. Unicode characters appear decorative. The hexadecimal number is a simple integer. No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities are present. Obfuscation is superficial and does not indicate malicious intent. Scores assigned in reports (malware=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign static data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as configuration or metadata with superficial obfuscation and decorative Unicode characters. There is no evidence of malware or malicious activity. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
