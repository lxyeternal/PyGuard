{
  "purpose": "The code sets up import statements, compatibility handling for Python 2 and 3, and defines some type aliases and imports utility functions from standard libraries for use in larger applications.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules such as chardet/charset_normalizer, json/simplejson, sys, collections, http, io, urllib.parse, urllib.request",
  "sinks": "None of the code explicitly writes data or interacts with external systems in a malicious manner",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code primarily imports modules and sets up environment compatibility",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard import operations with fallback mechanisms for optional libraries. It manages Python 2 and 3 compatibility by defining version checks and type aliases. There are no dynamic code executions, external network connections, or suspicious data handling present in this fragment. The code appears to be part of a setup or utility module typical in larger projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup snippet used for compatibility and utility functions in Python projects. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected.",
