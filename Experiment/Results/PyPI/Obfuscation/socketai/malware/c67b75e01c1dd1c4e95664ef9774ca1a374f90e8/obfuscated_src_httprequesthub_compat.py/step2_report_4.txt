  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report states that the code is a standard import/setup snippet with no malicious activity. The code primarily imports modules, handles compatibility, and sets type aliases.\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, the code is benign.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None identified.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0, Risk = 0.0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** The code does not perform any suspicious operations, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The high confidence score (1.0) is justified.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, the code is a standard environment setup with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Code presence of issues:** No.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0, Risk = 0.0 — reasonable.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity, no suspicious patterns, just dependency imports and compatibility handling.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, the code is a typical setup for compatibility and dependency management.\n- **Code presence of issues:** No.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0, Risk = 0.0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious or obfuscated code; standard imports and compatibility code.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** The code is primarily import statements and compatibility shims, with no data processing or network activity.\n- **Code presence of issues:** No.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0, Risk = 0.0 — suitable.\n- **Justification:** No malicious intent or suspicious patterns.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as others, a benign setup code snippet.\n- **Code presence of issues:** No.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0, Risk = 0.0 — justified.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious or obfuscated code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0.0. The code is purely import/setup with no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0.0, which is accurate given the code clarity.\n- **Risk Score:** All are 0.0, which is appropriate for such benign setup code.\n\n### Final thoughts:\n- The code is standard boilerplate for environment compatibility and dependency imports.\n- No evidence of malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior.\n- The high confidence scores are justified.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent with the code's benign nature. No changes needed.",
