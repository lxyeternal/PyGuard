{
  "purpose": "The code is setting up environment compatibility and importing standard libraries for processing JSON, handling HTTP requests, and string manipulation.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard Python libraries (sys, json, collections, http, io, urllib). No external input sources or data inputs detected.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that could lead to data leaks or security issues. No untrusted data handling or processing shown.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code primarily imports modules and defines compatibility variables without any data flow operations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple try-except blocks for importing libraries is standard; no suspicious or unusual code patterns observed. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code defines compatibility variables but does not perform any risky operations.",
  "analysis": "The code focuses on compatibility setup for different Python versions and conditional imports of JSON handling libraries. It imports modules for HTTP, URL processing, string manipulation, and collections. There are no functions, data processing, or input/output operations beyond imports. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity. The code appears to be boilerplate setup code for a larger project.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for environment setup and compatibility. No malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies detected. It is a standard, non-malicious setup code segment.",
