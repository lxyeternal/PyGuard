  "purpose": "Setup code for Python environment compatibility, dependency imports, and type aliasing.",
  "sources": "Import statements and fallback mechanisms for optional dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No data processing, network communication, or external data handling.",
  "flows": "None; purely import and setup operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard import operations with fallbacks for optional modules, manages compatibility between Python 2 and 3, and defines type aliases for cross-version support. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscated code. The code is typical boilerplate used in many open-source projects for environment setup. No external data flows or network activity are present. The code's purpose is purely to prepare the environment, with no dynamic execution or untrusted input handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard setup code with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behavior detected. The assigned scores (malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, risk=0.0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
