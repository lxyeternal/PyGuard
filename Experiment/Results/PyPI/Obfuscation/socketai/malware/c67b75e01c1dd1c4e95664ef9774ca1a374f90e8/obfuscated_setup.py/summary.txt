  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious behavior, primarily due to remote code fetch and execution during setup, obfuscation, and use of exec(). It should be considered malicious or compromised until remote payloads are verified safe. Installation or distribution of this package poses a significant security risk."
