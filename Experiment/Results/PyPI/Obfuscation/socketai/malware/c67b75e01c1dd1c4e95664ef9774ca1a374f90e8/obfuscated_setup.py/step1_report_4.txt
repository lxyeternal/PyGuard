{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package, handling dependencies, version checks, and custom install commands.",
  "sources": "Version information from sys.version_info, URLs fetched via urllib, and a local version file (__version__.py).",
  "sinks": "The urllib URL potentially executes code fetched from a remote server; subprocess.Popen may execute arbitrary code; exec() runs code from a version file.",
  "flows": "Code reads version info and version file -> if version mismatch, may fetch and execute remote code -> subprocess may run fetched code.",
  "anomalies": "Remote URL decoded from base64 points to a GitHub URL; code executes remote code fetched via URL; use of exec() on local version file; potential obfuscation with random strings and nonsensical variable names.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs package setup with dependency management, version checks, and custom commands. Notably, it decodes a base64 string to obtain a URL, then fetches and executes code from that URL without validation, which is suspicious. The use of exec() with code from a remote source poses high security risks. Other parts include benign-looking setup code and dependency definitions. The obfuscated variable names and the remote code execution are red flags for malicious intent. No other malicious behaviors like data exfiltration or backdoors are evident beyond the remote code fetch and execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a high-risk remote code fetch and execution based on a base64-decoded URL, which could be malicious. The setup script appears to be normal but includes suspicious remote code execution, suggesting potential sabotage or malicious behavior. Caution is advised before use.",
