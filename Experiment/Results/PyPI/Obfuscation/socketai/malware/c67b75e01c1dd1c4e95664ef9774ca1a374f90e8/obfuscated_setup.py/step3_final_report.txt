{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package that performs version checks, dependency management, and custom commands. It includes obfuscated class and variable names, and executes remote code during setup.",
  "sources": "Decoding base64 URLs, fetching code via urllib.request.urlopen, reading from __version__.py, and executing code with subprocess.Popen and exec().",
  "sinks": "Remote code fetched from external URLs executed via subprocess and exec(), potentially leading to code injection, data leakage, or system compromise.",
  "flows": "Base64-encoded URL decoded during setup -> fetched via urllib.request.urlopen -> code executed via subprocess.Popen or exec().",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and class names, remote code fetch during setup, use of exec() on local version file and fetched content, dynamic code execution, external URL pointing to GitHub.",
  "analysis": "The script performs version validation, dependency setup, and custom commands. It decodes a base64 URL pointing to a remote resource, fetches code from it, and executes it without validation. The use of obfuscated names and dynamic execution indicates an attempt to conceal malicious intent. The remote URL points to a GitHub resource, which could host malicious payloads. The code's behavior during setup, executing remote code, is a significant security concern, consistent with supply chain attack patterns. The obfuscation and remote code execution strongly suggest malicious intent, with high malware and risk scores justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious behavior, primarily due to remote code fetch and execution during setup, obfuscation, and use of exec(). It should be considered malicious or compromised until remote payloads are verified safe. Installation or distribution of this package poses a significant security risk.",
