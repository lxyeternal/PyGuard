{
  "purpose": "This module defines the core objects and functions for constructing, preparing, and handling HTTP requests and responses using the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Input sources include method, url, headers, files, data, json, params, auth, cookies, hooks, and response content.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include sending data over network, raising HTTP errors, reading response content, decoding JSON, and managing connection resources.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user inputs (method, url, headers, data, json, etc.) into request preparation, sending, response handling, and error management.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or malicious code patterns are evident. Usage of standard library and requests functions is typical.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily involves request construction, response processing, error handling, and connection management. No unsafe or malicious operations are detected. No suspicious data leaks, code injections, or covert behaviors are present. All data handling appears standard and consistent with typical HTTP request-response workflows. There is no evidence of obfuscated code or malicious payloads. The code relies on external libraries and handles data securely, with proper error handling and resource cleanup.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of request and response handling within the Requests library. No malicious or malicious-suspicious behavior detected. It is safe based on the provided snippet.",
