  "purpose": "Standard request and response handling in the requests library, including request preparation, response decoding, error handling, and link parsing.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as URL, headers, cookies, data, json payload, files, and response content.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission of request data, response content decoding, error raising, and header parsing.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into request construction, is sent over the network, and response data is decoded and processed, with error handling and link extraction as auxiliary flows.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements typical request-response logic with proper error handling and response decoding. No malicious activity such as network exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors is present. The data flows are standard, and no anomalies or suspicious patterns are observed. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), consistent with benign request handling code. The confidence level is high (around 0.9), given the straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of request handling in the requests library. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
