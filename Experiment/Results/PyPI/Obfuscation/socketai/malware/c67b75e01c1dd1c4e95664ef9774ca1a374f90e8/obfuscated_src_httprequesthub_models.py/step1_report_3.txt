{
  "purpose": "This module provides the core objects and methods for preparing and handling HTTP requests and responses using the requests library, including request preparation, response decoding, error handling, and link parsing.",
  "sources": "Reads input from parameters such as url, headers, files, data, json, params, auth, cookies, hooks, and response attributes like reason, status_code, headers, and raw object.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable points include response content decoding, raising HTTP errors, and accessing headers and raw data. No untrusted data directly flows into dangerous sinks like system commands or network connections in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (url, headers, etc.) flow into request and response objects. Response content is decoded based on headers, and errors are raised via raise_for_status().",
  "anomalies": "The code is largely standard and appears clean. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors are detected. No obfuscation or malicious code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard request and response handling functions, including preparing requests, decoding JSON content, parsing link headers, and error handling. It uses typical patterns and does not show signs of malicious behavior. No suspicious data leaks, hidden backdoors, or malicious network activity are present within this code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate, standard implementation of request handling without malicious intent or suspicious behavior. No security risks are identified in this isolated module.",
