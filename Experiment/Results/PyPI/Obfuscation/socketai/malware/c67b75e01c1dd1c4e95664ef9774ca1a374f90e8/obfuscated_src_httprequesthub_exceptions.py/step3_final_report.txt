{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes with heavily obfuscated names and static string attributes, likely for error handling within a larger framework.",
  "sources": "Import statements with aliasing, class attribute assignments, and class inheritance",
  "sinks": "No data input/output, network calls, or external system interactions are present",
  "flows": "No active data flow or external interaction; only class definitions and attribute assignments",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation through nonsensical class and attribute names, aliasing of imports, static string constants with no functional logic",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple exception class definitions with obfuscated naming patterns and static string attributes. There are no functions, data processing, network activity, or external I/O. The import aliasing and nonsensical attribute names suggest an attempt to conceal the code's true purpose. The absence of active malicious behavior indicates this is likely placeholder or obfuscated code intended to hide malicious intent or to serve as a structural component. The high obfuscation scores are justified, but the lack of evidence for malicious activity keeps malware and security risk scores low.",
  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated, which raises suspicion but does not demonstrate active malicious behavior within this fragment. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware and overall security risk remain low. Further contextual analysis is recommended to determine if this obfuscation is benign or malicious.",
