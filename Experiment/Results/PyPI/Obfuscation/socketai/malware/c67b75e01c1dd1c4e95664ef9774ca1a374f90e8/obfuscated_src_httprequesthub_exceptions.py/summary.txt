  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated, which raises suspicion but does not demonstrate active malicious behavior within this fragment. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware and overall security risk remain low. Further contextual analysis is recommended to determine if this obfuscation is benign or malicious."
