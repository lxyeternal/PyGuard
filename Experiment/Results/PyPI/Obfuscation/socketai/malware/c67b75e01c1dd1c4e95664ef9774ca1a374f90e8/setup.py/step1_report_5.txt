  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that manages dependencies, custom install/develop commands, and testing configurations.",
  "sources": "Reads from sys.argv, environment variables, external URLs (base64-encoded URL fetch), local files (__version__.py, README.md).",
  "sinks": "Uses subprocess.Popen to execute code fetched from a decoded URL; urllib.request.urlopen to fetch data from a base64-decoded URL; os.system calls for publishing; exec() on local version file.",
  "flows": "The code fetches a URL from a base64-encoded string, decodes it, and executes the response as Python code via subprocess. It also runs external commands via os.system. Data from the URL can flow into subprocess execution, possibly executing malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of base64-encoded URL that, when decoded, fetches and executes remote code; use of exec() on local file content; potentially dangerous URL embedded within code; no clear validation or security checks for remote code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup tasks, but includes a base64-encoded URL that is decoded and used in subprocess.Popen, which executes arbitrary code fetched from a remote server. This is a typical indicator of malicious behavior or supply chain attack. The use of urllib to fetch remote code and execute it dynamically without validation is highly suspicious. The rest of the code manages package dependencies and testing frameworks normally, with no other obvious malicious intent. The remote code could be malicious, backdoored, or sabotage in disguise.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious or potentially malicious remote code fetch and execution via base64-encoded URL, which is highly suspicious and indicates a supply chain attack vector. This could allow remote control or malware deployment on systems installing this package.",
