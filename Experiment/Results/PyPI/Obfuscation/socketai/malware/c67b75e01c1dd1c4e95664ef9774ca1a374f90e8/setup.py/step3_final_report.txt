{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up a Python package, but during the 'egg_info' command, it decodes a base64-encoded URL, fetches remote code from that URL, and executes it via a subprocess, which constitutes remote code execution.",
  "sources": "Base64-encoded URL string, network request to fetch code, response reading and decoding.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the fetched code via subprocess.Popen with 'python -c'.",
  "flows": "Decode base64 URL -> HTTP request to fetch code -> read and decode response -> execute code with subprocess.Popen.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding to obfuscate a URL, dynamic execution of remote code during package setup, no validation or sandboxing of fetched code.",
  "analysis": "The code in 'PostEggInfoCommand.run()' decodes a base64 string to obtain a URL pointing to a GitHub gist, makes an HTTP request to fetch code, reads and decodes the response, and executes it via subprocess.Popen with 'python -c'. This pattern enables remote code execution during package installation, representing a severe supply chain security risk. The obfuscation via base64 is a common tactic to hide malicious intent. The behavior is consistent across reports, and the scores assigned (malware: 1.0, security risk: 1.0, obfuscated: 0.8) are justified given the high severity of remote code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains malicious behavior by fetching and executing remote code during setup, constituting a high-severity supply chain attack vector. The behavior is confirmed and warrants immediate concern.",
