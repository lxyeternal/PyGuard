  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a sophisticated, obfuscated cookie management utility without any direct signs of malicious behavior. While obfuscation raises suspicion, there is no evidence of malware, data exfiltration, or network-based sabotage. The low malware and moderate risk scores are justified, but continued monitoring is recommended if integrated into larger systems."
