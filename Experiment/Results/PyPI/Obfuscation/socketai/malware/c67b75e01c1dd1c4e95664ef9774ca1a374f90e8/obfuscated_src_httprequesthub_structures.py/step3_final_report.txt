  "purpose": "Implementation of a case-insensitive dictionary for HTTP headers, allowing case-insensitive key queries while preserving the last key case.",
  "sources": "Class constructor, update methods, key access, and comparison operations.",
  "sinks": "Key lookups, iteration over headers, and internal data storage.",
  "flows": "Input data via constructor or update flows into internal storage; key queries and comparisons retrieve data.",
  "anomalies": "Mentions 'behavior is undefined' when conflicting keys with same lowercase form are provided; this is a standard caveat, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a case-insensitive header dictionary, with standard behavior and documentation. No suspicious patterns, external data leaks, or malicious code are present. The mention of 'undefined behavior' is a known caveat in such data structures and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a case-insensitive headers dictionary with no malicious activity or security risks detected. The mention of undefined behavior is a typical caveat and not a security concern.",
