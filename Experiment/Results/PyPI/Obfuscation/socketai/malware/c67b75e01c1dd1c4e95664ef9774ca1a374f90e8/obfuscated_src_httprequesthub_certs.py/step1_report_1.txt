{
  "purpose": "To print the file path of the installed CA bundle provided by the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The 'where' function from the 'certifi' module, called within the main block.",
  "sinks": "The output of the 'print' function; no untrusted data is used here.",
  "flows": "The 'where' function returns a trusted file path, which is then printed directly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns. The code simply uses a well-known library to output a file path.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'where' from the 'certifi' package, which provides the path to a trusted CA bundle. When executed, it prints this path. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no data processing, no external network interactions, and no suspicious code structures. The code's purpose appears to be for informational or debugging purposes. It does not contain any obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and only outputs the trusted CA bundle path from the certifi package. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
