  "purpose": "To retrieve and print the path to the CA bundle file used by the certifi library.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from certifi import where' reading the certifi package's 'where' function.",
  "sinks": "The 'print(where())' statement outputs the path string to standard output.",
  "flows": "Import certifi's 'where' function (source), then invoke 'where()' and print its result (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code performs a straightforward library function call and output.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'where' from the certifi library, then when executed as the main program, it prints the path to the CA bundle certificate file used by certifi. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The code is minimal and standard, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The purpose appears to be to identify the location of the trusted CA bundle for verification or diagnostic purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and performs a simple informational task. There are no malicious behaviors or security concerns present.",
