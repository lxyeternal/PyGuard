  "purpose": "To retrieve and print the path to the trusted CA bundle provided by the certifi library.",
  "sources": "The import statement from the certifi library, and the call to where() function.",
  "sinks": "The print() function outputs data to the console; no untrusted data flow or external data sinks are involved.",
  "flows": "Import certifi.where() -> print(where())",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns. The code is straightforward and standard for fetching CA bundle path.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'where' function from the 'certifi' library and prints its result. This is a common operation to locate trusted CA certificates. There are no hardcoded credentials, network connections, data leaks, or obfuscated code. The usage is standard and safe. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident in this simple code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign script to display the path to the CA bundle from certifi. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
