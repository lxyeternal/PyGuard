{
  "purpose": "The code retrieves and prints the path to the certificate bundle provided by the certifi package.",
  "sources": "Importing the 'where' function from the 'certifi' package and calling it in the main block.",
  "sinks": "The 'print' function outputs the path to the console; no untrusted data is processed or sent elsewhere.",
  "flows": "The code imports a trusted library function and outputs its returned value to stdout without any modification or user input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code performs a benign, standard operation.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a standard library function from 'certifi', which is commonly used to verify SSL certificates. It then prints the path to the certificate bundle. The code is minimal, straightforward, and does not include any dynamic execution, data transmission, or other potentially malicious activities. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, benign script that outputs the location of the trusted SSL certificate bundle. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
