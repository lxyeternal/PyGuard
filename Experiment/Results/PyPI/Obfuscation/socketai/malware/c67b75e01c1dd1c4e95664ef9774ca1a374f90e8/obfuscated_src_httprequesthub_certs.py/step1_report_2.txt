{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to print the path to the trusted certificate bundle provided by the 'certifi' library.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'certifi' library by calling the 'where' function.",
  "sinks": "The output of the 'where' function is printed to standard output.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'where' function (source) directly to the 'print' statement (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward, uses standard library functions, and does not include suspicious or obfuscated constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'where' function from the 'certifi' package, which returns the path to the trusted CA bundle. It then executes this function and prints the result when run as the main module. There are no indications of malicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. The code performs a simple, legitimate operation related to SSL/TLS certificate validation. No external or untrusted data sources or sinks are involved beyond the standard output. The package 'certifi' is a well-known, trusted package used for SSL certificate verification.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility script that outputs the location of the certificate bundle used by 'certifi'. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious anomalies, and poses no security risks.",
