  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**  \nAll reports describe the code as importing `where` from `certifi` and printing its result. The code is straightforward, minimal, and standard for locating the CA bundle path.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**  \n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  No. The code does not contain any malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious elements. It simply outputs a trusted file path.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is benign, with no anomalies or malicious intent.  \n- The reasoning is sound: the code calls a well-known, trusted library function and outputs its result without processing untrusted data.\n\n4. **Scores Review**  \n- **Obfuscated score (0)** is appropriate; no obfuscation is present.  \n- **Malware score (0)** is correct; there's no malicious activity.  \n- **Security risk (0)** is justified; the code is benign.\n\n5. **Risk Score Justification**  \n- All reports assign a `securityRisk` of 0, which is justified.  \n- The code performs a simple informational operation with no external or untrusted data flows.\n\n6. **Malware and Obfuscated Scores**  \n- Since no malicious or obfuscated behavior is detected, scores should remain at 0.\n\n7. **Additional Considerations**  \n- The code's purpose is purely informational, and it uses a trusted library (`certifi`).  \n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code does not involve network operations, data processing, or external inputs.\n\n**Summary of my assessment:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nThe current scores are accurate and justified. The code is benign, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Overall, I agree with the reports' conclusions.**  \n**My estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is a straightforward utility script with no security issues.",
