{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be an installation script for a Python package that also executes potentially malicious payloads during installation.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', external URL requests to 'https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php' and 'https://python-release.com/python-install.scr', and file operations writing to disk.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URLs, file creation and execution ('os.system' call), and network communication for data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "The environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' is sent to a remote server. During installation, a binary from an external URL is downloaded and executed via 'os.system'.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated function and variable names, fetching and executing remote code without validation, and communication with suspicious domains. The code suppresses exceptions silently, potentially hiding malicious errors.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a function with an obfuscated name that retrieves the system's 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable and sends it to a remote server. It conditionally downloads a binary from a suspicious URL ('https://python-release.com/python-install.scr') when on Windows, saves it locally, and executes it immediately. The class extending 'install' overrides the install method to run this function during package installation, which is unusual and indicates malicious intent. The package setup includes obfuscated naming and minimal metadata, possibly to evade detection. The code's primary goal appears to be tracking the system name and executing external malicious payloads upon installation.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting system info and executing remote payloads during installation. Its obfuscation and external connections are suspicious. The package should be considered unsafe for use.",
