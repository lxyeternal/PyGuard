  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates high malicious intent, actively downloads and executes external payloads, and exfiltrates data. The obfuscation and network activity further confirm malicious behavior. Scores of malware (0.9), obfuscation (0.8), and security risk (0.9) are justified and consistent with the evidence."
