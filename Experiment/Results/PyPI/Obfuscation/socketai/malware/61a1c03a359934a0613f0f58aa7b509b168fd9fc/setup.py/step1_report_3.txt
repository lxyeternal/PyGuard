{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, with additional code to execute during installation.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' and downloads files from external URLs during installation.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URLs and executing downloaded files via 'os.system'.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' -> URL request to 'https://linkedopports.com/...'; URL request -> saving and executing a file from 'https://python-release.com/...'.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual function names, obfuscated variable names, and code that downloads and executes external scripts during installation. Use of broad exception handling that suppresses all errors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup tools and adds custom installation behavior. The function 'PUysjocldSgegXKfQCQcHiCXJwhrGjcJ' retrieves the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable, makes a GET request to a suspicious domain, then, if on Windows, downloads an executable from a suspicious domain and executes it. This behavior indicates potential malicious activity, such as downloading and executing arbitrary code during package installation. The broad 'try-except' block suppresses errors, reducing transparency. The use of obfuscated variable names and unconventional function names suggests an attempt to hide malicious intent. The package setup process triggers this code during installation, which can compromise the system on which the package is installed.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by downloading and executing external code during package installation, which could lead to system compromise. The obfuscation and malicious activity indicate high malicious intent, making this package unsafe for use.",
