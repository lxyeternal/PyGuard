{
  "purpose": "Detects malicious activity during package installation, including remote code download, execution, data exfiltration, and obfuscation.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', network requests to suspicious URLs, downloaded executable file, obfuscated functions and variables.",
  "sinks": "os.system() executing downloaded payload, network requests sending data to external domains.",
  "flows": "Reading environment variable -> sending data to remote URL -> downloading executable -> executing via os.system()",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated code, broad exception handling, external network activity during setup, execution of unverified external payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code is obfuscated and performs malicious actions: it reads system info, contacts suspicious URLs, downloads and executes an external executable without validation, all during package installation. Broad exception handling conceals errors. These behaviors are characteristic of malware and supply chain sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates high malicious intent, actively downloads and executes external payloads, and exfiltrates data. The obfuscation and network activity further confirm malicious behavior. Scores of malware (0.9), obfuscation (0.8), and security risk (0.9) are justified and consistent with the evidence.",
