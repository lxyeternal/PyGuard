  "purpose": "The code defines a function that prints a message indicating installation, then calls this function.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs to the console via print().",
  "flows": "Function call leads to executing print statement; no external data flow is involved.",
  "anomalies": "The function name appears obfuscated or nonsensical, possibly to hide intent. No other suspicious activity or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function with a seemingly random name and immediately calls it to print a message. There are no external data sources, no network activity, no use of environment variables, or other potentially malicious behavior. The unusual function name might suggest obfuscation, but the actual code is benign and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and benign, likely serving as a placeholder or minimal script. The obfuscated function name could be intended to conceal intent, but no malicious activity is evident.",
