{
  "purpose": "A simple function that prints 'installed' and is invoked immediately, likely serving as a placeholder or indicator.",
  "sources": "No external data sources, inputs, or environment variables; only a print statement.",
  "sinks": "Output to console; no data sinks or external communication.",
  "flows": "Function call leads directly to print output; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function name; minimal code structure; no malicious patterns or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an obfuscated function that outputs a static message and executes immediately. It involves no external input, network activity, or data manipulation. The obfuscated name suggests an attempt to conceal intent but does not correlate with malicious behavior. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions indicate benign intent. The obfuscation score is moderate due to the nonsensical name, but no malicious activity is present. The malware score should be zero, and the security risk is minimal.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving likely as a placeholder or simple indicator. No malicious activity or security vulnerabilities are evident. The obfuscation is superficial and does not imply malicious intent. The current scores are appropriate, with malware score at 0, obfuscation at approximately 0.6, and risk at 0.1.",
