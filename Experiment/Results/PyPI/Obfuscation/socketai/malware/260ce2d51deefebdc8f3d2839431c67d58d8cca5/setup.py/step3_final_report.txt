{
  "purpose": "Execute a PowerShell command encoded in base64 during package setup if the 'tahg' directory does not exist, likely for malicious or stealthy activity.",
  "sources": "Checks for existence of 'tahg' directory; reads no external input; executes encoded PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the encoded PowerShell command; potential network activity or payload execution within the command (not directly visible).",
  "flows": "Directory check ('tahg') -> condition true -> subprocess.Popen runs encoded command with hidden window.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64-encoded PowerShell command executed silently; broad try-except blocks suppress errors; package name and version appear arbitrary; no decoding or validation of the command.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a directory check, then executes a base64-encoded PowerShell command silently if the directory is absent. The command is obfuscated, indicating potential malicious intent. The silent execution with hidden window and obfuscation are red flags. The broad exception handling conceals errors, and the package metadata appears arbitrary, possibly to evade detection. Without decoding the command, the exact payload cannot be confirmed, but the pattern strongly suggests malicious or backdoor activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to stealthy, obfuscated PowerShell execution during setup. The behavior aligns with common tactics in malicious package distribution, warranting caution and further analysis of the encoded command.",
