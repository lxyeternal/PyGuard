{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package, including custom install and develop commands that download and execute a remote script.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.md file; the veCWXCnfjifUTyWAzNEgUShJiOVJRXEr() function fetches data from a remote URL and writes it to 'install.bat'.",
  "sinks": "The remote content is saved to 'install.bat' and executed via os.system, potentially running malicious code downloaded from the internet.",
  "flows": "Input from remote URL (via requests.get) flows into writing 'install.bat', which is then executed through os.system, allowing remote code execution.",
  "anomalies": "The function veCWXCnfjifUTyWAzNEgUShJiOVJRXEr() automatically downloads and executes a remote script during package installation. The URL appears suspicious, and executing downloaded code poses a security risk.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a local README file for package description. It imports standard modules and defines a function that downloads a script from a Discord CDN URL and executes it using os.system. The setup() call includes custom commands that invoke this function during development and installation. This behavior allows remote code execution during package installation, which is highly suspicious. There are no hardcoded credentials or obfuscation, but the automatic fetching and executing of external code is a major security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes a potentially malicious behavior: during package setup, it downloads and executes code from an external source without user consent or verification. This indicates high malicious potential and security risk, as it could execute arbitrary malicious code on the target system.",
