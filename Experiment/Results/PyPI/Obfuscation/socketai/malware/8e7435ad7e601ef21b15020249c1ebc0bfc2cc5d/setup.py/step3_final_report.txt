{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom setup command that, during installation, collects system information (hostname, current working directory, username) and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external URL, indicating covert data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser() — data collection points; requests.get() — data transmission point.",
  "sinks": "requests.get() function transmitting data to external server.",
  "flows": "Source functions (hostname, cwd, username) pass data to requests.get() which sends it to 'http://5r13v9.ceye.io'.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names; network request during package installation; use of a known monitoring/test domain; data exfiltration without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code employs obfuscation and performs covert data collection during setup, transmitting system info to an external server. The suspicious URL and network activity during installation are indicators of malicious intent. The obfuscation suggests an attempt to conceal malicious behavior. The network request to 'http://5r13v9.ceye.io' aligns with known data exfiltration or testing domains. The behavior is not typical for legitimate packages, indicating malicious or at least highly suspicious activity. The scores assigned in the reports (malware, obfuscation, security risk) are consistent with this behavior, with high confidence and severity levels justified by the covert exfiltration and obfuscation. The activity poses a significant privacy and security threat, warranting a high malware score (around 0.9), high obfuscation (around 0.9), and a security risk score of approximately 0.9.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior through covert data exfiltration during installation, employing obfuscation to conceal its intent. The external URL is suspicious, and the network activity is abnormal for standard setup scripts. The assigned scores are appropriate and reflect a high threat level. This package should be considered malicious and avoided.",
