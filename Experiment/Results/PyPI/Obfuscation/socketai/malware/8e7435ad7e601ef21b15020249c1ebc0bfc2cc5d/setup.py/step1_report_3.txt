  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to collect system information and send it to a remote server during package installation.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser() – gathering hostname, current directory, and username; requests.get() – sending data to remote server.",
  "sinks": "requests.get() – transmitting collected data over the network.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, cwd, username) -> requests.get() to remote server 'http://5r13v9.ceye.io'.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a custom install command class with obfuscated class name; sending system data during install, which is unusual for typical setup scripts; remote URL is suspicious and resembles a known tracking or C&C domain.",
  "analysis": "The code redefines the 'install' command in setuptools to perform additional actions during package installation. It collects hostname, current directory, and username, then sends this info to an external server via an HTTP GET request. The URL used ('http://5r13v9.ceye.io') is suspicious, as it resembles a command and control or tracking domain. The purpose appears to be covert data exfiltration during installation, which is not typical behavior for legitimate setup scripts. The obfuscated class name and the inclusion of network activity in a setup process are indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, as it secretly collects system information and transmits it to an external server during package installation. This behavior indicates potential data theft or surveillance activity embedded within a package's setup routine.",
