{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, with custom installation behavior that sends system information to an external server.",
  "sources": "The code reads system hostname, current working directory, and username using socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), and getpass.getuser().",
  "sinks": "The data collected is sent via an HTTP GET request to 'http://5r13v9.ceye.io' using the requests library.",
  "flows": "Source data (hostname, cwd, username) flows from source functions into the dictionary, which is then sent via requests.get() to the specified URL.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs data exfiltration during package installation without user consent, which is unusual and suspicious for a setup script. The URL '5r13v9.ceye.io' is a known domain used for DNS and HTTP data collection, often in security testing or malicious activities. The obfuscated class and method names suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom installation command that, during package installation, gathers sensitive system information and transmits it to an external server. This behavior is not typical or expected in a standard setup script and indicates potential malicious activity, such as system reconnaissance or data theft. The use of obfuscated class and method names further supports malicious intent. There are no other suspicious code constructs such as code injection, malicious payloads, or backdoors. The external communication occurs immediately upon installation, which is a security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during package installation without user consent. It uses obfuscation and communicates with a suspicious domain, indicating malicious intent. This package should be considered dangerous and avoided.",
