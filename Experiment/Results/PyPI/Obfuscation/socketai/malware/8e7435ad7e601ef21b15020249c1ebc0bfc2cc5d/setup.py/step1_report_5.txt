{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom installation command that collects system information and sends it to an external server during package installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the hostname, current working directory, and username from the environment, and performs an HTTP GET request to an external URL with this data.",
  "sinks": "The HTTP GET request to 'http://5r13v9.ceye.io' transmits potentially sensitive system data over the network.",
  "flows": "The system information (hostname, cwd, username) is gathered and then sent via requests.get() to the specified external URL during package installation.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses obfuscated class and variable names, and the data transmission occurs automatically during install without user consent, which is unusual. The URL used is a known Ceye.io domain often associated with monitoring or data exfiltration. No user-visible prompts or explicit documentation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a class inheriting from 'install', and overrides the 'run' method (obfuscated as 'hqZqhTFmeHGRWJLUPbSYRIbOCiKCgBsL') to perform additional actions during installation. It collects hostname, current working directory, and username, then makes a GET request to an external server, transmitting this information. This behavior could be used for surveillance or data exfiltration. The obfuscation and the nature of the external request raise suspicion about malicious intent. The URL 'http://5r13v9.ceye.io' is a known domain used for monitoring or capturing data, which supports this concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior by collecting system information and transmitting it to an external server during package installation. The obfuscated naming and the use of a known monitoring domain suggest malicious intent, potentially for surveillance or unauthorized data collection.",
