{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to set up a Python package and extend the installation process to perform additional actions during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information such as hostname, current working directory, and username. It also uses the 'requests' library to send data over the network.",
  "sinks": "The 'requests.get' function transmits system information to an external URL ('http://5r13v9.ceye.io'), which could be a data exfiltration point.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom install command collects system info (hostname, cwd, username) and sends it via an HTTP GET request to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses an obfuscated class name and method names, which is suspicious. It also makes an outbound network request during installation, which is unusual for typical package setup scripts. The URL used for data transmission appears to be a known testing or monitoring endpoint, potentially for tracking or malicious data collection.",
  "analysis": "The code modifies the standard setup process by subclassing the 'install' command and adding a step that gathers hostname, current directory, and username, then sends this info to an external server. The obfuscated class and method names may aim to conceal malicious intent. The network request during installation is unusual and potentially malicious, as it leaks system info without user consent. No other malicious code or hardcoded secrets are present, but the network activity is suspicious and could be used for data collection or malicious tracking.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs an unusual and potentially malicious action by exfiltrating system information during package installation, which is not typical behavior for legitimate setup scripts. The obfuscated naming and network request are suspicious, indicating possible malicious intent or privacy violations.",
