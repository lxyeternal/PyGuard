      "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior through covert data exfiltration during installation, employing obfuscation to conceal its intent. The external URL is suspicious, and the network activity is abnormal for standard setup scripts. The assigned scores are appropriate and reflect a high threat level. This package should be considered malicious and avoided."
