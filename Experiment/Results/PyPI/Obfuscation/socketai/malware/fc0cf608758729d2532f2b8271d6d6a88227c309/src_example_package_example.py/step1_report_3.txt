{
  "purpose": "Increment a given number by 1",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'number'",
  "sinks": "Return statement (output of the function)",
  "flows": "Input 'number' flows directly to the output after incrementing",
  "anomalies": "Function name appears obfuscated, but code itself is straightforward and simple; no hardcoded credentials, no suspicious operations",
  "analysis": "The function takes a single input 'number' and returns its value incremented by 1. The function name appears obfuscated, which could be a red flag, but the code performs a trivial arithmetic operation without any side effects, data leaks, or external interactions. There are no indications of malicious behavior or obfuscation beyond the naming. No hidden code, environment variable usage, or data transmission detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple increment function with an obfuscated name. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based on its content. The obfuscated name alone is not sufficient to classify it as malicious, especially given the minimal logic.",
