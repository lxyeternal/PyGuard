  "purpose": "Simple function to increment a number by one",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'number'",
  "sinks": "Return statement; no external sinks or data leaks",
  "flows": "Input 'number' flows directly to the output after increment",
  "anomalies": "Function name appears obfuscated and nonsensical, no additional code or context",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function with an obfuscated name that takes a single input 'number' and returns it incremented by one. There are no external data sources, no input validation, no use of environment variables, and no suspicious code patterns. The function itself performs a trivial operation. The obfuscated function name may be intended to hide intent, but functionally, it is benign and simple.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a straightforward increment operation with an obfuscated name. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this fragment. The use of an obscure name is suspicious but not malicious by itself.",
