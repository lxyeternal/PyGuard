{
  "purpose": "The function appears to increment a number by 1, likely intended for basic numeric operations.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'number' is a source of untrusted data if provided externally.",
  "sinks": "The return statement outputs the incremented number, which is a simple operation with no apparent data leaks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the input parameter 'number' directly to the return statement after incrementing.",
  "anomalies": "The function name 'EdOTrgwqDdIqxhrciHjWqzwZVzLNwAxo' is obfuscated and nonsensical, indicating possible intentional concealment. The code is minimal but could be part of a larger obfuscated codebase.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function with an obfuscated name, which takes an input and returns the input incremented by 1. There are no other operations, no external I/O, and no complex logic. The obfuscated name raises suspicion about concealment. However, the function itself performs a benign operation without any malicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious network activity, and no malicious sinks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple increment function with an obfuscated name. While the obfuscation suggests potential concealment, the code itself is benign and does not exhibit malicious behavior. No security risks are evident beyond the obfuscation aspect.",
