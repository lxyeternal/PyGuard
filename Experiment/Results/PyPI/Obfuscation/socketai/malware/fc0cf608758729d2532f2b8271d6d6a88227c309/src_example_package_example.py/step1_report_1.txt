{
  "purpose": "The function appears to increment a given number by 1, likely intended for simple arithmetic or utility purposes.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'number' is the source of untrusted data.",
  "sinks": "The function returns the incremented value, which is a benign sink with no external or dangerous effects.",
  "flows": "Input 'number' flows directly into an addition operation, then the result is returned.",
  "anomalies": "Function name is obfuscated and nonsensical, and the variable name is generic. No external data, environment variables, or side effects are present. No suspicious code patterns, backdoors, or malicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single function with an obfuscated name that takes an input and returns that input incremented by 1. The logic is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious side effects. The naming does not suggest malicious behavior but indicates obfuscation, which could be an attempt to hide functionality. However, the actual code does nothing harmful or suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple increment function with obfuscated naming. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The obfuscation alone does not imply malicious intent in this context.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0.7,
