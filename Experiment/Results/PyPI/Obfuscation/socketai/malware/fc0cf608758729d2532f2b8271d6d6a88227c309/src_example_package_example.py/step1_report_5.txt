  "purpose": "The function appears to be a simple increment operation, returning the input number plus one.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'number' as a data source",
  "sinks": "Return statement sending data back as output",
  "flows": "Input 'number' flows directly to the output after incrementing",
  "anomalies": "Function name appears obfuscated; no external dependencies or malicious code present; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function with an obfuscated name, performing a basic arithmetic operation (adding 1). The function's logic is straightforward and does not contain any side effects or external calls. The obfuscated function name might be an attempt to hide intent, but the operation itself is benign. There are no input/output anomalies, no hardcoded credentials, no network activity, and no malicious constructs identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple increment function with an obfuscated name. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. The function's simplicity indicates low suspicion, although the obfuscated name might suggest an attempt to hide purpose, but function logic itself is harmless.",
