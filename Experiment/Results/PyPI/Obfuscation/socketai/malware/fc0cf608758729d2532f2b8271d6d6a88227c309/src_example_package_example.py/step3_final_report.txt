  "purpose": "A simple function that increments a number by 1, with obfuscated naming.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'number' received by the function.",
  "sinks": "Return statement outputs the incremented number; no external data or untrusted sources are used.",
  "flows": "Input 'number' flows directly to the return statement after incrementing.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function name; no malicious code, side effects, or external communication detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward increment function with an obfuscated name. It performs a benign operation without external dependencies or side effects. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not indicate malicious intent. The scores from reports assign malware as 0, obfuscation around 0.7, and low security risk (~0.1), which are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No anomalies or malicious patterns are present. The function's simplicity and lack of malicious logic support a conclusion of minimal risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, trivial increment function with obfuscated naming. While obfuscation raises suspicion, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security threats. The scores are appropriate and consistent, indicating a very low security risk.",
