  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Input data read from environment variables, network connections, or file systems; function parameters; user inputs.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file writes, environment variable access, system commands, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources feeding into sinks directly or via data processing functions, potentially leading to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, suspicious network domains, obfuscated code, unusual data flows, or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "Given the absence of code snippets, all reports correctly identify the lack of code and appropriately assign zero scores for malware and obfuscation. Reports that include code descriptions or analysis are consistent in their reasoning, with confidence levels aligned with the evidence. Slightly cautious risk scores (0.2-0.3) are justified given the potential for hidden issues, but no concrete evidence of malicious activity is present. The scores are internally consistent and reflect the limited information available.",
  "conclusion": "All reports are appropriate given the lack of code; no malicious or obfuscated code detected. The risk scores are conservatively assigned, aligning with the cautious analysis. No adjustments are necessary; overall, the dependency appears benign based on current information.",
