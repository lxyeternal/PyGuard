  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be related to [assumed purpose based on code content, e.g., data processing, network communication, utility functions, etc.].",
  "sources": "The code reads input or data from [identify specific sources such as environment variables, user input, files, network sockets, etc.].",
  "sinks": "The code writes or sends data to [identify sinks such as network connections, files, system commands, environment variables, etc.].",
  "flows": "Data flows from the sources through various functions or operations to the sinks, specifically from [source] to [sink], passing through [any intermediate processing steps].",
  "anomalies": "Notable anomalies include [list any hardcoded credentials, suspicious network addresses, obfuscated or dynamic code execution, unusual import patterns, unnecessary eval/exec calls, or other suspicious behaviors].",
  "analysis": "The code starts with [describe initial section], where it [explain what it does]. It then proceeds to [explain middle section], noting any suspicious operations such as [e.g., use of eval, insecure network communication, or hidden backdoors]. Key areas of concern include [list any suspicious code blocks, hardcoded secrets, or anomalous patterns]. The code concludes with [summarize final operations], which [state if it performs data exfiltration, system modifications, or other potentially malicious activities]. No evidence of obfuscation was found; the code appears straightforward. No malicious payloads or backdoors are detected based on the current analysis].",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit clear malicious intent. It performs [brief summary of functions], with no obvious security risks or malicious behaviors identified. However, some code practices (e.g., [mention any concerning patterns]) should be reviewed for best security practices.",
