{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be setting up a Python package using setuptools, but it also contains malicious activities such as fetching and executing remote code, sending data to external servers, and potentially executing arbitrary scripts.",
  "sources": "Remote URLs via requests.get (https://pastebin.com/raw/3xcr2My4 and https://utilities.tk/rscode), file reading (README.md), and environment paths (os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__)))",
  "sinks": "Requests POST requests to external servers with system information, writing to a file, executing a downloaded script with subprocess.Popen",
  "flows": "Remote code fetched via requests.get() → written to a local file → executed via subprocess.Popen; environment info and script content sent via POST requests",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes remote code execution, data exfiltration, writing and executing potentially malicious scripts, and sending system info to external servers. The code attempts to execute arbitrary code fetched over the network, which is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with importing 'setuptools' and then attempts to import 'requests', 'random', and 'os'. It fetches a script from a remote URL and posts data to a pastebin URL, including a message with '@everyone' tag, indicating potential spam or malicious notification. It generates a random filename, downloads additional remote code into it, then posts system information to a remote server. Finally, it executes the downloaded script via subprocess.Popen. The setup configuration appears standard but is likely a cover for malicious activities. These activities involve remote code fetching, data exfiltration, and execution, which are highly suspicious and indicative of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains clear malicious behavior, including remote code execution, data exfiltration, and arbitrary script execution. These activities pose significant security risks and suggest the package is malicious, primarily designed for unauthorized remote control, data theft, or botnet activities.",
