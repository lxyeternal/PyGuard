{
  "purpose": "The code fetches external scripts, executes them dynamically, and posts system info and messages to external URLs, indicating malicious intent such as remote code execution and data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Requests to 'https://pastebin.com/raw/3xcr2My4' and 'https://utilities.tk/rscode?r=mewhenrscode', reading 'README.md', and system environment variables via os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__))",
  "sinks": "requests.post() calls sending data to external URLs, subprocess.Popen() executing fetched scripts with shell=True, writing files to disk",
  "flows": "External GET requests -> fetched code written to file -> system info posted -> subprocess executes the fetched code",
  "anomalies": "Use of requests to fetch and post data from suspicious URLs, dynamic filename creation for scripts, execution with shell=True, no obfuscation but malicious behavior evident",
  "analysis": "The code performs network requests to fetch remote scripts and posts data including system info to external servers, then executes the fetched code asynchronously via subprocess with shell=True. These behaviors are characteristic of malware, enabling remote control, data theft, or system compromise. The setup configuration appears legitimate but is likely a cover. The code is not obfuscated, but its actions are malicious. The high malware score (~0.95) and security risk (~0.95) are justified given the remote code execution, data exfiltration, and potential for system compromise.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates clear malicious behaviors, including remote code fetching, execution, and data exfiltration. The high scores are appropriate, and the package should be classified as malicious to prevent deployment or use.",
