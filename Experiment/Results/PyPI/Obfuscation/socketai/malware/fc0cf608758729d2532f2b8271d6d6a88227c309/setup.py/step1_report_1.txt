  "anomalies": [
    "Unusual network requests to pastebin.com and utilities.tk, possibly for command and control",
    "Dynamic creation and execution of a Python script fetched from an external URL",
    "Posting content back to Pastebin with system info and directory paths",
    "Use of shell=True in subprocess.Popen, which can be dangerous",
    "Hardcoded URL and possibly obfuscated variable names"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing necessary modules. It then makes a GET request to a Pastebin URL, and posts the response content along with a notification '@everyone' to the same Pastebin, indicating possible command-and-control communication. It fetches a script from an external URL, writes it to a dynamically named file, and executes this script via subprocess.Popen with shell=True, which is a common technique for executing downloaded malicious code. Additionally, it posts system information (the directory path) back to Pastebin. The code continues with standard setuptools setup, which appears legitimate but may be a cover for malicious activity. The network activity and dynamic code execution strongly suggest malicious intent, such as remote command execution or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains multiple indicators of malicious behavior, including fetching and executing remote scripts, posting system info, and communicating with external servers. Although the package setup appears legitimate, the embedded code poses significant security risks. The overall security risk is high due to the remote code execution and data exfiltration activities.",
