{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to perform malicious activities during package installation, including reading system environment variables, making external network requests, downloading an executable file from a suspicious URL, and executing it, potentially leading to system compromise.",
  "sources": "Reads 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable; makes HTTP GET requests to external URLs; downloads a file from 'https://python-release.com/python-install.scr'; executes the downloaded file via 'os.system'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the downloaded executable via 'os.system'; potential data exfiltration through network requests; silent exception handling masks errors that could reveal malicious activity.",
  "flows": "Reads environment variable -> Sends data via HTTP GET request -> Downloads executable -> Saves to disk -> Executes file with 'os.system' during setup.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names; silent exception handling; downloading and executing external code during package installation; use of suspicious URLs; no legitimate setup logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code reads the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable and sends it to a remote server via an HTTP GET request. If on Windows, it downloads an executable from a suspicious URL and executes it silently during setup. The obfuscated naming and silent error handling are red flags. These behaviors are characteristic of supply chain malware designed to execute arbitrary code on the target system, potentially leading to system compromise or data theft. The code does not perform any legitimate setup tasks and actively downloads and runs external payloads, confirming malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior, including remote data exfiltration and execution of external payloads during installation. The obfuscation and network activity strongly suggest malicious intent, making this package highly dangerous and unsuitable for use.",
