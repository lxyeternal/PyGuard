{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package that includes additional installation steps involving downloading and executing external files.",
  "sources": "os.environ['COMPUTERNAME'], requests.get() calls for URLs, environment variables, and potentially executable files downloaded from external domains.",
  "sinks": "Executing downloaded files via os.system(), making network requests to external domains, reading environment variables, and writing files to disk.",
  "flows": "Reads COMPUTERNAME environment variable -> Sends data to external URL -> Downloads executable -> Executes downloaded file during installation.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual obfuscated function and variable names, downloading and executing files from suspicious domains, lack of error handling, and running external executable during setup. The code combines setup with network activity and remote code execution, which is atypical for a normal setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup modules but adds a custom installation class that triggers a function during install. This function retrieves the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable, then makes an HTTP request to a suspicious URL, potentially sending this data. It also downloads an executable file from a domain that appears unrelated to typical package hosting and runs it automatically. The code's obfuscated variable names and the external activity during package installation are highly suspicious and indicative of malicious intent or a supply chain attack. The code does not perform any validation or sandboxing of downloaded content, which increases risk.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains malicious behavior likely intended to execute arbitrary code on the target system during package installation, possibly to establish persistence, download additional payloads, or exfiltrate data. Its obfuscated style and external downloads are clear red flags. The package should be considered dangerous for use.",
