{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, but it contains malicious behavior intended to download and execute a file from a suspicious external URL during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', makes HTTP requests to external URLs, and executes downloaded files via os.system.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executes a potentially malicious executable downloaded from an external server, and the requests.get calls send data to external URLs.",
  "flows": "The environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' is sent to 'https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php', and the downloaded file from 'https://python-release.com/python-install.scr' is executed via os.system.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual code includes dynamic network requests based on environment variables, downloading and executing a file during setup, and use of broad exception handling that suppresses errors. The URL domains are suspicious and non-standard.",
  "analysis": "The script imports modules and defines a function that retrieves the system's COMPUTERNAME environment variable. It then makes a GET request to a remote server, appending this environment variable. If on Windows, it downloads a file from a suspicious URL and executes it with os.system. The execution of remote files during installation is highly suspicious and indicates malicious intent. The code also suppresses errors silently, which can hide malicious actions. The setup configuration is standard, but the custom install class runs malicious code during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates malicious behavior by downloading and executing external files during installation, likely for malicious purposes. It aims to establish remote communication and execute potentially harmful code on the host system. The overall security risk is high.",
