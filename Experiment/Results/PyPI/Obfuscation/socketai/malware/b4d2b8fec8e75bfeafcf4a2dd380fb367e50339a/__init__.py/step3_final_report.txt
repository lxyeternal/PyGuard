  "purpose": "A simple script that defines and calls a function to print 'installed'.",
  "sources": "No external data sources, inputs, or environment variables; only internal function call.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data leaks, network activity, or external interactions.",
  "flows": "Function definition (source) directly leads to its invocation (sink) with no external data involved.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function name, but no malicious or suspicious code behavior; the code is trivial and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an obfuscated function that prints a static message and calls it immediately. No external inputs, network activity, or data leaks are present. The obfuscation is superficial and does not indicate malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, with some assigning moderate obfuscation scores due to the function name. Malware scores are consistently zero, and security risks are minimal. The code poses no security threat or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, trivial, and does not pose any security risks. The obfuscation is superficial and likely intended to obscure the function name rather than conceal malicious intent. All assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
