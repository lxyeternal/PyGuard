{
  "purpose": "The code defines and calls a function that prints a message indicating installation status.",
  "sources": "Function definition and invocation, no external input sources.",
  "sinks": "Console output via print statement; no data leaks or external interactions.",
  "flows": "Function call leads directly to printing static message; no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "Function name appears obfuscated, but it does not execute any malicious code or suspicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function with an obfuscated name and immediately calls it, resulting in a printed message. There are no signs of data injection, external data handling, or malicious payloads. The obfuscated function name could be an attempt to hide intent, but the function itself only outputs a static message. No other code or logic is present that indicates malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a simple, benign print operation with an obfuscated function name. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation appears superficial and likely for minimal concealment rather than malicious intent.",
