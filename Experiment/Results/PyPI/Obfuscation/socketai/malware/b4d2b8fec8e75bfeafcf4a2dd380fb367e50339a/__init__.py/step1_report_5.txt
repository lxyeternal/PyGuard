  "flows": "Function call leads to execution of print statement",
  "anomalies": "Function name appears to be a nonsensical or obfuscated string; no other suspicious behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function with an obfuscated name that, when called, prints 'installed'. The function is immediately invoked after definition. There are no external inputs, no network activity, no use of environment variables, no dynamic code execution, and no sensitive data handling. The function name appears to be a random or obfuscated string, which could suggest an attempt to hide intent, but the actual code executed is benign. Overall, the code is very simple and does not perform any malicious activities or suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward script that defines and calls a function printing a message. The obfuscated function name may suggest an attempt to hide intent, but the behavior itself is benign. There are no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
