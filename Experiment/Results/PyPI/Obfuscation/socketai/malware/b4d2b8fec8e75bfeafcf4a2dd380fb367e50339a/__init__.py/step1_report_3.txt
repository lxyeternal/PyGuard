{
  "purpose": "The code defines a function that prints a message indicating installation and then calls the function, likely for confirmation or logging purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only executes internal print statements.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data to external systems, files, or networks. It solely outputs to the console.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow exists; the function call executes a print statement internally with a static string.",
  "anomalies": "The function name appears to be obfuscated with random characters, which may suggest an attempt to hide intent. The code performs a simple print statement with no parameters, indicating minimal complexity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function with a nonsensical name, possibly obfuscated, which prints 'installed'. The function is then called immediately after its definition. There are no external inputs, network activity, or file operations. The simplicity and obfuscated naming could be an attempt to hide malicious intent, but as it stands, it only outputs a message. No suspicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious actions are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be benign, likely used for a simple notification or marker. The obfuscated function name could be suspicious, but the behavior itself is harmless. No malware or security risks are identified.",
