  "purpose": "Import all contents from a local source file and initialize the colorama library, likely for terminal styling.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .src_file, and the initialize() call from colorama.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no data leakage or malicious output indicated.",
  "flows": "Imports from local module; initialize() sets up terminal styling but does not process untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import from local source file; this can obscure code behavior and potentially hide malicious code. No other suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports all definitions from a local module, which could be a vector for hidden malicious code if src_file contains harmful instructions. The call to colorama.initialize() is a standard setup function for terminal styling and does not introduce security issues. The code itself is minimal and does not perform any data processing or network operations. The use of wildcard import warrants caution, but on its own, it is not malicious. Overall, the code appears benign but relies on the content of src_file.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet is not inherently malicious but employs a wildcard import from a local module, which can hide malicious behavior if present. The initialize() call is standard and safe. No evidence of malicious intent or security risk in this fragment alone.",
