{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from a local module 'src_file' and initializes colorama for terminal styling.",
  "sources": "Imports from the local module '.src_file' and the 'colorama' library.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks or external data flows are present in the code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the imported modules into the namespace; no external data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports ('from ... import *') from a local module, which can obscure imported content and potentially hide malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs minimal operations: importing all from a local module and initializing colorama. Wildcard imports can conceal malicious or unwanted functions if the source module is compromised. The 'initialize()' call from colorama is standard for terminal styling and poses no security risk. No network activity, data leaks, or obfuscated code are present. The wildcard import is the primary concern, but without evidence of malicious content, the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and straightforward, with the main security consideration being the wildcard import from 'src_file', which could hide malicious code if that module is compromised. No malicious behavior or obfuscation is detected. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.2, reflecting cautiousness due to import practices but no active threat.",
