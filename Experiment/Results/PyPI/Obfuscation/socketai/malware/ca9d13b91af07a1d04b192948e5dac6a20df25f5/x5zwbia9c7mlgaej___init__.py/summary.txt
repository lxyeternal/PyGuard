  "conclusion": "The code is benign and straightforward, with the main security consideration being the wildcard import from 'src_file', which could hide malicious code if that module is compromised. No malicious behavior or obfuscation is detected. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.2, reflecting cautiousness due to import practices but no active threat."
