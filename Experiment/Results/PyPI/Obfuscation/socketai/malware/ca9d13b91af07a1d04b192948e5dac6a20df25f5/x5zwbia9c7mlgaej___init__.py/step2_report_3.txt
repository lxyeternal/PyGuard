  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** The code is straightforward, importing all from a local module and initializing colorama. No malicious code or anomalies are evident.\n- **Errors/flaws:** The report correctly notes that wildcard import can hide malicious code if 'src_file' is compromised. However, it emphasizes the risk based on the import method rather than actual evidence.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 seem reasonable given the analysis.\n- **Justification for risk score:** Since no malicious activity is detected, 0.2 is appropriate, reflecting minimal concern primarily due to import practices.\n- **Malware score:** Correctly 0, as no malicious behavior is identified.\n- **Conclusion:** The report is reasonable and cautious but not overly alarmist.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Similar to Report 1, no malicious code detected.\n- **Errors/flaws:** The analysis emphasizes the wildcard import as a potential concern but notes that the code itself is benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 seem appropriate.\n- **Justification for risk score:** Given the lack of malicious activity, 0.2 is justified.\n- **Malware score:** Correctly 0.\n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning aligns with the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; no malicious code observed.\n- **Errors/flaws:** Consistent with previous reports; notes that wildcard import can hide malicious code but no evidence is present.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are reasonable.\n- **Justification for risk score:** No active threat detected; the risk score is appropriate.\n- **Malware score:** Correctly 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate and cautious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same as previous; no malicious activity.\n- **Errors/flaws:** Correctly identifies the wildcard import as a poor practice but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 seem justified.\n- **Justification for risk score:** No evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** Correctly 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same as others; no malicious code.\n- **Errors/flaws:** Appropriately notes that wildcard import can obscure malicious code but no evidence is present.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are appropriate.\n- **Justification for risk score:** No active threats, so low risk is justified.\n- **Malware score:** Correctly 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Sound reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of all reports:\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is benign in its current form.\n- The primary concern is the use of wildcard imports, which could hide malicious code if 'src_file' is compromised. However, without evidence, this remains a potential risk, not an active one.\n- All malware scores are 0, which is appropriate.\n- Risk scores are consistently low (0.2), reflecting minimal concern.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation evident)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (low, mainly due to import practices)\n\n**Note:** If I were to assign scores independently, considering the minimal code and lack of evidence, I would agree with the current scores.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate, cautious, and consistent. The code appears benign, with the main issue being the use of wildcard imports, which should be reviewed if source code is available. No changes to scores are necessary based on the provided information.",
