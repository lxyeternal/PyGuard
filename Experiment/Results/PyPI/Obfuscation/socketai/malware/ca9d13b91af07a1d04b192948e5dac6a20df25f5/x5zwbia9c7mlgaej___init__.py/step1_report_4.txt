{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from a local module '.src_file' and initializes the 'colorama' library, likely for terminal color handling.",
  "sources": "Import statement from '.src_file', and 'initialize()' call from 'colorama'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output observed.",
  "flows": "Imports are static; 'initialize()' executes without processing external input.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from ... import *' can obscure imported content, but it is common in terminal color libraries. No suspicious hardcoded credentials or malicious code evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports all symbols from a local module, which could potentially include malicious or unintended functions, but this is standard practice in some cases. The call to 'initialize()' from 'colorama' sets up terminal color output, which is a benign and common operation. There are no signs of data leakage, malicious code execution, or suspicious network activity. The code is minimal and does not include any complex logic or obfuscated elements. The overall structure does not indicate malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, primarily initializing the 'colorama' library and importing local functions. No malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious anomalies are detected based on this snippet.",
