  "purpose": "Import all contents from a local module and initialize colorama for terminal coloring.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .src_file and the initialize() function call from colorama.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is processed or exposed.",
  "flows": "Code imports internal module data; initialize() sets up colorama but does not process external data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import from a local source can obscure actual imported functions or variables; calling initialize() from colorama is typical for terminal styling and not inherently suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports all contents from a local module, which could potentially hide malicious or unintended functions or variables if the local module contains harmful code. The call to colorama.initialize() is standard for setting up terminal coloring and does not involve untrusted input or malicious behavior. There are no evident malicious payloads, network activity, or suspicious code behavior in this snippet. The overall structure and usage are typical for setting up a Python script with styled output. No obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious data flows are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard imports and initialization for terminal styling without any evident malicious intent or security risks. The use of wildcard import from a local module could be considered poor practice but does not indicate malicious behavior.",
