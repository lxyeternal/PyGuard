{
  "purpose": "Obfuscated script likely designed to execute hidden or malicious code after decoding and deobfuscating data.",
  "sources": "Input data includes hardcoded encoded strings and data decoded from base64 and zlib compressed data, as well as string manipulations and evaluation functions.",
  "sinks": "eval() function executing dynamically reconstructed code, possibly executing arbitrary code or payloads decoded from encoded data.",
  "flows": "Hardcoded encoded data (base64, zlib) is decoded and transformed through multiple layers, then executed via eval(). The obfuscation involves dynamic string generation and evaluation, leading to execution of potentially malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated code with multiple layers of encoding, use of eval() on dynamically constructed strings, base64 and zlib decoding, and code that generates and executes code at runtime. The code contains base64-encoded binary data, and complex lambda functions with unclear purpose.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with importing modules commonly used for encoding, decoding, and obfuscation. It constructs a string with obfuscated lambda functions and encoded data. The code constructs a string from byte operations, decodes base64 data, decompresses it with zlib, then further processes it with base64 decoding and string manipulations. The critical part is the eval() call, which executes dynamically reconstructed code. The embedded data and string manipulations suggest an intent to hide malicious payloads. The code's structure indicates an attempt to hide the true purpose through multiple layers of encoding and obfuscation, making static analysis difficult. This is typical of malicious scripts designed to evade detection while executing hidden payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly obfuscated and employs multiple decoding layers and dynamic execution, strongly indicating malicious intent. It is designed to hide its true payload and execute arbitrary code at runtime, which could be malicious. The use of eval() on decoded data is a significant security risk, and the obfuscation techniques further confirm malicious behavior.",
