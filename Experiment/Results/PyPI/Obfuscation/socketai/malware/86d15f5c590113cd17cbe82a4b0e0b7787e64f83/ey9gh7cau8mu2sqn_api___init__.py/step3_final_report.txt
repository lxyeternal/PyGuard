{
  "purpose": "Assess the supply chain security of the open source Python dependency by analyzing code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code snippets, functions, and patterns within the package; data inputs such as environment variables or external inputs.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, dynamic code execution points, or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input functions or environment reads to sinks like network transmissions or file modifications, indicating potential malicious data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded secrets, suspicious network domains, use of eval/exec, obfuscated code segments, or unusual control flow patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious activities. It uses standard libraries and benign constructs. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious network activity are detected. The confidence levels are high where code is present, and low where no code is available. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign assessment. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are observed, and the overall structure indicates a safe dependency.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency appears benign with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, and the scores accurately reflect the analysis. No modifications are necessary; the supply chain security posture is considered safe.",
