  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, files, network responses, or user inputs. Specific sources cannot be identified without code details.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network transmissions, file writes, execution of system commands, or database operations. Specific sinks are not explicitly identified without code details.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks through function calls or data processing steps. Precise flows cannot be mapped without code content.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected from the provided information. Cannot determine anomalies without code content.",
  "analysis": "Insufficient information to perform a detailed step-by-step analysis. No code was provided to evaluate data sources, sinks, flows, or anomalies. Cannot identify malicious patterns or security issues without actual code snippets.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of provided code, no malicious behavior or security risks can be identified. The code appears benign or no assessment is possible with the current data.",
