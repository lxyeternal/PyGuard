{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform some data processing or utility functions, but without specific context, the exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Data is read from environment variables and potentially from user input or external files.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data may reach system calls, network connections, or file writes, though no explicit dangerous sink is evident.",
  "flows": "Data from environment variables and user inputs may flow into functions that handle data processing or storage, but no malicious flow is detected.",
  "anomalies": "There are no obvious hardcoded credentials or suspicious obfuscated code. Some dynamic import or execution patterns might be present but are not conclusive of malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and uses common patterns without suspicious constructs. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious network activity are evident. Usage of environment variables and data processing appears benign. The code structure suggests utility or setup functions, but no clear malicious or maliciously obfuscated patterns are detected. Lack of external calls to suspicious domains or obfuscated code reduces concern.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no apparent signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems standard, with no malicious payloads or suspicious flows detected. Confidence in this assessment is high, and the malware and obfuscation scores are low.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
