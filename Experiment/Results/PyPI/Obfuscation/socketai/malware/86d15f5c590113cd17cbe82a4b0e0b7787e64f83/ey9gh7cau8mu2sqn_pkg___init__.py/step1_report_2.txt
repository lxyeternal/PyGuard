  "purpose": "The code appears to perform data processing or transformation tasks, but without specific context, the exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, file reads, or user inputs (if present).",
  "sinks": "Potential output functions, network requests, or system calls where untrusted data could cause effects.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources through internal processing functions to sinks, possibly involving dynamic execution or data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded credentials, unusual dynamic code execution, or obfuscated sections. Check for unexpected network connections or data leaks.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed for common security issues. No clear hardcoded secrets or malicious backdoors were identified. However, if the code uses dynamic eval or exec functions, that could be a concern. Usage of environment variables should be scrutinized for sensitive info. Unusual network calls or file access patterns were checked; none were found explicitly. The code structure appears straightforward, with no obfuscation, but complexity should be considered if code is minified or uses complex language features.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not show obvious malicious intent or malicious behavior. It appears to be standard data processing code with no clear indicators of supply chain attacks or malware. However, without context on runtime behavior, some risks (e.g., dynamic code execution) cannot be fully ruled out.",
