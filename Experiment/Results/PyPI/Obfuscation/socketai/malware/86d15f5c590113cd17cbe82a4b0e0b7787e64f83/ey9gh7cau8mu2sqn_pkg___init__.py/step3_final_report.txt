  "purpose": "Assess the supply chain security and malicious potential of the open source dependency based on provided code reviews.",
  "sources": "Input data from code files, environment variables, network communication points, data processing functions.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission functions, environment variable access, data output points, dynamic code execution functions.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or input functions feed into processing or network functions; potential malicious flows include data exfiltration or code injection via eval/exec.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious network domains, or obfuscated code detected; no backdoors or malicious payloads observed.",
  "analysis": "The code reviews consistently indicate benign, straightforward code with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious indicators. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0) align with the absence of malicious activity. The security risk scores are low (0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal concern about data flows or network activity, which is appropriate given the benign descriptions. Confidence levels are high (0.8-0.9), supporting the conclusion of safety.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the comprehensive reviews, the dependency appears safe with no evidence of malware or obfuscation. The low security risk scores are justified. Minor adjustments could include lowering the risk score from 0.2 to 0.1 for increased precision, but current scores are acceptable and consistent with the evidence.",
