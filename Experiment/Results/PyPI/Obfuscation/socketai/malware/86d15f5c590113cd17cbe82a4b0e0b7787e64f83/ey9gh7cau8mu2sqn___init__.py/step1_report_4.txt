{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from the local module 'api' and defines a version string for the package.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from .api import *' which reads code from the local 'api' module; the assignment of '__version__'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; no untrusted data handling, network operations, or sensitive data output.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'api' module into the current namespace via wildcard import; version string is set locally.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('import *') can obscure data flow and is generally discouraged, but it is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code only performs a module import and assigns a version string. The import statement could import potentially malicious or insecure code if the 'api' module is compromised, but based solely on this snippet, there is no malicious behavior. No suspicious or unusual code constructs are present. The code itself is minimal and does not perform any operations that could be malicious or indicate sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module setup with a version identifier and a wildcard import. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this snippet. The only concern is the use of 'import *', which can obscure what is imported but does not indicate malicious intent.",
