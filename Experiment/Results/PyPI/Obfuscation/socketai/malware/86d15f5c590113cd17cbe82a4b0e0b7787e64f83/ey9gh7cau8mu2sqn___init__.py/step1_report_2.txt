{
  "purpose": "Import all symbols from the local 'api' module and define the package version.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .api module, version string assignment",
  "sinks": "Potentially any imported functions or variables, but no explicit sinks present",
  "flows": "Imported symbols may be used elsewhere; version string is static",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual behavior; simple import and assignment",
  "analysis": "The code performs a wildcard import from a relative module named 'api', which could bring in many symbols. The version is a static string. There are no signs of malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious behavior. The use of 'from .api import *' can be considered poor practice but not inherently malicious. No malicious intent or malware behavior detected in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple module import and version declaration with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
