{
  "purpose": "This code initializes a package by importing all symbols from a local 'api' module and sets a version string.",
  "sources": "Import statement 'from .api import *' reads symbols from the 'api' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data flows are present; no data leaks or external communications are evident.",
  "flows": "The source (import) potentially exposes symbols to the package namespace; no further data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' is generally discouraged due to namespace pollution but is common in package __init__.py files; no malicious or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, performing a relative import from a local module and setting a version string. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling occurs. The import * pattern can obscure symbol origins but is standard in package initialization. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's simplicity and known practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The only minor concern is the use of 'import *', which can obscure symbol origins but does not constitute a security risk. Overall, the code is safe and standard for package initialization.",
