{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from the 'api' module and defines a version string for the package.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .api import * imports data from a local module named 'api'. The version string __version__ is a static assignment.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks; no untrusted input handling, network operations, or data leaks are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks are observable in this snippet. The import could load code at runtime, but this is standard Python behavior and not inherently malicious.",
  "anomalies": "Using 'import *' can obscure which parts of 'api' are used, but this is common in package initializations and not necessarily malicious. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no suspicious behavior or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code imports everything from a local module and defines a version string. There are no evident security issues, no code execution, network activity, or obfuscated elements. The minimalistic nature of the code suggests standard package initialization.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a typical package __init__.py file setting up the module and version, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. No security concerns are identified based on this snippet.",
