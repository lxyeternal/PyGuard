{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple module that imports everything from a local 'api' module and sets a version string.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .api module, setting __version__ variable",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external data flows observed",
  "flows": "No data flows detected; only static assignments and import statements",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from .api import *' can be considered poor practice due to namespace pollution, but it is not inherently malicious; no other anomalies present",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement and a version assignment. There are no dynamic code executions, data processing, network operations, or suspicious patterns. The import statement uses a relative import, which is typical in package modules. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are evident. The simplicity of this snippet suggests it is a boilerplate or initialization code segment.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is minimal and does not perform any dangerous operations. No malware or obfuscation indicators are present.",
