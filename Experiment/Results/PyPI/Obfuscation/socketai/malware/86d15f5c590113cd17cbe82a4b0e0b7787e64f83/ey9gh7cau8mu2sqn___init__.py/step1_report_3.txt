{
  "purpose": "The code imports all components from a local module named 'api' and sets a version string for the package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .api module; setting of __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of imported components in downstream code; setting of version string is benign.",
  "flows": "Imported components may be used elsewhere; no direct flow in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from .api import *' can hide imported symbols and make analysis difficult, but this is common in package __init__.py files. No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of a relative import from the 'api' module and defines a version string. There are no malicious functions, data leaks, or suspicious logic. The use of 'import *' in package __init__.py is a standard pattern and does not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscated or malicious code segments are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initializer that imports components and sets a version. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident based on this snippet.",
