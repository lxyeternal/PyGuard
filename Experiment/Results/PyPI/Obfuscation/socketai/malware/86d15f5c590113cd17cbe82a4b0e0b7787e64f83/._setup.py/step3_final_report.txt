  "purpose": "macOS extended attribute metadata indicating quarantine status for downloaded files",
  "sources": "Extended attributes data, specifically 'com.apple.quarantine' attribute",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows; static metadata with no sinks involved",
  "flows": "No data flow; static metadata not processed or executed",
  "anomalies": "Presence of non-ASCII characters and metadata bytes, but consistent with system attributes, not malicious obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code is a binary blob representing macOS quarantine metadata, not executable code or script. No signs of code injection, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. The data is static system metadata indicating quarantine status, which is normal for downloaded files. No suspicious behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or network activity are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0-0.1) are appropriate given the benign nature of the data. The presence of unusual characters is typical in metadata and does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the data poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed data is benign macOS quarantine metadata with no malicious code, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores and assessments in the reports are accurate and justified.",
