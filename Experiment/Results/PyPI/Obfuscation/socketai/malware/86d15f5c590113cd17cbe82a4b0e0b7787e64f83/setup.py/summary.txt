  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior through covert collection and exfiltration of system information to a suspicious IP address. It is not obfuscated but uses encoding to hide data. The activity poses a high security risk, justifying high malware and risk scores. The behavior aligns with reconnaissance or espionage activities, making it a serious threat if encountered in a package."
