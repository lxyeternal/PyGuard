  "purpose": "The code appears to prepare and send system information to a remote server, likely for tracking or reconnaissance purposes.",
  "sources": "Data is collected from socket connections (IP address), os.getlogin(), platform.node(), platform.uname(), and os.getcwd(). These are system and environment details gathered during execution.",
  "sinks": "The data is encoded in base64 and sent via an HTTP GET request to an external IP address (http://129.226.195.123/v/). The setup function is used for package configuration, but the primary concern is the network request.",
  "flows": "System information (IP, login, hostname, system details, current directory) flows from source points to the base64 encoding step, then flows into the HTTP request's URL as a parameter, reaching the remote server.",
  "anomalies": "The code collects extensive system details and encodes them before exfiltration, which is suspicious. The IP address used in the request is hardcoded and does not relate to the package's functionality. The package name and version appear arbitrary. The request URL's IP and the data exfiltration pattern are typical of malicious data collection.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers system information including local IP, user login, hostname, system info, and current directory. This data is encoded using base64, then sent to a remote server via a GET request. The code also imports standard build tools like setuptools, suggesting it might be a package setup script. However, the key malicious behavior is the silent collection and transmission of potentially sensitive environment data to an external server, which could be used for malicious tracking or reconnaissance. The use of hardcoded IP address and obfuscated data transfer indicates malicious intent, or at least suspicious activity. No other malicious code (such as backdoors, command execution, or data theft) is evident outside this exfiltration activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code's primary suspicious activity is covertly collecting system details and exfiltrating them to a remote server, which indicates malicious behavior. The package setup functionality appears normal but is likely used as a cover for the malicious data collection. Overall, the script exhibits high malicious potential.",
