{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information (login, hostname, uname, current directory, IP address) and exfiltrates it to a remote server via an HTTP GET request, embedded within a package setup script.",
  "sources": "os.getlogin(), platform.node(), platform.uname(), os.getcwd(), socket connection to 8.8.8.8:53 for IP address",
  "sinks": "requests.get() call to external IP with base64-encoded data in URL",
  "flows": "System info sources → data encoding in base64 → HTTP GET request to external server",
  "anomalies": "Collection of sensitive system info during package setup, transmission to suspicious IP, use of base64 encoding to obscure data, redundant imports, embedding exfiltration in setup()",
  "analysis": "The code gathers sensitive system information including login name, hostname, system details, current directory, and external IP address. It encodes this data in base64 and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded suspicious IP address. The inclusion of setup() suggests an attempt to distribute or hide malicious activity. The code is straightforward, not heavily obfuscated, but performs covert data exfiltration without user consent. The behavior indicates malicious intent, consistent with reconnaissance or data theft activities. The high malware score (around 0.9) and security risk score (around 0.9) are justified given the exfiltration pattern. The obfuscation score remains low (~0.2) as the code is transparent beyond base64 encoding. Overall, the code is malicious, with high risk due to covert information theft, embedded within a package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior through covert collection and exfiltration of system information to a suspicious IP address. It is not obfuscated but uses encoding to hide data. The activity poses a high security risk, justifying high malware and risk scores. The behavior aligns with reconnaissance or espionage activities, making it a serious threat if encountered in a package.",
