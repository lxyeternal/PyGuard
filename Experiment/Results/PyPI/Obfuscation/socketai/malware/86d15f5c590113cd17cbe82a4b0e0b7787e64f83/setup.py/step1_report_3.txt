{
  "purpose": "The script appears to gather system information and send it to a remote server, potentially for malicious tracking or data exfiltration, while also setting up a Python package.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (os.getlogin()), system info (platform.node(), platform.uname(), os.getcwd()), network connection (socket to 8.8.8.8), and base64 encoding of collected data.",
  "sinks": "HTTP GET request to a suspicious IP address with encoded data, and execution of setup for a package that might be used for distribution.",
  "flows": "Collect system info -> encode in base64 -> send via HTTP GET request to remote server.",
  "anomalies": "Use of socket connection to 8.8.8.8 to determine local IP address (often used for network reconnaissance); sending system info to a hardcoded IP address; obfuscated data encoding and transmission; inclusion of setup code which could be used to distribute malicious packages.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing several modules and establishing a socket connection to 8.8.8.8:53 to determine the local IP address. It then constructs a string containing a package name, login, hostname, system info, current directory, and IP address. This string is base64 encoded and sent via an HTTP GET request to a specific IP address (129.226.195.123). The setup function creates a Python package with arbitrary identifiers. The combination of system data collection, network communication to a suspicious IP, and packaging suggests an intent to harvest system info and possibly distribute malicious payloads or establish backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior patterns such as system reconnaissance, data exfiltration to a suspicious server, and potential setup for malicious package distribution. The use of obfuscation and hardcoded IP further supports suspicion. Overall, it is highly likely to be malicious.",
