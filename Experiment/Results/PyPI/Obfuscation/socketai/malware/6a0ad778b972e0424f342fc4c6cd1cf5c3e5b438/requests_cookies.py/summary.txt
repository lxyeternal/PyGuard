  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard cookie management utility with significant obfuscation. While no concrete malicious activity is identified, the obfuscation raises suspicion and warrants further static and dynamic analysis before deployment. The current scores are appropriate given the evidence, with a slight concern due to heavy obfuscation but no definitive malicious behavior."
