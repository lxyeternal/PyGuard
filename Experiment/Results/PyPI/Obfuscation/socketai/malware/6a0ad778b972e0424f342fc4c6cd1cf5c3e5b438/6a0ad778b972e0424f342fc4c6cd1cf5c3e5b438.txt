      "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated but does not exhibit any signs of malware or malicious activity within this fragment. The high obfuscation could be used to conceal malicious payloads in a larger context, but based solely on this code, it appears benign. The malware score is low, and the risk score is moderate due to obfuscation. Overall, the code does not pose an immediate threat but should be reviewed in context."

      "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated HTTP client library with no explicit malicious payloads or network activity. The high obfuscation level raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. The low malware score (0.2) reflects this, while the high obfuscation score (0.75) indicates concern over concealment. The overall security risk is moderate (0.3), primarily due to obfuscation practices. Further dynamic analysis and review of the entire package are recommended before deployment."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard cookie management utility with significant obfuscation. While no concrete malicious activity is identified, the obfuscation raises suspicion and warrants further static and dynamic analysis before deployment. The current scores are appropriate given the evidence, with a slight concern due to heavy obfuscation but no definitive malicious behavior."

No evidence of malware or malicious behavior is present. Minor adjustments could be made to the malware score in Report 2 to lower it slightly, but current scores are reasonable given the context."
