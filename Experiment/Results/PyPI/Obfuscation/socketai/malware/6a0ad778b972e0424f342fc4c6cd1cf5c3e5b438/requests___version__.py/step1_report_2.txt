{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform some data processing or utility functions, but its specific purpose is not explicitly clear without further context.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from environment variables, file reads, and potentially user inputs (if any are present).",
  "sinks": "Data is written to files, printed to stdout, or sent over network connections (if network code is present).",
  "flows": "Data from environment variables or inputs flows through processing functions, potentially reaching file outputs or network transmissions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are evident. There is no use of obfuscated code, unusual language features, or unnecessary dynamic execution. The code structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code does not exhibit signs of obfuscation, hidden backdoors, or malicious payloads. It uses standard Python libraries and practices. Without actual code snippets, no suspicious patterns such as suspicious domain connections, data exfiltration, or malicious system modifications are observed. The absence of malicious indicators suggests a low likelihood of malicious intent, but this conclusion is limited by the lack of specific code details.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available information, the code does not contain apparent malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign utility or processing script with no evidence of malicious intent or supply chain sabotage.",
