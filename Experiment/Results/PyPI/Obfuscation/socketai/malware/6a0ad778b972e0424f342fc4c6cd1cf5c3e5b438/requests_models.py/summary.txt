  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated HTTP client library with no explicit malicious payloads or network activity. The high obfuscation level raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. The low malware score (0.2) reflects this, while the high obfuscation score (0.75) indicates concern over concealment. The overall security risk is moderate (0.3), primarily due to obfuscation practices. Further dynamic analysis and review of the entire package are recommended before deployment."
