{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple Python script that imports standard libraries and performs basic operations, likely for data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "Data sources are not explicitly defined; no external input reading functions or network calls are present.",
  "sinks": "No insecure data handling or untrusted data outputs are detected. The code does not write to files, send network requests, or display sensitive info.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks is observed. The script processes local data within its scope.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code constructs, such as obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or dynamic code execution, are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard imports, simple variable assignments, and function definitions. There are no signs of malicious behavior like data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The overall structure is straightforward and typical for utility scripts.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with no suspicious patterns detected.",
