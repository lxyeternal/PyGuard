  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not provided or visible in the prompt.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables and possibly from external libraries, but the actual input sources are not visible in the prompt.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file operations, or system commands, but specifics are not shown in the prompt.",
  "flows": "The source-to-sink paths cannot be determined without actual code content; thus, no explicit flow can be identified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are observable due to lack of code content. Cannot determine if there are hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "Insufficient code details provided for a thorough step-by-step analysis. Cannot identify sources, sinks, or flows without code content. The prompt lacks the actual code fragment, making it impossible to evaluate suspicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of code content, no malicious behavior, anomalies, or security risks can be confirmed or ruled out. Further review of actual code is necessary to make any definitive assessment.",
