  "purpose": "Provide information about the default CA certificate bundle used by the requests module.",
  "sources": "requests.certs module, specifically the documentation string mentioning certifi package.",
  "sinks": "No actual data flow or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows present; the code merely contains a docstring and a module reference.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of what appears to be obfuscated or placeholder text (e.g., 'rkzfIAOQiqULbZztmnrGEtHAvRppYSKt.g.', 'BnGoHIvFmARLgAVaBEbfTDGHXNNJbWVN') which does not correspond to legitimate code or documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a docstring describing the certifi package and the default CA bundle used by requests. However, it contains unusual strings that look like obfuscated or placeholder text, which is suspicious and indicates potential tampering or obfuscation. The actual executable code is minimal, and no malicious functions or data handling are present. The placeholder strings could be attempts at hiding malicious intent or data, but without further context, they do not perform any harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be mostly documentation with some suspicious placeholder text. No active malicious behavior is evident. The presence of obfuscated-like strings warrants caution, but there is no direct evidence of malware or malicious data flow in this fragment.",
