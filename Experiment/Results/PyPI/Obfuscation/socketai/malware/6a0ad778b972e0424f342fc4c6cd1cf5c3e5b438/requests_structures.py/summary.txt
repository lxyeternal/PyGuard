  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign, heavily obfuscated utility classes for internal data handling. There is no evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious data flows. The obfuscation alone does not imply malicious intent. The current malware score should remain at 0, with a high obfuscation score (~0.75) and a low security risk (~0.2)."
