  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python requests library documentation snippets for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Embedded variable names, function calls, and comments within the code snippets.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leakage points such as network requests, embedded data, or obfuscated variables that could hide malicious payloads.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., URLs, payloads) through request functions; obfuscated variables may mask malicious code execution or data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of highly obfuscated variable names, embedded nonsensical text, and formatting artifacts that are unusual in documentation snippets.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets are primarily benign documentation demonstrating the requests library usage. The only notable anomaly is in Report 2, where obfuscated variable names suggest suspicious obfuscation, raising a moderate concern. The other reports contain straightforward examples with no suspicious patterns. The scores assigned in the reports are generally appropriate, with the obfuscation in Report 2 justifying a higher obfuscated score. No active malicious code or malicious intent is evident. The security risk remains very low across all reports.",
  "conclusion": "The overall code snippets are benign, with the only suspicion arising from obfuscated variable names in Report 2. The scores reflect this suspicion accurately. No evidence of malware or malicious behavior is present. Minor adjustments could be made to the malware score in Report 2 to lower it slightly, but current scores are reasonable given the context.",
