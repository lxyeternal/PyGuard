{
  "purpose": "This code provides documentation and usage examples for the 'requests' HTTP library in Python, including basic GET and POST request usage.",
  "sources": "The code sources include the 'requests' module import and the provided example usage with URLs, payloads, and method calls.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the execution of HTTP requests via requests.get() and requests.post(), which send data over the network; however, these are standard usage examples.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., URLs, payloads) flows into requests.get() and requests.post() functions; these functions send data over the network, potentially leading to data leakage if untrusted data is used maliciously.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code appears to be standard documentation and usage examples for the requests library. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of descriptive comments, example usage snippets, and licensing information for the requests library. All code is straightforward and uses standard library functions. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious network activity embedded within the code snippet. The examples demonstrate typical HTTP request patterns without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is standard documentation and usage examples for the requests library. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. The code is safe and intended for educational or illustrative purposes.",
