  "purpose": "Documentation and usage example for the Requests HTTP library in Python.",
  "sources": "User input is indirectly involved when calling requests methods with URLs and payloads; no explicit input sources in the code snippet itself.",
  "sinks": "Requests library methods that send data over the network, potentially leading to data leakage if untrusted data is used maliciously.",
  "flows": "Data from user-defined variables (such as payloads or URLs) flows into network request functions, which transmit data externally.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious patterns are observed; the code is a straightforward usage example with no embedded or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code demonstrates basic usage of the 'requests' library, showing GET and POST requests with user-supplied URLs and payloads. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The code does not perform any insecure operations, nor does it contain obfuscated or malicious code. It appears to be a simple documentation snippet or tutorial example.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign usage example of the 'requests' library, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply shows how to perform GET and POST requests in Python.",
