{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package with additional functionality that involves downloading files from remote servers and executing system commands, potentially maliciously.",
  "sources": "The code reads version information from a '__version__.py' file, reads the README.md file, and retrieves files from remote URLs via HTTP requests.",
  "sinks": "The code executes system commands using subprocess.Popen, downloads and writes files to disk, and moves/deletes files. It also executes downloaded scripts or batch files, which can be malicious.",
  "flows": "Version info read -> setup configuration -> remote requests to download files -> writing files to disk -> executing downloaded files via system commands.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically downloads files from suspicious IP addresses, writes them to disk, and executes them without validation. It performs system modifications and attempts to escalate privileges by running commands with 'shell=True' and moving files around. The hardcoded IP addresses and execution of downloaded content are suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script is a setup configuration that includes typical package metadata but also contains code that fetches data from hardcoded remote URLs and executes or manipulates files on the local system. It attempts to install the 'requests' library if not present, then downloads files from specific IP addresses, writes them locally, and executes them using system commands. The use of subprocess with 'shell=True', moving files, and deleting files after execution are common tactics in malicious scripts. The code also performs administrative system checks and attempts to run commands that could lead to privilege escalation or malicious payload execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious due to its behavior of downloading, executing remote files, and manipulating the filesystem with elevated permissions. The remote IP addresses and execution flow strongly suggest malicious intent or a supply chain attack vector.",
