{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, primarily used to configure package metadata and installation behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the filesystem (e.g., README.md, kotko.txt), and makes HTTP GET requests to external URLs (https://api.ipify.org and https://kotko.org). It also reads environment information via os.uname() and the current file path.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows into URL requests, base64 encoding, and writing to a file ('bykotko.txt'). It also performs network calls with potentially sensitive info (IP address, hostname, path). The requests to external URLs can be used to exfiltrate data.",
  "flows": "The code retrieves the public IP address and system hostname, encodes this info in base64, and sends it via a GET request to an external server (kotko.org). It also writes 'kotko' into a file 'bykotko.txt'.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs network requests to external services to send system info, which is unusual for a setup script. The URL 'kotko.org' and the use of base64 encoding to obscure data flow are suspicious. The filename 'kotko.txt' and variable names are obfuscated or nonsensical, possibly hiding intent. The request to external URL with encoded system info could be used for tracking or exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The script is a custom install class that registers a cleanup function upon exit. The cleanup function, BvHbqCehVyQQteHfylTdxAXfzOKNoniy, writes 'kotko' to a file, retrieves the public IP address, hostname, and current directory, encodes this info in base64, and sends it via a GET request to 'https://kotko.org'. The URL used ('https://kotko.org?') and the data sent suggest potential data exfiltration or tracking. The code also constructs a string combining IP, hostname, and path, encoded in base64, and appends it to a URL parameter. These behaviors are atypical for a standard setup script and indicate malicious intent or data harvesting. The code's obfuscation, with variable names and URL choices, raises suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily a setup script but includes suspicious behavior: it collects system info, encodes it, and transmits it to an external domain, which is indicative of potential data exfiltration or tracking activity. The network requests and data handling are suspicious, especially given their placement in a setup process.",
