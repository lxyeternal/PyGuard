{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, with additional functions that perform network requests and file operations during installation.",
  "sources": "Requests to external domains (api.ipify.org and kotko.org), reading the current script's directory, and writing to a file (bykotko.txt).",
  "sinks": "Writing to 'bykotko.txt', sending data via HTTP GET requests with encoded information, and executing code during installation.",
  "flows": "Data is gathered from the network and environment, encoded, and then sent via HTTP GET requests during the package installation process.",
  "anomalies": "The function BvHbqCehVyQQteHfylTdxAXfzOKNoniy executes during package installation, performing network requests to potentially tracking or data exfiltration domains, writing to a file, and encoding system info in Base64 without any clear legitimate reason.",
  "analysis": "The script is primarily a setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It defines a custom install class that registers a function to run at exit, which gathers system and network info, encodes it, and transmits it to an external domain (kotko.org). The code uses requests to obtain the public IP address and system hostname, then encodes this data and sends it via a GET request. The writing of 'kotko' to a file during exit and the use of seemingly obfuscated variable names suggest an attempt to hide behavior. This pattern resembles data collection or potential exfiltration behavior embedded within an ostensibly benign setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains suspicious behavior where, during package installation, it collects system and network information and transmits it to an external server without user consent. These actions indicate malicious or at least privacy-invasive intent, which is unusual for a typical setup script. The overall design suggests potential malicious intent, likely for tracking or exfiltration purposes.",
