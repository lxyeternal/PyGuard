  "purpose": "This script appears to be a setup configuration for a Python package, with some additional functions that perform network requests and write to a file during installation.",
  "sources": "Requests to 'https://api.ipify.org' and 'https://kotko.org', file operations on 'bykotko.txt', reading the current file path and system info.",
  "sinks": "Network requests that send system info and IP address, writing to 'bykotko.txt', base64 encoding of data and sending it as part of a URL parameter.",
  "flows": "The function 'BvHbqCehVyQQteHfylTdxAXfzOKNoniy' collects system info, encodes it, and transmits it via a GET request to a remote server. It also writes 'kotko' into a local file. This occurs during package installation via atexit registered callback.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs hidden data exfiltration: it collects IP address, hostname, and file path info, encodes it, and sends it to a suspicious domain ('kotko.org') without user consent. It writes arbitrary data to a file 'bykotko.txt'. The use of obfuscated variable names and the network transmission during installation are suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with standard setup imports but then defines a custom install class that registers a function to run at exit. This function gathers system information and IP address, encodes this data, and sends it to an external server. The data collection involves requests to 'api.ipify.org' and 'kotko.org', and the data sent includes IP, hostname, and path, all encoded in base64. The purpose appears to be covert data exfiltration during package installation. The writing of 'kotko' into a file and the URL encoding further suggests malicious intent. All other setup-related code appears legitimate, but the embedded network activity is malicious, especially since it occurs silently during package install.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior intended for covertly collecting and exfiltrating system and network information during package installation. The obfuscated variable names and hidden network requests indicate malicious intent, constituting a security threat.",
