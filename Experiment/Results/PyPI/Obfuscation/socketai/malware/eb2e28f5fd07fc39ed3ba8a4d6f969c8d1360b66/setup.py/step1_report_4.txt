  ],
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a setup script with obfuscated variable names. It imports modules for packaging, network communication, and filesystem access. A custom install class registers a function to run during installation that gathers system info, encodes it, and sends it to an external server ('kotko.org') via an HTTP GET request. It also writes a string 'kotko' to a local file 'bykotko.txt'. These actions are suspicious because they transmit system information without user consent, which can be used for tracking or data exfiltration. The obfuscation and network activity during package setup are typical indicators of malicious behavior or at least undesirable privacy violations.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs potentially malicious activity by collecting and transmitting system data to external servers during package installation. Its obfuscation and network behavior suggest malicious intent or privacy invasion. The code should be treated as suspicious and potentially harmful, especially if the source is untrusted.",
