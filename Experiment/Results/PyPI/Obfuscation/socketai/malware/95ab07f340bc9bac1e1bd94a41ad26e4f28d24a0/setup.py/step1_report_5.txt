  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, defining dependencies and package info.",
  "sources": "The 'setup' function from setuptools, the 'install_requires' list.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no data leaks, network connections, or malicious actions are evident.",
  "flows": "The setup configuration loads dependencies; no data flows from external untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The package name 'das2v2to4t2d9bqj' appears obfuscated or nonsensical, which could be suspicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setuptools functions to define package metadata and dependencies. The dependencies listed are common libraries (browser_cookie3, discordwebhook, robloxpy, requests) and do not inherently indicate malicious intent. The package name appears obfuscated, which may be intended to hide the purpose, but on its own, this is not conclusive. No code execution, network activity, or suspicious logic is present in this snippet. There are no signs of malware, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with an obfuscated package name but no apparent malicious behavior or security risks. The presence of obfuscated package name warrants cautious further review if additional code exists, but based on this snippet alone, no malicious activity is detected.",
