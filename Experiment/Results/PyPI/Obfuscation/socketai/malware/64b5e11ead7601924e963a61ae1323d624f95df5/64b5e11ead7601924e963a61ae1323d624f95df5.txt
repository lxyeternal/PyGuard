      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation and covert execution tactics typical of malicious scripts. The use of encoded PowerShell commands triggered conditionally during setup indicates a high likelihood of malicious activity. Scores assigned are consistent with this suspicion. Further decoding of the PowerShell payload is recommended to confirm intent."
