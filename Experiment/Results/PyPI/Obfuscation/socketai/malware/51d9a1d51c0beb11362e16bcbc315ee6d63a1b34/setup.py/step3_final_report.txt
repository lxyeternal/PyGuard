{
  "purpose": "This setup script conditionally decrypts and executes a payload during installation on Windows systems, using obfuscated variable names and encrypted data to conceal its behavior.",
  "sources": "Encrypted payload strings, hardcoded Fernet key, environment check (os.name == 'nt')",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing decrypted code",
  "flows": "On Windows, decrypts payload with Fernet and executes via exec()",
  "anomalies": "Use of encrypted payloads, obfuscated variable names, runtime decryption and execution during setup, conditional on OS",
  "analysis": "The code employs obfuscation and encrypted payloads to hide malicious intent. During installation on Windows, it decrypts and executes code dynamically, which is a common tactic for malicious backdoors or payloads. The use of exec() on decrypted data, combined with hardcoded cryptographic keys, indicates an attempt to conceal malicious behavior. The pattern matches known malicious supply chain attack techniques, with high suspicion justified by the encrypted payload and conditional execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates high malicious potential, with encrypted payload decryption and execution during setup on Windows. The obfuscation and runtime code execution strongly suggest malicious intent, warranting classification as highly suspicious or malicious.",
