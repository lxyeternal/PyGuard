{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package with obfuscated code that conditionally executes decrypted content during installation.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools, os, requests, and fernet; execution of decrypted code within the custom install command.",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of decrypted code via exec, which may execute malicious payloads, especially given the use of Fernet decryption and conditional execution on Windows.",
  "flows": "During installation, if on Windows, the code decrypts a payload and executes it via exec, creating a source-to-sink path from setup phase to potential malicious code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of heavily obfuscated variable names, encrypted payloads, conditional code execution based on OS, and execution of decrypted code at install time. The decrypted content is not visible, indicating obfuscation and potential malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package. It uses non-descriptive variable names and includes encrypted payloads decrypted during the install process if the OS is Windows. The decrypted code is executed directly via exec, which is a significant security concern. The code appears intentionally obfuscated, with encrypted strings and conditional execution, suggesting malicious intent or backdoor capabilities. The presence of setup requirements for 'fernet' and 'requests' combined with the execution of decrypted code during installation indicates a high-risk behavior typical of malicious package supply chain compromises.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious behavior due to obfuscation, use of decrypted payloads, and execution during installation. It is likely designed to run malicious code on Windows systems when installed, representing a significant security risk.",
