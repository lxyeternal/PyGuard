  "purpose": "Set up a Python package with metadata and potentially execute a hidden PowerShell command.",
  "sources": "The script reads the file system to check for 'tahg' and executes a PowerShell command via subprocess if the directory does not exist.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen call executes a PowerShell encoded command which may run arbitrary code on the host system.",
  "flows": "Code checks for 'tahg' directory -> If not found, executes a hidden PowerShell command -> No further data flows observed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64-encoded PowerShell command with hidden window style, attempting to run potentially malicious payload. The code suppresses errors silently. The setup call is straightforward but the presence of encoded command is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by importing setup tools and attempts to import subprocess and os modules. It checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists. If not, it executes a PowerShell command encoded in base64, which is run via subprocess.Popen with hidden window flags. The PowerShell command is base64-encoded, suggesting obfuscation, and is likely designed to run additional code or download payloads. The setup function is called with package metadata but does not contain any malicious code directly. The use of encoded commands and suppression of errors are common in malicious scripts to hide activity and avoid detection. The script's intent appears suspicious, especially due to the hidden PowerShell execution, which is often used for malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution that could run arbitrary malicious commands, indicating high malicious potential. The setup metadata appears benign, but the presence of the encoded command and silent error handling suggest malicious intent or at least malicious behavior potential.",
