  "purpose": "The code checks for the existence of the 'tahg' directory and, if absent, executes an encoded PowerShell command silently with hidden window flags during package setup.",
  "sources": "Filesystem check for 'tahg' directory; execution of base64-encoded PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.Popen executing the encoded PowerShell command with hidden window flags.",
  "flows": "Directory existence check -> conditional execution of encoded PowerShell command during setup.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64-encoded, obfuscated PowerShell command run silently and with no window; silent error handling suppressing failures; execution during package setup which can be stealthy.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a directory check and, if missing, runs an obfuscated PowerShell command silently, which is suspicious. The command is encoded, hiding its purpose, and errors are suppressed, preventing detection. Multiple reports correctly identify this pattern as indicative of malicious or sabotage activity. The high obfuscation and stealthy execution pattern justify elevated malware and risk scores. The scores across reports are consistent with the observed behavior, with malware scores around 0.75-0.8, obfuscation scores around 0.8-0.9, and overall risk scores around 0.75-0.8. The pattern aligns with common tactics in malicious supply chain attacks or backdoors, warranting caution and further decoding of the payload for confirmation.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious intent due to obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during setup, with silent error handling and stealthy behavior. The assigned scores are justified and indicate a high security risk, warranting further investigation or removal from supply chain use.",
