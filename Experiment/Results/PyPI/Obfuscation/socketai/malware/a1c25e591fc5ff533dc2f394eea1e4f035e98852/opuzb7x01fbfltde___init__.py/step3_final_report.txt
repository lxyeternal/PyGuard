{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform benign data handling, utility functions, or standard processing without malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, user input, or function parameters.",
  "sinks": "Outputs to network connections, files, or environment variables, but no untrusted data flows are suspicious.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) to sinks (outputs) without suspicious transformations or injections.",
  "anomalies": "Minor obfuscation (score 0.2) in some reports; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code constructs identified.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate no malicious payloads or suspicious behaviors. The low malware scores (0 or 0.1) align with the absence of malicious activity. Obfuscation is minimal, and confidence levels are high (0.75–0.9). The security risk scores (0.2) are conservative but justified given limited evidence. Limited code details prevent definitive conclusions, but overall, the assessments are consistent and cautious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly likely benign with minimal obfuscation and no malicious indicators. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary; ongoing monitoring is recommended if further code details become available.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.2,
