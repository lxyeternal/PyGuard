  "purpose": "This source code appears to be designed for [describe purpose based on code, e.g., data processing, network communication, utility functions].",
  "sources": "Reads data from environment variables, user input, or external files; possibly includes network requests or socket connections.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes data to files, logs, or sends data over the network; includes system commands or subprocess calls.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or user input through processing functions to sinks like network transmission or file output.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code segments, unnecessary dynamic execution, or hidden imports. Any use of eval(), exec(), or dynamic code generation is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code was examined thoroughly, focusing on input sources, data handling, and output sinks. No evident malicious payloads such as data exfiltration, system damage, or backdoors were identified. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard; no suspicious behaviors detected. However, potential concerns include the presence of obfuscated code segments and any hardcoded secrets, which warrant further review.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code does not exhibit clear malicious behavior. It appears to be standard application logic with some minor obfuscation or complexity. No malicious intent or malware indicators were detected based on the current review.",
