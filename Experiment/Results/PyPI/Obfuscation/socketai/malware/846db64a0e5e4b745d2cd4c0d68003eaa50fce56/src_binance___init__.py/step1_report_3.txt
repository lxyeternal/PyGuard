{
  "purpose": "The code executes system commands to download and run potentially malicious scripts from external sources.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from external URLs via PowerShell and curl commands, downloading files to the local system.",
  "sinks": "The downloaded files are executed directly on the system, and shell commands are invoked to run potentially malicious scripts.",
  "flows": "External URLs -> downloaded files -> execution of these files via system commands",
  "anomalies": "Use of PowerShell and curl to download and execute remote scripts without validation; the scripts are fetched from untrusted sources and immediately executed, which is suspicious. No validation or verification is performed on the downloaded files.",
  "analysis": "The code uses os.system() to run PowerShell commands that download a batch file from a GitHub URL and execute it, indicating potential malicious activity such as remote code execution. It also pipes a curl command that downloads and runs a shell script, which could be malware. Both commands bypass user interaction and verification, and the URLs point to scripts that may perform malicious actions. The use of obfuscated commands and direct execution of remote content without validation is highly suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing remote scripts without validation, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent. It appears to be part of a malicious payload aimed at executing remote code on the host system.",
