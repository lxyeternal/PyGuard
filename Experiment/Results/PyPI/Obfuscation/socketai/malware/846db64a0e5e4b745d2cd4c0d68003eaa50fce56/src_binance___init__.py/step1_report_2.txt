  "purpose": "Execute remote scripts and download files from a GitHub repository, then run them on the local system.",
  "sources": "os.system() calls executing PowerShell commands and curl commands that fetch scripts from the internet.",
  "sinks": "Downloading and executing a batch file and a shell script from external sources; executing downloaded files directly.",
  "flows": "Input data from URLs flows into downloaded files, which are then executed directly via system calls.",
  "anomalies": "Use of PowerShell to download and execute a batch file, and piping a curl command directly into bash without validation. Hardcoded URL and filename, indicative of malicious activity. Obfuscated or suspicious command chaining.",
  "analysis": "The code uses os.system() to run a PowerShell command that downloads a batch script from a GitHub URL, saves it to a temporary file with a .bat extension, executes it, and then deletes the file. The second os.system() call fetches a shell script from GitHub via curl and pipes it directly into bash for execution. Both actions involve retrieving scripts from an external source and executing them without any validation or sanitization, which poses a high security risk. The URLs are hardcoded and point to potentially malicious scripts, consistent with malicious payload delivery. The code's structure and behavior strongly suggest malicious intent, likely to compromise or control the host system.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing external scripts from GitHub without validation, indicating it is likely part of a supply chain attack or malicious payload delivery. The pattern of fetching and executing remote scripts is characteristic of malware or backdoor activity.",
