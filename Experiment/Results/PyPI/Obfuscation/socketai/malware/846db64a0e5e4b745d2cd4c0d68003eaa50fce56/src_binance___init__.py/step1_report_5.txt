{
  "purpose": "The code executes remote scripts and downloads files from an external source, likely to run potentially malicious payloads.",
  "sources": "os.system calls executing PowerShell commands and curl commands that fetch scripts from a remote URL.",
  "sinks": "Execution of downloaded scripts and files via PowerShell, which can lead to arbitrary code execution, system compromise, or malware installation.",
  "flows": "Remote URLs are fetched and saved as temporary files, then executed directly in PowerShell, indicating data flow from external sources to system execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of PowerShell to download and execute a batch file, and curl piping to a script, both from the same suspicious URL; dynamic execution of remote content; obfuscated or suspicious command chaining.",
  "analysis": "The code runs a PowerShell command that downloads a batch file from a GitHub URL and executes it, then deletes the temporary file. It also uses curl to fetch and execute a shell script from the same URL. These actions are typical of malware or remote code execution tactics. The URLs point to raw content on GitHub, which may be malicious. The use of system calls to execute remote scripts indicates an intent to run external code potentially without user consent. The combined use of PowerShell and curl suggests an attempt to evade detection and execute arbitrary commands.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing remote scripts, indicating likely malicious intent and significant security risk. It appears designed to perform unauthorized system modifications or malware installation.",
