  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for distribution, reading README.md for long description.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file; uses setuptools.setup() parameters.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sinks or external data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "Input from README.md flows into long_description; no malicious data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a non-standard, obfuscated dictionary key 'wdDrYIXKPmrvSYBRFhAGNUajmtjNBhlw' with nested URL, which is not a recognized parameter for setuptools.setup().",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with an unusual, suspicious key inserted as a parameter. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks are evident. The key's nonsensical name and embedded URL suggest obfuscation or malicious intent, but static analysis shows no active malicious behavior. The key is likely ignored by setuptools but could be used for obfuscation or as a backdoor vector if interpreted maliciously. The scores assigned in reports are low to moderate, reflecting suspicion of obfuscation but no confirmed malware. The anomaly warrants further investigation, such as dynamic analysis or source review, to determine if the key is benign or malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears primarily benign with a suspicious, non-standard parameter key that could be used for obfuscation or malicious purposes. No active malicious activity is detected, but the anomaly warrants further review. The current low malware and risk scores are appropriate, with a moderate suspicion level due to the anomalous key.",
