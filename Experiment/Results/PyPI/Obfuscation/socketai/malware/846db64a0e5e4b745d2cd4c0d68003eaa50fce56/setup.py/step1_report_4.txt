  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leakage or malicious effects are evident.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' -> Passing metadata to setuptools.setup()",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a suspicious dictionary 'wdDrYIXKPmrvSYBRFhAGNUajmtjNBhlw' containing a URL, which appears unusual and potentially obfuscated or malicious. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily reads a Markdown file for the long description and calls setuptools.setup() with package metadata. The only unusual element is the non-standard dictionary 'wdDrYIXKPmrvSYBRFhAGNUajmtjNBhlw' which is not a recognized argument for setuptools.setup() and appears to contain a 'Bug Tracker' URL. This may be an obfuscation or an attempt to hide some malicious intent, but as it is not connected to any code execution or network activity, it is not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials, code injection, or malicious code present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script with an anomalous but harmless-looking dictionary entry. There are no clear signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
