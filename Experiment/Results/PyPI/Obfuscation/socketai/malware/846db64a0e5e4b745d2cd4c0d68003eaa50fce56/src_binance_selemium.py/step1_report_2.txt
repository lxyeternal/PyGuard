{
  "purpose": "Execute remote scripts and download files from external sources, possibly for malicious purposes such as malware installation or system compromise.",
  "sources": "os.system calls executing PowerShell and curl commands to download and run external scripts/files.",
  "sinks": "Execution of downloaded files and scripts that can run arbitrary code on the system.",
  "flows": "os.system calls (sources) lead to execution of downloaded files/scripts (sinks), which may perform malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of PowerShell commands to download and execute a batch file from a suspicious URL, as well as piping a download directly into bash. The function name appears obfuscated or nonsensical. No input validation or error handling is present.",
  "analysis": "The code uses os.system to run a PowerShell command that downloads a batch script from a GitHub URL and executes it, then deletes the temporary file. The second os.system command pipes a script directly from a URL into bash, which also executes code from an external source. These actions suggest an intent to execute remote code without verification. The function 'ONkmVanUelFNSzVyIfcVnPbwUSGBGqJB' is a no-op and appears to be obfuscated or meaningless, indicating possible attempt to hide malicious intent or code obfuscation. The use of hardcoded URLs and direct execution is highly suspicious, potentially leading to malware infection or system compromise.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing remote scripts without verification, which could lead to system compromise or malware infection. The obfuscated function name and direct execution of remote code increase suspicion of malicious intent.",
