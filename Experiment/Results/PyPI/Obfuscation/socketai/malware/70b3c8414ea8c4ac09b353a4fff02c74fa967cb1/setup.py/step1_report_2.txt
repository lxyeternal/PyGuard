  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, with an embedded attempt to run hidden PowerShell command.",

  "sinks": "subprocess.Popen executing encoded PowerShell command",
  "flows": "os.path.exists check -> subprocess.Popen execution if condition met",
  "anomalies": "Encoded PowerShell command being executed silently; no validation of the command; use of try-except without logging; suspiciously hidden execution",
  "analysis": "The code first checks for the existence of a directory or file named 'tahg'. If it doesn't exist, it attempts to run a PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with the window hidden and encoded content. The encoded command appears to be a Base64-encoded PowerShell script, which is often used to obfuscate malicious commands. The script does not validate or log this activity, and the try-except blocks suppress errors silently. The setup call seems benign and is standard, but the embedded command execution is suspicious and potentially malicious, designed to run hidden PowerShell commands potentially downloaded or executed from remote sources.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains suspicious behavior with hidden execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command, which could be malicious. The rest of the setup code appears benign. The hidden encoded command warrants further investigation, as it may be part of a supply chain attack or malware distribution.",
