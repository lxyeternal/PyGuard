  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated, and stealthily executed PowerShell command during setup, likely used to download or run malicious payloads. The use of encoded commands, hidden execution, and error suppression indicates malicious intent, posing a significant security threat in supply chain contexts. The package should be treated as malicious or compromised."
