{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that includes custom installation behavior, potentially executing encrypted code during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables, imports modules ('requests', 'fernet'), and decrypts and executes encrypted code within the 'install' class during installation.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decrypted code via 'exec', which may execute malicious or unintended code; potential network activity via 'requests' if used in the decrypted payload.",
  "flows": "The package setup invokes the custom 'install' class, which may decrypt and execute code during installation, potentially accessing environment info and executing arbitrary code.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of encrypted payload and execution of 'exec' on decrypted data; hardcoded encrypted key and ciphertext; obfuscated variable names; code that executes differently based on OS; no clear documentation of the decrypted code's purpose.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup modules, defines obfuscated variable names containing strings, and defines a custom install class that, on Windows ('nt'), imports 'requests' and 'fernet'. It then decrypts an encrypted string using 'Fernet' with a hardcoded key and executes the decrypted code. The 'setup' function is called with package metadata and registers the custom install class. The presence of encrypted code and execution via 'exec', along with dynamic imports, is suspicious, especially since the decrypted content is not shown but could contain malicious payloads. The script seems designed to run code during installation, which may compromise systems.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains encrypted payload execution during package installation, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. The use of obfuscation, encrypted code, and dynamic execution suggests possible malicious intent or backdoor functionality. While the actual decrypted code is not visible, this pattern is typical of malicious behavior aiming to conceal harmful code.",
