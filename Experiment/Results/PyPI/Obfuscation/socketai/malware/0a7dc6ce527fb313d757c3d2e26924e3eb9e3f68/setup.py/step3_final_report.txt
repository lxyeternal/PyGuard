{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script that, during installation on Windows, decrypts a hardcoded Fernet-encrypted payload and executes it via exec(), obfuscated with variable names and embedded encrypted strings.",
  "sources": "The encrypted payload and Fernet key embedded as constants; the code reads no external input.",
  "sinks": "The decrypted payload executed via exec() on Windows systems.",
  "flows": "On Windows, the code decrypts the hardcoded payload and passes it directly to exec(), executing potentially malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of encrypted payloads, obfuscated variable names, conditional execution only on Windows, and execution of decrypted code during install.",
  "analysis": "The code pattern involves decrypting a hardcoded encrypted payload and executing it during package installation on Windows, which is a classic indicator of malicious intent. The obfuscation and embedded encrypted strings are designed to conceal malicious behavior. No external inputs influence this process, but the pattern itself is highly suspicious. The use of exec() on decrypted data without validation is a significant security risk, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution. The high degree of obfuscation and encrypted payloads further support malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.75-0.9, obfuscated ~0.8-1, risk ~0.75-0.9) are consistent with this pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by decrypting and executing hidden payloads during installation, especially on Windows. The obfuscation and encrypted payloads strongly suggest malicious intent. The high malware, obfuscation, and risk scores are justified and indicate a high probability of malicious activity.",
