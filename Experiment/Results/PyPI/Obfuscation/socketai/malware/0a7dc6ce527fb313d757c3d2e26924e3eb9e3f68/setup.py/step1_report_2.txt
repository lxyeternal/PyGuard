{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a custom installation command for a Python package, possibly to execute malicious code during installation.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, import statements, the exec() function with decrypted payload, and code within the custom install class.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing decrypted code, importing potentially malicious modules (requests, fernet), network requests and decryption in decrypted payload.",
  "flows": "During package installation, the custom install class runs, which conditionally decrypts and executes code if on Windows, leading to potential execution of malicious payload.",
  "anomalies": "Encrypted payload within Fernet decrypt, dynamic code execution via exec(), obfuscated variable names, suspiciously long and random string constants, the presence of hardcoded decryption key, code only executes on Windows, potential covert behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code uses obfuscated variable names and encrypted strings to hide its true behavior. During installation, if on Windows, it decrypts a payload and executes it via exec(), which is a significant security concern. The payload itself, once decrypted, could contain malicious commands or behavior. The package metadata and setup configuration look typical, but the custom installation class introduces a malicious capability. The import of requests and Fernet, along with the decrypted code execution, strongly suggest malicious intent. The code appears designed to deliver malicious payloads covertly during installation, especially on Windows systems.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior evidenced by encrypted payload decryption and execution during installation. It aims to run potentially harmful code on Windows systems, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent. The package should be considered unsafe for use.",
