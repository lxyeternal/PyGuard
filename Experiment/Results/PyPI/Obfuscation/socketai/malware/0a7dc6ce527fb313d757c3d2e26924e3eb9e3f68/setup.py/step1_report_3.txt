{
  "purpose": "The script appears to define a custom installation command that, on Windows systems, decrypts and executes a Fernet-encrypted payload.",
  "sources": "The code reads the environment (os.name) and includes hardcoded encrypted data within the Fernet decryption call.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the decrypted code via exec(), which could run arbitrary malicious code.",
  "flows": "Environment check -> decryption of payload -> execution via exec() during installation process.",
  "anomalies": "The use of encrypted payloads and dynamic execution in an installation script is suspicious. The code is obfuscated with non-descriptive variable names and encrypted data, which can hide malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code checks if the operating system is Windows ('nt') and, if so, imports 'requests' and 'Fernet'. It then decrypts a hardcoded Fernet key and encrypted data, executing the resulting code via exec(). The payload is encrypted, which is often used to conceal malicious behavior. The use of a custom install command suggests an attempt to run hidden code during package installation. The code's obfuscation and dynamic execution are common tactics in malicious packages to evade detection.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains obfuscated code that decrypts and executes arbitrary code during installation on Windows systems, indicating malicious behavior. The use of encrypted payloads and dynamic execution strongly suggests intent to hide malicious actions, such as installing backdoors or executing harmful code.",
