      "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by decrypting and executing hidden payloads during installation, especially on Windows. The obfuscation and encrypted payloads strongly suggest malicious intent. The high malware, obfuscation, and risk scores are justified and indicate a high probability of malicious activity."
