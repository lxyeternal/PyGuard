{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package that, upon installation, writes a remote access script to disk and executes it, potentially establishing remote control over the system.",
  "sources": "The script reads or creates files such as 'remote-access.py' and reads/writes to the filesystem and network sockets. It also reads environment variables for user directories.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'subprocess.Popen' to run the remote access script, opening network sockets for remote command execution, writing to files in user directories, and executing system commands via subprocess.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves writing a malicious remote access payload ('YghCMklHxzjDGsHfvKtReFjqimdQVVOg') to disk, then executing it via subprocess, and establishing a socket connection to a hardcoded IP address (120.76.194.25). The remote script itself contains reverse shell capabilities that connect back to the attacker-controlled server.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variable and function names, the embedding of a large block of code (YghCMklHxzjDGsHfvKtReFjqimdQVVOg) that opens reverse shells, writing 'remote-access.py' in the installation process, and hardcoded IP addresses. The code ignores security best practices by executing arbitrary shell commands and establishing persistent network connections to external IPs.",
  "analysis": "The code performs multiple suspicious activities: it writes a potentially malicious remote access script during package installation, then executes it to open a reverse shell to a hardcoded IP address, which can be used for remote control. The embedded code includes functions for Windows and Linux remote shells, indicating malicious intent. The obfuscated style and hardcoded IP suggest malicious backdoor behavior. This behavior aligns with typical remote access trojans (RATs), facilitating unauthorized control over affected systems. The use of threading, subprocesses, and network sockets demonstrates intent to maintain persistent access. The package's setup script automates these malicious steps during installation, which is highly suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code contains clear malicious intent: it installs a persistent remote backdoor, executing code that opens reverse shells to a specified IP address, and writes scripts that facilitate remote control. The obfuscated code, hardcoded IP, and network behavior indicate malicious activity designed for unauthorized system access.",
