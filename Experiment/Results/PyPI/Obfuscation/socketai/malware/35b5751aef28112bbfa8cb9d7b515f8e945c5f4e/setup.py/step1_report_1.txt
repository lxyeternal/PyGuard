{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a package that, upon installation, writes a remote access script to the user's filesystem and executes it, establishing a reverse shell connection to a specified IP address, potentially allowing remote control of the machine.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (os.path.expanduser), socket connection setup, file writing (open), subprocess invocation to run remote-access.py",
  "sinks": "Writing and executing 'remote-access.py', initiating reverse shell via subprocess.Popen, establishing socket connection to external IP (120.76.194.25), potential for remote code execution",
  "flows": "Code writes remote-access.py -> installs package -> upon installation, executes subprocess to run remote-access.py -> remote script connects back to external IP (120.76.194.25), establishing a remote access channel",
  "anomalies": "Embedded reverse shell code with hardcoded IP address, writing and executing remote-access.py during installation, obfuscated class and function names, no explicit user consent or security checks, potential persistence mechanism",
  "analysis": "The script contains a multi-part reverse shell payload embedded in a string variable. It is set to execute upon package installation, writing the payload to a file named 'remote-access.py' in the user's directory, then executing it. The payload creates a reverse shell that connects to a hardcoded IP address, potentially allowing remote control. The code employs obfuscated naming, which is often used to hide malicious intent. It does not include any user prompts or security measures, and automatically establishes an external connection, indicating malicious intent. The overall structure and embedded payload strongly suggest malicious behavior aimed at unauthorized remote access.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to facilitate unauthorized remote access to the machine by installing a reverse shell payload during package installation. It employs obfuscation and hardcoded IPs to conceal its malicious intent. This constitutes a high security risk and malicious behavior, indicating probable malware embedded within the package.",
