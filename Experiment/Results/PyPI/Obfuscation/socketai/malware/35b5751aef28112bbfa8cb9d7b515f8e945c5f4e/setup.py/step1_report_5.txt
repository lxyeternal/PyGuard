{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a Python package that, upon installation, writes a remote access script to disk and attempts to execute it, potentially allowing remote control of the host machine.",
  "sources": "The script reads system information (hostname, platform), and reads/writes files ('remote-access.py'). It also executes subprocess commands and opens network sockets to a hardcoded IP address.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include writing and executing 'remote-access.py', socket connections to a specific IP, and subprocess invocation to run the remote script. The remote script establishes reverse shells for Windows and Linux.",
  "flows": "The code writes a malicious Python script ('remote-access.py'), saves it to disk, then executes it via subprocess. The remote script opens a socket connection to a hardcoded IP address and establishes reverse shells, enabling remote control.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded IP address (120.76.194.25), creation and execution of a remote access script during installation, obfuscated variable and function names, and use of threading for socket communication. The code bypasses normal user controls and installs a persistent backdoor.",
  "analysis": "The script, during installation, writes a malicious script that creates a reverse shell connection to a fixed IP. It targets Windows and Linux systems by spawning command shells. The code uses obfuscated naming to conceal its intent. It downloads a script, saves it in a user directory, and executes it without user consent. The IP is hardcoded, indicating targeted or malicious activity. The reverse shell allows remote command execution, representing a serious security threat.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious and exhibits malicious behavior by installing a remote access backdoor during package installation. It communicates with a hardcoded IP, executes remote shells, and uses obfuscation to hide intent. The package should be considered malicious and unsafe.",
