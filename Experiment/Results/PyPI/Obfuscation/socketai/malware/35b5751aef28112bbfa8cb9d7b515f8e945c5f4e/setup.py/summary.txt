  "conclusion": "The code is a malicious backdoor embedding a reverse shell that executes during package installation, connecting to an attacker-controlled server. The obfuscation, hardcoded IP, and silent execution confirm its malicious nature. The scores assigned are appropriate, and the overall threat level is high. It should be flagged as malware and removed from distribution channels."
