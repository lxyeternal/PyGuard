{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a package that, when installed, writes a remote access script to disk and executes it, establishing a backdoor for remote control of the machine.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from socket connections, reads and writes files ('remote-access.py'), and accesses environment variables and system information.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'remote-access.py' as a subprocess, writing to disk, and network connections to a hardcoded IP address (120.76.194.25).",
  "flows": "The code writes a script to disk, then executes it; the script establishes a reverse shell that connects to a specific IP, allowing remote command execution.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of embedded malicious code that creates a persistent backdoor; hardcoded IP address; dynamic creation and execution of remote-access script; use of threading and subprocesses to establish a reverse shell; obfuscated variable names; code that runs upon installation without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The initial code includes a large string containing a reverse shell implementation that connects to a hardcoded IP address. The class extending 'install' writes this script to disk and executes it, which indicates malicious intent for remote control. The code uses obfuscated variable names and dynamically writes and runs code, making detection difficult. The network activity (connecting to a specific IP) and the ability to run arbitrary commands via the reverse shell constitute malicious behavior. These activities align with common backdoor functionalities, suggesting this package is designed for unauthorized remote access. No benign functionality or security testing purpose is evident; all actions point toward covert remote control setup.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code contains malicious backdoor functionality, establishing a remote connection to an external IP and executing arbitrary commands, which is typical malicious behavior. The code is obfuscated and installs itself silently, indicating an intent to evade detection and gain unauthorized access. This package should be considered highly malicious and unsafe for use.",
