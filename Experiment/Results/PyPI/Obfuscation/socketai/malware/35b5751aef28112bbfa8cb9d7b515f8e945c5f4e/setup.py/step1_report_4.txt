{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for creating a Python package that, upon installation, writes and executes a remote access script which establishes a reverse shell connection to a specific IP address.",
  "sources": "Reads include the embedded reverse shell script string (YghCMklHxzjDGsHfvKtReFjqimdQVVOg), and file operations such as opening, writing, renaming, and executing 'remote-access.py'. It also reads environment variables for user directories and platform info.",
  "sinks": "Execution of subprocess.Popen to run the 'remote-access.py' script, writing to and executing files in user directories, network socket connections to a hardcoded IP address (120.76.194.25) on port 20080, and potentially persistent background processes.",
  "flows": "The embedded script is written to 'remote-access.py' in user directories, then executed via subprocess. The script, when run, establishes a reverse shell connection to the specified IP, allowing remote command execution. The package installation process triggers this behavior.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded IP address for remote control, the script creates a reverse shell with both Windows and Linux support, writes executable code to user directories, and attempts to run it automatically during package installation. The naming conventions of variables and functions are obfuscated, and the code includes a long string with potential malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is designed to be part of a Python package that, upon installation, writes a reverse shell script to the user's directory and executes it. The embedded script connects back to a specific IP address, granting remote control. The reverse shell functions include code for both Windows and Linux, indicating deliberate malicious remote access capabilities. The package setup process triggers these actions automatically, suggesting intent for covert remote access. Obfuscated variable names and the embedding of malicious code within a seemingly legitimate setup script further point to malicious behavior. No benign functionality or legitimate purpose is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code contains embedded reverse shell functionality that connects to an external IP, executed during package installation. It is designed to create persistent remote access to the attacker's server. The code's obfuscation, hardcoded malicious IP, and automated execution strongly indicate malicious intent, qualifying as malware with high severity.",
