  "purpose": "Minimal setup script for a Python package, using static package name and version.",
  "sources": "The package name and version strings in the setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data inputs; no data leaks or external calls.",
  "flows": "None; static data used in setup(), no dynamic or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Suspiciously random or obfuscated package name 'ty2a3a6kjhoc5j44', which could be used to hide malicious intent, but no malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static setup script with no dynamic behavior, external data, or malicious logic. The only anomaly is the package name, which appears obfuscated or randomly generated. All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious code, with malware scores at 0. The obfuscation scores vary based on the suspicion about the package name, with some reports assigning high scores (up to 0.8). Given the minimal code and lack of malicious activity, the overall security risk is low (~0.1). The suspicion is solely based on the package name's appearance, not on code behavior. Scores are consistent with the analysis; no adjustments are necessary unless further context suggests malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a minimal setup script with an obfuscated package name. No malicious activity is detected. The high obfuscation score reflects the suspicious name, but malware and risk scores are appropriately low. Monitoring is recommended if used in broader supply chain contexts, but based solely on this code, it poses no security threat.",
