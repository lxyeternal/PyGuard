      "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a minimal setup script with an obfuscated package name. No malicious activity is detected. The high obfuscation score reflects the suspicious name, but malware and risk scores are appropriately low. Monitoring is recommended if used in broader supply chain contexts, but based solely on this code, it poses no security threat."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The analyzed code exhibits strong indicators of malicious activity, primarily covert data exfiltration and command-and-control behavior. Its heavy obfuscation, repeated network requests, and use of encoded payloads suggest it is designed for stealthy communication with an external server. The high obfuscation and network activity justify assigning a malware score of approximately 0.8, a security risk score around 0.85, and an obfuscation score of about 0.8. The code should be treated as highly suspicious and potentially malicious, warranting further investigation and caution in deployment."
