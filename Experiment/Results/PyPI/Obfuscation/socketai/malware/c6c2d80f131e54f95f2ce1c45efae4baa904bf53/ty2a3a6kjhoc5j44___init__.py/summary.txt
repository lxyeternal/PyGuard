  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code exhibits strong indicators of malicious activity, primarily covert data exfiltration and command-and-control behavior. Its heavy obfuscation, repeated network requests, and use of encoded payloads suggest it is designed for stealthy communication with an external server. The high obfuscation and network activity justify assigning a malware score of approximately 0.8, a security risk score around 0.85, and an obfuscation score of about 0.8. The code should be treated as highly suspicious and potentially malicious, warranting further investigation and caution in deployment."
