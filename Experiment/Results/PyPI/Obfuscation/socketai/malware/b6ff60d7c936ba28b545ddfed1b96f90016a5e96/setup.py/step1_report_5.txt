  "purpose": "Obfuscated code performing dynamic evaluation based on system version info, potentially executing hidden or malicious code.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, input strings with unicode and character transformations, encoded string constants embedded in variables.",
  "sinks": "eval() calls with dynamically constructed code from encoded strings, which may execute malicious payloads.",
  "flows": "Source sys.version_info and string data -> transformation functions -> eval() of reconstructed code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple obfuscated functions, extensive string transformations, and repeated dynamic eval() calls on strings with Unicode manipulations. Presence of highly obfuscated variable names and large encoded strings.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with conditional checks on Python version info, then defines obfuscated functions that manipulate strings and perform complex character shifts and concatenations, often involving eval() on the resulting code. The variables contain large encoded strings, likely encrypted or obfuscated payloads, which are decoded at runtime and executed via eval(). The obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and string manipulations strongly indicate an attempt to hide malicious behavior or payloads. The pattern is consistent with malicious obfuscation techniques designed to evade static analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code employs heavy obfuscation with dynamic code execution, likely to conceal malicious payloads or backdoors. The use of eval() on transformed strings and the extensive encoding suggest malicious intent and potential risk of executing harmful code when run.",
