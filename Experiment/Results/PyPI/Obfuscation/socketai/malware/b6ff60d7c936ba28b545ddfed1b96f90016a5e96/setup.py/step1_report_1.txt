    "Complex, unreadable code that decodes and executes code at runtime."
  ],
  "analysis": "The code begins by checking Python version info, then sets flags accordingly. It defines functions that perform obfuscated string manipulations involving character codes and indices, using large string literals. These functions construct code strings dynamically, which are then executed via eval(). The pattern is repeated, with conditional blocks that execute code only under specific version conditions. The usage of unicode conversions, modular arithmetic on character codes, and eval() indicates that the code is designed to hide malicious payloads or behavior. No explicit hardcoded credentials or network connections are observed, but the obfuscation and dynamic execution are typical signs of malicious intent. The structure suggests that the code aims to conceal its true purpose, likely executing hidden payloads at runtime, which poses significant security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly obfuscated, employs dynamic code generation and execution, and is designed to conceal its true intent. These characteristics strongly indicate malicious behavior, likely malicious payload execution. It should be considered dangerous and not used.",
