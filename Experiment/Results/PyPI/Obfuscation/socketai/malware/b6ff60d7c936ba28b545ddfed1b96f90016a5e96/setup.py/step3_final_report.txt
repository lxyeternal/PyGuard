{
  "purpose": "Detects obfuscated Python code that dynamically constructs and executes code via eval(), often based on runtime conditions, indicating potential malicious payloads.",
  "sources": "Large obfuscated string literals, version info checks, function definitions that manipulate strings and perform eval()",
  "sinks": "eval() calls on dynamically generated code, string manipulations leading to code execution",
  "flows": "Source strings (obfuscated payloads) undergo decryption/deobfuscation, then are evaluated via eval() to execute hidden code",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with repetitive characters, character shifting, unicode conversions, conditional execution based on sys.version_info, large encoded strings, dynamic code evaluation",
  "analysis": "The code heavily obfuscates its intent by constructing code snippets from long, encoded strings, performing character shifts, and evaluating the result with eval(). It uses version checks to conditionally execute code, a common tactic to evade static detection. The pattern of string manipulation, unicode conversions, and eval() indicates an attempt to conceal malicious payloads or backdoors. The scores assigned (malware ~0.85-0.9, obfuscated ~0.9-1, risk ~0.9) are consistent with this behavior. All reports correctly identify these indicators, and their reasoning aligns with the code's structure and intent.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is heavily obfuscated, employs dynamic code execution, and follows patterns typical of malicious payloads or backdoors. The high obfuscation and eval() usage justify high malware and risk scores. All reports are accurate and consistent; the code should be treated as malicious and avoided in supply chain contexts.",
