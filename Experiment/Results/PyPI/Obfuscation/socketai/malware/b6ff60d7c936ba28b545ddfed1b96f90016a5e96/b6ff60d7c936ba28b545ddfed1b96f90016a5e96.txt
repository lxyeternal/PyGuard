      "conclusion": "The analyzed code is heavily obfuscated, employs dynamic code execution, and follows patterns typical of malicious payloads or backdoors. The high obfuscation and eval() usage justify high malware and risk scores. All reports are accurate and consistent; the code should be treated as malicious and avoided in supply chain contexts."
