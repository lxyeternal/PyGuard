  "purpose": "Minimal setup script for package configuration using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static import of setuptools functions and static package name and version in setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; static data only.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated or randomly generated package name 'yz4si1u143kd03xb', which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with no dynamic or malicious behavior. The package name appears obfuscated but does not perform any malicious actions. No code injection, network activity, or data leaks are present. The obfuscated name warrants cautious review but is not inherently malicious. The malware score is appropriately zero, and the security risk is minimal. The scores across reports are consistent with this analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a minimal setup configuration. The obfuscated package name is suspicious but not malicious. No malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities are evident. The overall security risk is negligible, and the malware score should remain 0.",
