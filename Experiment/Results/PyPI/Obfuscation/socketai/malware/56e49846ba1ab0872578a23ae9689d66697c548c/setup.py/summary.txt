  "security_risk": 0.85,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential due to execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during setup. The behavior aligns with typical malware tactics such as concealment and stealth. Scores are justified and indicate a high security risk, warranting further decoding of the payload to confirm malicious intent."
