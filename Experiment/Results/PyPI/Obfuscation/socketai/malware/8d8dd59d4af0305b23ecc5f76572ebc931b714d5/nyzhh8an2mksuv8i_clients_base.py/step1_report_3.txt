  "sources": "Input parameters: event_type, event_data, timestamp, timeout, logger",
  "sinks": "Logging statements that could potentially expose sensitive data in logs",
  "flows": "Input data (event_data, event_type, timestamp) flows through validation and logging before being passed to an abstract send method",
  "anomalies": "Use of logging to output event details, but no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements an abstract client class with methods for validating event types and timestamps, and for sending events with detailed logging. It uses standard practices for input validation and logging. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hardcoded secrets. The logging of event data could potentially leak sensitive information if event_data contains confidential data, but this is a common practice in debugging and not inherently malicious. No obfuscated code, network connections, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, secure framework for event handling with no malicious intent or security risks detected. The use of logging should be managed carefully to prevent sensitive data leaks.",
