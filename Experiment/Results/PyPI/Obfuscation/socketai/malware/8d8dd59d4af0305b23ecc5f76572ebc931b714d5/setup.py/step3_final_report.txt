{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information (current directory, user, hostname) and exfiltrates it to an external server via an HTTP request during package setup.",
  "sources": "os.popen calls retrieving pwd, whoami, hostname; urllib.request.urlopen sending data",
  "sinks": "HTTP GET request to external URL with system info parameters",
  "flows": "os.popen() -> encode parameters -> urlopen() -> external server",
  "anomalies": "Immediate execution during import; data exfiltration without user consent; use of os.popen() for system info gathering; transmission of sensitive info to suspicious domain",
  "analysis": "The code performs covert data collection of sensitive system info using os.popen() calls and sends this data via an HTTP request to an external URL during module import, which is abnormal for a setup script. All reports correctly identify this malicious activity, noting the suspicious nature of executing shell commands and transmitting data without user knowledge. The scores assigned in the reports (malware and security risk) are consistent with the severity of this behavior. The malware score should be high (close to 0.9) due to the covert exfiltration, and the risk score likewise high. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, and the activity poses a significant privacy and security threat, justifying high scores. The behavior resembles reconnaissance and data theft, making it malicious. No false assumptions are present, and the scores align well with the observed activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, executing covert data exfiltration during package setup. The high malware and security risk scores are justified. The package should be flagged as highly suspicious or malicious, and users should avoid installing it.",
