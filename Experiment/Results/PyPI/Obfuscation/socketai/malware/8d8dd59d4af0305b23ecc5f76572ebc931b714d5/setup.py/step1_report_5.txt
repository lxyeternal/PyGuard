  "anomalies": [
    "Unusual code execution: gathering sensitive system info (current directory, user, hostname) and transmitting it to an external server without user consent.",
    "The remote URL ('http://pt.traktrain.com/RCE_PYTHON') appears suspicious, potentially used for remote command execution or data exfiltration."
  ],
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and executes shell commands to retrieve the current working directory, username, and hostname. It then encodes this information and sends it via an HTTP GET request to an external URL. This behavior resembles data exfiltration or reconnaissance, which is suspicious in the context of a setup script. The URL appears suspicious and could be malicious. The code does not perform any setup-related tasks besides this data transmission, indicating malicious intent or privacy violation.",
  "conclusion": "The code conducts unauthorized data collection and exfiltration by transmitting system information to an external server. The behavior is suspicious and potentially malicious, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent.",
