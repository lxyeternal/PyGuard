{
  "purpose": "The code initializes variables from environment variables or user input, performs calculations, and does not contain eval/exec, network connections, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, function parameters",
  "sinks": "Data processing functions, variable assignments",
  "flows": "Input sources to variable assignments and processing functions",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected; no obfuscation or hardcoded secrets observed",
  "analysis": "The code appears benign, with no malicious functions, network activity, or obfuscation. The use of environment variables or inputs without validation is noted but not inherently malicious. The code structure is straightforward, and no suspicious data flows or anomalies are present. Confidence is high due to the lack of suspicious features and the clarity of the code. The malware score is set to 0, obfuscation score to 0, and security risk score to 0.2 to reflect minimal potential concern from unvalidated inputs, which is reasonable given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score appropriately reflects minimal concerns. Overall, the supply chain security posture is considered safe based on the provided code snippet.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
