  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a specific function or utility, but the exact purpose cannot be determined due to the lack of code content provided.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from user input, environment variables, or external libraries (specific sources cannot be identified without code).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file operations, or data processing functions where untrusted data could be exploited, but specifics are not provided.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (user input, environment variables) through processing functions to sinks (network, file), but detailed flow cannot be assessed without concrete code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected due to absence of code content; need actual code to identify suspicious patterns such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated parts, or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "Insufficient code provided to perform detailed analysis. Unable to identify sources, sinks, or flows or to detect anomalies. The structure and behavior cannot be evaluated without actual code snippets.",
