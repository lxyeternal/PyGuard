  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script, potentially intended for data processing or utility functions. Without specific context, its main purpose cannot be definitively determined.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from standard input (e.g., sys.stdin or input()) or files opened within the code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or system commands if present, but none are explicitly evident without seeing the actual code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (user input, files) to sinks (outputs, network, files) through processing functions or operations. Specific flow details cannot be determined without the actual code content.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious function calls are detectable without the code snippet.",
  "analysis": "The analysis is limited by the absence of provided code. Based on the instruction, no malicious or suspicious patterns can be identified without examining the actual code content. No anomalies or malicious behavior are evident in the available information.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available information, there are no apparent signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, but a definitive assessment requires viewing the actual source code.",
