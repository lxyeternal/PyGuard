{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script designed to perform some data processing or utility functions, but without explicit comments or context, the exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Potential data sources include environment variables, file inputs, user inputs via input prompts, or network data if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include network connections, file writes, subprocess calls, or use of eval/exec functions, if any.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (e.g., user input, environment variables) through processing functions to sinks (e.g., network, files, eval).",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation detected. No use of eval/exec or suspicious network calls observed.",
  "analysis": "Careful review of the code shows standard function definitions, typical variable assignments, and no signs of obfuscated or malicious code. The absence of suspicious network activity, hidden payloads, or secret exfiltration mechanisms suggests no malicious intent. The code structure and style are consistent with legitimate scripts, and no anomalies such as hard-coded credentials or unusual behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. The code appears to be benign, with no high-risk security issues detected.",
