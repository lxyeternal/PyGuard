{
  "purpose": "To evaluate the security posture of the provided Python code snippets, identifying potential malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on code content, structure, and context.",
  "sources": "Input data, environment variables, network calls, file I/O, and any data read or processed within the code.",
  "sinks": "Network transmissions, file writes, environment variable access, or data exfiltration points where untrusted data could lead to security issues.",
  "flows": "Data flow from sources (inputs) to sinks (outputs or sensitive operations), including any suspicious or anomalous data handling paths.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, dynamic code execution, suspicious imports, or patterns indicative of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal or absent across all reports, with no suspicious imports, obfuscation, or malicious patterns identified. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0) are consistent with the lack of evidence. Risk scores are low (around 0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal threat given the limited or empty code. Confidence levels are appropriate, considering the limited data. No anomalies or suspicious flows are detected. Overall, the assessments are justified and align with the evidence, indicating a benign and safe codebase.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code snippets and descriptions do not exhibit malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores and confidence levels are appropriate, and no further action is necessary based on the current information.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
