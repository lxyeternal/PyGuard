{
  "purpose": "Define a client class for sending events to a specified endpoint via HTTP POST requests.",
  "sources": "User provides 'endpoint', 'event_type', 'timestamp', and 'event_data'; data is formatted and sent over HTTP.",
  "targets": "The '_send_event' method sends data via POST request; 'endpoint' and 'event_data' are untrusted inputs.",
  "flows": "Input data (endpoint, event_type, timestamp, event_data) flows into '_send_event', which formats and transmits data via HTTP POST.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code patterns; uses standard libraries and patterns without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a client class inheriting from a base class, setting up an HTTP session with optional adapter configs. It formats timestamps in ISO format, then sends event data in JSON format via POST to the specified endpoint. The code employs standard patterns, uses 'requests' safely, and does not perform any suspicious or malicious activities. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The purpose appears to be legitimate event reporting.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of an event client that sends data over HTTP. It does not contain malicious behavior or supply chain risks based on the provided snippet.",
