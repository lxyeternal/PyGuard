  "purpose": "A client class for sending event data to a specified endpoint using HTTP POST requests.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'endpoint', 'event_type', 'timeout', 'logger', 'adapter_kwargs'; data for requests in '_send_event' method.",
  "sinks": "The 'resp.raise_for_status()' method could expose response errors; 'session.post' sends data over network.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> _send_event prepares data -> session.post sends data to endpoint -> response handled by raise_for_status.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; standard usage of requests library; no obfuscated code or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a client for sending event data via HTTP POST, with proper session management and timestamp formatting. It uses a well-known requests library and standard class design. No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns detected. The data flow appears legitimate for event logging. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors identified. The code operates as intended for a remote logging client.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate client implementation for event reporting with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It uses standard practices and does not contain any hidden or malicious behaviors.",
