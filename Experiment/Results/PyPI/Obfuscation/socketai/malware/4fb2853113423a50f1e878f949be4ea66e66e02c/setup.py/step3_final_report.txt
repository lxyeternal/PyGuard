  "purpose": "Detects suspicious obfuscated PowerShell execution during package setup, potentially malicious.",
  "sources": "Checks for 'tahg' directory; executes encoded PowerShell command via subprocess if absent.",
  "sinks": "Execution of hidden, obfuscated PowerShell command; silent error handling conceals failures.",
  "flows": "Absence of 'tahg' triggers subprocess.Popen with encoded command; command runs silently in background.",
  "anomalies": "Use of Base64-encoded PowerShell command; silent exception handling; execution during package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a directory check and, if missing, executes an obfuscated PowerShell command silently. The command is encoded in Base64, which is a common obfuscation tactic. The subprocess is run with hidden window flags, and exceptions are silently caught, hiding errors. This pattern is characteristic of malicious payload delivery or backdoor installation. The high obfuscation and stealth execution strongly suggest malicious intent, although decoding the payload would confirm this. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.8, obfuscated ~0.9, risk ~0.8-0.85) are justified given these behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The script exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to obfuscated, stealthy PowerShell execution during setup. The broad exception handling further obscures potential errors. The high scores across malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified and recommend cautious treatment of this package until payload decoding confirms malicious intent.",
