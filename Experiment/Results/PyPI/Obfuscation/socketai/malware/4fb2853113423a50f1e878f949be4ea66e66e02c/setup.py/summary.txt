  "conclusion": "The script exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to obfuscated, stealthy PowerShell execution during setup. The broad exception handling further obscures potential errors. The high scores across malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified and recommend cautious treatment of this package until payload decoding confirms malicious intent."
