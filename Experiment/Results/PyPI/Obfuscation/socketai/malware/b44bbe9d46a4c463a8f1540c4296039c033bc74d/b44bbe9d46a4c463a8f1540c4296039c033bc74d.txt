      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to covert data exfiltration, obfuscation, and external network communication embedded in a setup script. The high malware and risk scores are appropriate, and the package should be treated as potentially malicious until further investigation."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is primarily a password derivation and obfuscation utility with heavy obfuscation and suspicious output handling. It does not contain explicit malicious payloads such as network communication or destructive actions. However, the obfuscation, use of clipboard, and non-standard sys attribute suggest potential for covert data handling or exfiltration if misused. The malware score is estimated at 0.2–0.3, the obfuscation score at 0.8, and the overall security risk at 0.4, indicating moderate caution is warranted."
