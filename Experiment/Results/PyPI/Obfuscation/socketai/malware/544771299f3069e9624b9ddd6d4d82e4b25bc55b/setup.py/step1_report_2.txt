{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a Python package setup configuration with a custom installation step that executes obfuscated code during installation.",
  "sources": "The obfuscated string 'QSNgDeyxtraFXfzouOKVgHWYYNpmMbFp' and the encrypted string 'rAPzQNZkzogAkMcYHFpEPfVSXrlGGgcu' are read directly from the source code.",
  "sinks": "The code executes dynamically generated code via eval(compile(...)), which could execute malicious payloads, and this execution is based on the decrypted string derived from obfuscated data.",
  "flows": "The code reads obfuscated data and encrypted data, decrypts and decodes it into executable code, then executes it via eval(compile(...)). The flow starts from the obfuscated string, proceeds through decryption and decoding, and ends with code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of heavily obfuscated string literals, dynamic execution via eval and compile, and the use of XOR decryption with a large number-based key are highly suspicious. The code does not reveal its true intent until runtime and uses obfuscation to hide malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools and defines a custom install class. During installation, it decrypts a large obfuscated string via XOR with a large numeric key, then uses eval(compile()) to execute the decrypted code. The decryption and dynamic execution strongly suggest malicious intent, as this technique is commonly used to conceal harmful code. The setup() function defines a package with minimal dependencies, but the crucial part is the runtime code execution which is obscured, indicating a high likelihood of malicious payload embedded within the encrypted string. No legitimate setup logic or benign code is observable; the obfuscation and eval execution constitute a significant security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code employs obfuscation and dynamic code execution to conceal potentially malicious behavior, likely executing hidden payloads during installation. This pattern is characteristic of supply chain attacks and malicious package distribution. It is highly recommended to treat this package as dangerous and avoid its usage.",
