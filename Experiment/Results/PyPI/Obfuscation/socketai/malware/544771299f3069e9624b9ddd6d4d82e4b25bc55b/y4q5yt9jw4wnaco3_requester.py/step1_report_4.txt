  "purpose": "The code defines an empty class named wqCCjcDTolZKGBYExJdFnUDOkEszFqRC.",
  "sources": "There are no input or data reading sources in the code.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where data is written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths are present.",
  "anomalies": "The class name appears obfuscated or nonsensical, which may suggest intentional concealment, but the class itself does nothing.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a class declaration with no methods, attributes, or executable statements. The class is empty and does not perform any actions, read input, or interact with external systems. The class name is obfuscated, which can sometimes be used to hide malicious intent, but without any code inside, it is unlikely to be malicious. There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, network activity, or other malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a minimal, empty class with an obfuscated name. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided fragment. Its primary suspicious aspect is the obfuscated class name, but without additional code, there is no evidence of malicious intent.",
