{
  "purpose": "Constructor method definition, likely intended for a class but lacks class context",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leak points present",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow beyond method definition",
  "anomalies": "The method is defined without a class context; unusual syntax but not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code defines an '__init__' method which appears to be a constructor, but it is not within a class scope. It contains no executable code, input reading, or data processing. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or malicious constructs are present. The absence of context makes it a potentially incomplete or placeholder code. No signs of obfuscation or malware behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal, syntactically correct method definition with no malicious intent or security risks. Its isolated form suggests incomplete code or a placeholder, with no apparent security concerns.",
