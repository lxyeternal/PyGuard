  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths identified.",
  "anomalies": "The __init__ method is defined without 'self' parameter, which is syntactically incorrect in Python class definitions. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to define an __init__ method, which in Python should be within a class and include 'self' as the first parameter. Its current form suggests it is either incomplete or incorrectly formatted. There is no malicious behavior, data handling, or security risk observable in this minimal snippet. The absence of 'self' indicates a likely syntactical error or incomplete code, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be an incomplete or incorrect class constructor definition with no malicious intent or security issues. It does not perform any data processing, external communication, or suspicious operations.",
