  "anomalies": "Empty constructor method, no functionality or data handling; no suspicious activity or code manipulation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an __init__ method, typically used as a constructor in classes. However, the method is not part of a class and contains only a pass statement, which is a no-op. There are no data inputs, outputs, or logic present. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are detectable.",
  "conclusion": "This is a minimal, benign placeholder method with no operational code. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
