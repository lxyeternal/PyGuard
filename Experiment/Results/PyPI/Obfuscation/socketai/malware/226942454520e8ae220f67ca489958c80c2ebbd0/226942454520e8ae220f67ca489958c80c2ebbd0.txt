      "conclusion": "Most reports correctly identify benign code, but Report 1 underestimates the risk posed by eval/exec usage. Increasing its malware score to 0.6 and security risk to 0.6 better reflects the potential for code injection. Report 4's high scores are justified given the suspicious patterns. Overall, the assessments are aligned with the code behaviors, with minor adjustments needed for Report 1."
