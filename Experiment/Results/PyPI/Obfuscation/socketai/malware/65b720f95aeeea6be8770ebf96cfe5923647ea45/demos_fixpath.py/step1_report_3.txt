  "flows": "__file__ -> normpath/join -> sys.path.insert",
  "anomalies": "Use of a complex variable name that appears obfuscated; no other suspicious code or data manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code computes the parent directory of the current script using __file__, normalizes the path, and inserts it at the beginning of sys.path to influence module importing. The variable name used for the path is obfuscated but does not inherently indicate malicious intent. The code only modifies the import path and does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or other malicious actions. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard pattern for modifying the import path, possibly for module resolution purposes. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or malware in this code fragment.",
