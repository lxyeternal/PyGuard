  "purpose": "The code computes the parent directory of the current script and prepends it to sys.path for local module imports.",
  "sources": "Reads __file__ to determine current script location, joins and normalizes the path.",
  "sinks": "Modifies sys.path to include the parent directory, affecting module import resolution.",
  "flows": "Source (__file__) -> Path computation -> sys.path.insert() (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Use of an obfuscated variable name for the path, which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard operation: adjusting sys.path to include the parent directory of the script. The variable name is obfuscated, which could be for concealment but does not imply malicious intent. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious operations are present. The pattern is common in Python projects to facilitate local module imports. The obfuscation alone is not sufficient to suggest malicious behavior, especially given the benign purpose and lack of suspicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup snippet for local module import management. Despite the obfuscated variable name, there is no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. The malware score is 0, and the overall security risk is minimal.",
