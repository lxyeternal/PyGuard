  "purpose": "A setup script for packaging a Python project, reading version info from a file.",
  "sources": "File read operations, regex search for version string within the file content.",
  "sinks": "None that lead to data leaks or malicious actions; only file reading and regex parsing.",
  "flows": "Reads file content, searches for version string, returns it; no external data or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, but no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script that reads a version string from a file using regex. Variable names are obfuscated, but the logic is benign, with no network activity, code injection, or malicious data handling. The regex targets a specific pattern to extract version info, which is typical in such scripts. No external communication or dangerous operations are present. The obfuscation appears superficial, likely for concealment rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated setup script with no malware or malicious behavior. The obfuscation is superficial and does not indicate malicious intent. Security risks are minimal, and the code is standard for packaging purposes.",
