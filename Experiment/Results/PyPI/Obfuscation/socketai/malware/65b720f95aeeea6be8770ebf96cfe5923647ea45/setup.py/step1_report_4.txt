{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, primarily aimed at reading package metadata and version information from a file.",
  "sources": "File reading functions (`VvkNyXBNWsEYzKpvxGvbSDOSvdoLAMjN`, `oitdFabgekYjngIfhaSFKXRbzayhKlAc`) that read content from files relative to the script's location.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes or transmits untrusted data; the only output is static package metadata.",
  "flows": "File content is read from the filesystem for extracting version info, with no data flowing from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The variable names are obfuscated or randomly generated, which is unusual for standard setup scripts. The version extraction regex is tightly scoped but straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and defines functions to read files and extract version info via regex. The setup() call contains package metadata and requires no user input or network activity. No malicious code or suspicious behaviors are detected. The obfuscated variable names do not indicate malicious intent but are atypical.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package, with obfuscated variable names that do not suggest malicious behavior. No malware or security risks are present. The code appears benign and purely for package configuration.",
