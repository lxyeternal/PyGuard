{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be designed for printing colored text output using external color-related modules.",
  "sources": "Imports from the 'colorama' module and attribute access on imported objects; no external input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "Print statements outputting text; no evident data leaks or external communication.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows from sources to sinks; data flows are limited to predefined attribute values for display.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated attribute names (e.g., hehYQPhAXlyilYfgfcYjZEUpmdRPVytn) and non-descriptive variable names suggest obfuscation; no actual malicious code or hardcoded secrets are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports obfuscated attributes from a module and uses them for colored text output. No user input, network operations, or data manipulation occurs. The obfuscation could be an attempt to hide malicious intent, but given the limited scope, it appears to be for aesthetic or stylistic purposes. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious actions are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The script is primarily for printing colored text with obfuscated attribute names. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected within this code segment. The obfuscation seems superficial and not indicative of malicious intent.",
