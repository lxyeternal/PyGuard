  "purpose": "Obfuscated script that initializes colorama and prints concatenated strings based on obscure attribute calls.",
  "sources": "Attribute accesses on colorama with nonsensical names, function call to colorama.hehYQPhAXlyilYfgfcYjZEUpmdRPVytn()",
  "sinks": "String concatenation and print statement; no external data, network, or file operations observed",
  "flows": "Attribute calls (sources) are concatenated with strings and numeric arguments, then printed",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated attribute and function names, non-standard attribute usage, call to a non-standard function from colorama",
  "analysis": "The code relies on obfuscated attribute names from colorama, calling a custom or non-standard function, then printing a complex concatenation of these calls with strings. No network activity, data exfiltration, or system modification is evident. The obfuscation suggests an attempt to hide intent, but the core activity appears benign—mainly printing strings. The absence of malicious functions or external data sources indicates low likelihood of malicious behavior. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not confirm malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is an obfuscated script that performs benign string concatenation and printing. While obfuscation raises suspicion, there is no direct evidence of malware or malicious activity. The high obfuscation score is justified, and the malware score should remain low. The overall security risk is moderate due to obfuscation but not malicious intent.",
