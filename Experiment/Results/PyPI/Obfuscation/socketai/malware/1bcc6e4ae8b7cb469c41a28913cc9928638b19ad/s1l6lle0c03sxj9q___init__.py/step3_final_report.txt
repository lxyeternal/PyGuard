{
  "purpose": "The code downloads an executable from a remote URL and immediately executes it without validation, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "URL string pointing to Discord CDN, `urllib.urlretrieve`, and `os.startfile` for execution.",
  "sinks": "`os.startfile` executing the downloaded file.",
  "flows": "Download from URL -> Save as 'download.exe' -> Execute via `os.startfile`.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded URL, immediate execution without validation, use of deprecated `urllib.urlretrieve`, function name appears obfuscated or random.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward malicious pattern: fetching an external executable and executing it without checks. The URL is suspicious, and the use of `urllib.urlretrieve` suggests outdated or unsecure code. The function name's obfuscation hints at intent to evade detection. No validation, checksum, or user prompt is present, increasing risk. The pattern aligns with malware delivery mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential, actively downloading and executing external code without validation, with suspicious source and obfuscated naming. It should be classified as malicious with maximum scores.",
