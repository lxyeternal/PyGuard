{
  "purpose": "Download and execute an external executable file from a remote URL.",
  "sources": "The URL 'https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/936752659241771009/936753057998442506/Setup.exe' is a remote data source; the os.startfile call executes the downloaded file.",
  "sinks": "The os.startfile function executes the downloaded file without validation, potentially running malicious code.",
  "flows": "The code retrieves the executable from the URL and immediately executes it via os.startfile.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded URL pointing to an executable, immediate execution of downloaded file without validation or user consent, use of deprecated urllib function in favor of newer modules.",
  "analysis": "The script downloads a file from a remote URL and executes it directly on the system. There are no input validations, integrity checks, or user prompts. The URL points to a Discord CDN resource, which is a suspicious source for executing files automatically. The code is minimal but malicious intent is high due to automatic execution of external content. No obfuscation is present, but the behavior is highly risky. This pattern is typical of malware that aims to install unwanted or malicious software without user knowledge.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and likely malicious, designed to download and execute a potentially harmful executable without user consent. It poses a significant security risk and should be treated as malicious behavior.",
