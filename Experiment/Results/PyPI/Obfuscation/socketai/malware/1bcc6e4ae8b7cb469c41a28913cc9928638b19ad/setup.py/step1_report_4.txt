  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, defining metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads no external input; defines static package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; no network or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; static metadata configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names that appear obfuscated; package name 's1l6lle0c03sxj9q' is intentionally obfuscated, possibly to conceal intent. No sensitive data, credentials, or network activity present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and os modules, sets up file paths and package metadata, and calls setup() with static parameters. The obfuscated package name and variable names could be suspicious, but there is no evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code injection. All code appears to be standard package setup with intentionally obfuscated identifiers, which could be an attempt to evade detection but does not necessarily indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard setup script with obfuscated identifiers. No malicious activity or security risks are detected based on the provided code. The obfuscation is suspicious but does not constitute malicious behavior.",
