{
  "purpose": "This code defines setup configuration for a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__)), hardcoded strings for version, description, and package name",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or used in a harmful way",
  "flows": "The code reads file paths and sets package metadata but does not process external data at runtime",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names (e.g., HsXpleOFKEJngqpYDkjxWYivxodapQCW), suspicious variable naming, and package name 's1l6lle0c03sxj9q' which appears obfuscated or non-descriptive; no actual malicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setuptools functions, determines the current directory, and sets package metadata. The variable names are obfuscated but only contain string assignments; there are no dynamic imports, code execution, or network activity. The package name appears intentionally obscure but is not inherently malicious. The setup call is standard and safe. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or supply chain attack are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a normal setup script with obfuscated variable names, likely to evade casual inspection. There is no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. The package name and variable names are unusual but not harmful.",
