  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading filename (__file__), static string variables for version and description, setup() arguments.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or output functions.",
  "flows": "Static data (strings) passed directly into setup() without external influence.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names that do not serve a clear purpose, minimal metadata. No malicious code or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setuptools functions, defines some variables with obfuscated names, and calls setup() with package info. The variables holding version and description are hardcoded. No user input, network activity, or malicious behavior evident. The obfuscated variable names appear to be an attempt to hide intent but do not execute any malicious code or logic. The code is a typical package setup script with no anomalies indicating malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with obfuscated variable names, but no malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks identified.",
