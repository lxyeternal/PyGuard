{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package, defining package metadata using setuptools with obfuscated variable names and package name.",
  "sources": "Static string assignments to variables, package name, and setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, no data leaks, no network calls, no code execution beyond static setup.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration; no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names and package name, but no dynamic or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated identifiers, which could be an attempt to hide intent. No malicious behavior, network activity, or data exfiltration detected. Obfuscation is superficial, with variables assigned static strings and unused beyond setup call. The package name and variable names are unusual but not inherently malicious. Scores reflect high obfuscation (0.7-0.8), no malware (0.0), and low security risk (~0.2). The code's behavior is benign, but obfuscation warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated setup script with no evidence of malicious activity. Obfuscation is superficial and does not constitute a security threat, though it warrants cautious monitoring. Scores are consistent with the analysis, indicating a low security risk.",
