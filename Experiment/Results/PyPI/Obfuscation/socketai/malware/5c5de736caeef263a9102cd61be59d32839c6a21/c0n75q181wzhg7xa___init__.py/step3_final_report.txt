  "purpose": "Simple print statement outputting 'Hola' with no external dependencies or malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed or outputted to external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only executes a print statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward print statement with a static string, no input handling, dependencies, or complex logic. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent or security concerns. All reports are accurate, and no modifications are necessary.",
