  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n1. **Report 1**:\n   - **Issue presence**: The report correctly states that the code is just a print statement with no input, external dependencies, or suspicious constructs.\n   - **Errors/flaws**: None identified.\n   - **Scores**:\n     - Malware: 0 — accurate.\n     - Obfuscated: 0 — accurate.\n     - SecurityRisk: 0 — appropriate.\n   - **Conclusion**: The assessment is reasonable and consistent.\n\n2. **Report 2**:\n   - **Issue presence**: Correctly notes that the code outputs a static string with no data flow from untrusted sources.\n   - **Errors/flaws**: None.\n   - **Scores**:\n     - Malware: 0 — appropriate.\n     - Obfuscated: 0 — accurate.\n     - SecurityRisk: 0 — appropriate.\n   - **Conclusion**: Well justified.\n\n3. **Report 3**:\n   - **Issue presence**: The code is a simple print statement with no input or external dependencies.\n   - **Errors/flaws**: No issues.\n   - **Scores**:\n     - Malware: 0 — correct.\n     - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.\n     - SecurityRisk: 0 — correct.\n   - **Conclusion**: Consistent.\n\n4. **Report 4**:\n   - **Issue presence**: No input, external dependencies, or suspicious behavior.\n   - **Errors/flaws**: None.\n   - **Scores**:\n     - Malware: 0 — appropriate.\n     - Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.\n     - SecurityRisk: 0 — appropriate.\n   - **Conclusion**: Correct.\n\n5. **Report 5**:\n   - **Issue presence**: The report notes that the string is hardcoded, which is typical in simple scripts.\n   - **Errors/flaws**: No issues.\n   - **Scores**:\n     - Malware: 0 — accurate.\n     - Obfuscated: 0 — accurate.\n     - SecurityRisk: 0 — accurate.\n   - **Conclusion**: Justified.\n\n**Overall assessment**:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the content and nature of the code.\n\n**Additional notes**:\n- Since the code is extremely simple and straightforward, there's no reason to adjust the scores.\n- The malware score remains at 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, as there's no indication of code obfuscation.\n- The security risk score is 0, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n**Final estimated scores**:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\n**Summary**:\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a trivial print statement with no security concerns. No modifications are necessary.",
