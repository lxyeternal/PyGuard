  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check their claims, and evaluate the scores assigned.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe a very simple code: `print(\"Hola\")`.\n- They consistently state that there are no inputs, external dependencies, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The code performs a benign output operation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming if issues are present:\n- The original code is just a print statement with a static string.\n- No input, data flow, or external dependencies.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues are present in the code itself.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### Reports 1-4:\n- All describe the code as a straightforward print statement with no security risks.\n- They assign:\n  - confidence: 1\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - malware: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n\n**Assessment:** These are accurate. The code is benign, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n#### Report 5:\n- Adds that the source is a hardcoded string `'Hola'`.\n- Describes data flow from the string to output.\n- Still states no anomalies or malicious behavior.\n- Scores:\n  - confidence: 1\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - malware: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n\n**Assessment:** The mention of a hardcoded string does not imply a security concern here; it's a common pattern. The reasoning remains sound.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation of scores:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. There's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, which is accurate.\n- **Security risk:** All assign 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n\n**Potential adjustments:**\n- Given the simplicity and benign nature, the scores are appropriate.\n- No report overstates or underestimates risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Overall malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese match the code's characteristics.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The code is a trivial print statement with no issues.\n- All reports correctly identify the benign nature.\n- Scores are reasonable and consistent.\n\n**Final estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis.",
