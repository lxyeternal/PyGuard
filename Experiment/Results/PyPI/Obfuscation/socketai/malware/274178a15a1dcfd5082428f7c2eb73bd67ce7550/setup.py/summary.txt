  "conclusion": "The code contains highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell execution embedded within a setup script, indicative of malicious intent. The stealthy execution and encoding techniques align with common malware tactics. While the exact payload remains unknown without decoding, the evidence justifies high malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores. It is strongly recommended to decode the payload and analyze its behavior before deployment or distribution."
