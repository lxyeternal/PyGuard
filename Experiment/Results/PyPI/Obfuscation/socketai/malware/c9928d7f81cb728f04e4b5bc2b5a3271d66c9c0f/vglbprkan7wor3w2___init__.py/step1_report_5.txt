{
  "purpose": "The code extracts saved Chrome passwords and login data, decrypts them, and then exfiltrates the gathered credentials to a remote Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "Reads from Chrome's 'Login Data' SQLite database, 'Local State' JSON file, and the 'passwords.txt' file created during execution.",
  "sinks": "Sends 'passwords.txt' content via HTTP POST to a Discord webhook URL, exposing sensitive credentials.",
  "flows": "Extracts passwords from Chrome database → decrypts passwords → writes credentials to 'passwords.txt' → uploads the file to remote server via webhook.",
  "anomalies": "Uses hardcoded webhook URL, attempts to decrypt passwords using multiple methods, writes passwords to local file, and exfiltrates data without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The script accesses Chrome's stored login credentials by reading the 'Login Data' SQLite database and 'Local State' file. It decrypts passwords using Windows' CryptUnprotectData API and AES-GCM with an encrypted key retrieved from 'Local State'. Extracted credentials are saved into 'passwords.txt'. Subsequently, the script uploads this file to a remote Discord webhook, indicating data exfiltration. The presence of hardcoded webhook URL and the automation of credential extraction without user interaction are suspicious behaviors. The code leverages standard decryption APIs and does not obfuscate code or use uncommon language features, but it clearly aims to harvest and transmit sensitive user data maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a credential stealer targeting Chrome stored passwords, exfiltrating sensitive data to a remote server. It exhibits typical malicious behavior with direct data extraction, decryption, and data exfiltration, indicating high malicious intent.",
