{
  "purpose": "The code extracts stored passwords from Chrome browser, decrypts them, and uploads them to a remote Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "Reads Chrome's 'Login Data' SQLite database, reads 'Local State' JSON file, and reads 'passwords.txt' file.",
  "sinks": "Sends the collected passwords file to a remote webhook URL via HTTP POST request.",
  "flows": "Reads login data and encryption keys -> decrypts passwords -> writes data to 'passwords.txt' -> reads 'passwords.txt' -> uploads to remote server.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, dynamic file path construction, usage of internal Windows cryptography functions, and automatic password exfiltration without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The script retrieves the Chrome login data and decryption keys from local files, decrypts stored passwords using Windows cryptography and AES GCM, then writes this sensitive data to a text file. It subsequently uploads this file to a remote Discord webhook URL, indicating data exfiltration. The code contains obfuscated variable names and unconventional file path constructions, which are common in malicious scripts. The final step involves sending the passwords to an external server, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The code does not appear to perform any legitimate function; instead, it is designed to steal user credentials covertly.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, performing credential theft by extracting and exfiltrating Chrome saved passwords without user authorization. It exhibits obfuscation techniques and directly transmits sensitive data to an external server, which constitutes malicious behavior.",
