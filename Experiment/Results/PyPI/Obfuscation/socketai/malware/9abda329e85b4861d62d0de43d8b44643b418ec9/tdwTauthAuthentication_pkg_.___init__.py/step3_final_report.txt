  "sources": "Filesystem metadata, specifically the extended attribute 'com.apple.quarantine' on macOS files.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the data is static metadata, not dynamic or executable content.",
  "flows": "N/A - static metadata; no data flow from source to sink involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the data is a standard macOS quarantine attribute with no embedded code or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The provided data is a binary blob representing a filesystem extended attribute used by macOS to mark files as quarantined. It contains no executable code, scripts, or payloads. All reviews correctly identify it as benign metadata, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the data. Confidence levels are high, given the static and system-generated nature of the attribute. No evidence suggests malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The data is a benign macOS filesystem metadata attribute indicating quarantine status. It contains no malicious code or suspicious activity. The existing assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the data.",
