{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, but it also collects system information and sends it to a remote server, which may be malicious.",
  "sources": "Data is collected from system calls (os.getlogin(), platform.node(), platform.uname(), os.getcwd()) and network socket connection to determine the IP address, then combined and encoded.",
  "sinks": "The base64-encoded system data is sent via an HTTP GET request to a remote server at 'http://129.226.195.123/v/...'.",
  "flows": "System information (login, hostname, uname, current directory, IP) -> encoding in base64 -> HTTP GET request to remote server with data as URL parameter.",
  "anomalies": "The code secretly gathers sensitive system information and transmits it to an external IP without any user consent or indication. The IP address '129.226.195.123' is potentially suspicious. The use of string formatting and data encoding to hide data exfiltration is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script begins as a typical setup file but then proceeds to collect sensitive system information: current login name, hostname, system details, current working directory, and IP address via socket connection. It constructs a multiline string with this data, encodes it in base64, and sends it to an external server via an HTTP GET request. This behavior is not typical for a legitimate setup script and indicates potential data exfiltration. The remote server address is hardcoded, and the data sent includes potentially sensitive user info. The setup function itself appears standard, but the prior data collection and transmission are malicious behaviors.\n\nThe code does not appear to use obfuscation techniques; the data collection and transmission are straightforward but hidden within a seemingly legitimate setup process.",
  "conclusion": "This code is likely malicious due to its covert collection and exfiltration of system information to an external IP address. It masquerades as a setup script but contains behaviors typical of data theft or remote monitoring. The core risk stems from the unauthorized transmission of sensitive data, making it highly suspicious and potentially malicious.",
