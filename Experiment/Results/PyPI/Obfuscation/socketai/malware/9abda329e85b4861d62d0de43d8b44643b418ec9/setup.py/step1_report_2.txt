{
  "purpose": "The code appears to collect system information and send it to a remote server during package setup, potentially for tracking or malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "System information retrieval methods such as os.getlogin(), platform.node(), platform.uname(), os.getcwd(), and socket connection to determine IP address.",
  "sinks": "Requests to an external server with encoded system information, specifically the HTTP GET request to 'http://129.226.195.123/v/%s'.",
  "flows": "System information is gathered, encoded in base64, and sent via a GET request to a remote server, which could potentially log or misuse this data.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated data encoding and immediate transmission of system details to an external IP address during setup; use of hardcoded IP and suspicious URL suggest malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script imports various modules to gather system details including login name, hostname, OS info, current directory, and IP address. It encodes this information in base64 and sends it to a remote server. The setup call indicates this code runs during package installation, possibly without user consent. The use of an external IP (129.226.195.123) and URL 'http://129.226.195.123/v/%s' raises suspicion of data exfiltration. The code does not perform any clear malicious actions like executing commands or modifying files but appears designed to covertly collect and transmit system info.",
  "conclusion": "The code is potentially malicious, primarily due to covert data collection and transmission during package setup. It may serve as a backdoor or a tracking mechanism, indicating malicious behavior.",
