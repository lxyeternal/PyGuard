{
  "purpose": "The code appears to prepare some system information and send it to a remote server, then proceed with a package setup configuration.",
  "sources": "Reading system information via os, platform, socket, and user login; constructing a data string; base64 encoding; sending an HTTP GET request to a remote IP address.",
  "sinks": "Requests to the IP address 'http://129.226.195.123/v/...'; base64 encoding of system info; socket connections to determine IP address.",
  "flows": "Collects system info -> encodes it in base64 -> sends via HTTP GET request to remote server.",
  "anomalies": "The code gathers detailed system information (including login name, hostname, uname, current working directory, IP address) and transmits it unencrypted to a suspicious external IP address. The IP address and URL are hardcoded. The purpose of this data collection and transmission is suspicious and suggests potential privacy violation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script collects sensitive system details such as login name, hostname, system uname, current directory, and local IP address. It then encodes this information in base64 format and sends it via an HTTP GET request to an external server at 129.226.195.123. The use of system info collection combined with transmitting to an external IP without user consent indicates potential malicious behavior or privacy violation. The setup() call appears standard but is likely used to hide or facilitate further malicious activities under the guise of package setup. The code does not perform any obvious malicious actions beyond data exfiltration. No obfuscation or malware signatures are detected aside from the suspicious data exfiltration behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily performs information gathering and exfiltration of system details to a remote IP address, which is suspicious. It could be part of a malicious supply chain attack or privacy-invasive malware. The setup() function itself is standard, but the data collection and transmission are concerning and suggest malicious intent.",
