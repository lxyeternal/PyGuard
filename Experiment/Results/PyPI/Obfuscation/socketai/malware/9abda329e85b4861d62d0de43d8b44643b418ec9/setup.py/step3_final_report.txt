{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information (login, hostname, uname, current directory, IP address), encodes it in base64, and exfiltrates it via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded suspicious IP during package setup, indicating malicious data theft.",
  "sources": "os.getlogin(), platform.node(), platform.uname(), os.getcwd(), socket connection to 8.8.8.8 to obtain IP",
  "sinks": "requests.get() to external IP with base64-encoded data",
  "flows": "Sources (system info) -> encoding -> HTTP GET request to remote server",
  "anomalies": "Data exfiltration during package setup without user consent, hardcoded IP address, no obfuscation beyond base64, collection of sensitive info in a covert manner",
  "analysis": "The code gathers sensitive system info and transmits it to an external server during package installation, which is unusual and privacy-invasive. No obfuscation or malicious payloads like file modification or command execution are present. The hardcoded IP and data transmission are suspicious. The behavior indicates covert data theft, consistent with malicious activity. The code's straightforward nature and timing during setup make it highly suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs covert system info exfiltration during package setup, indicating malicious intent. It is not obfuscated, but the behavior is privacy-invasive and potentially harmful. The malware score is high, and security risk is significant.",
