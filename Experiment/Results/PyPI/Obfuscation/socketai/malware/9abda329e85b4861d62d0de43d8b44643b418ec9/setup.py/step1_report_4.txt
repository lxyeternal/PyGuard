{
  "purpose": "The script appears to gather system information and send it to a remote server, possibly for tracking or malicious data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Reads system details via os.getlogin(), platform.node(), platform.uname(), os.getcwd(), and socket connections to determine IP address.",
  "sinks": "HTTP GET request to a remote IP ('http://129.226.195.123/v/...') which transmits encoded system data.",
  "flows": "System info is collected and encoded in base64, then sent via a GET request to the specified remote server.",
  "anomalies": "The code constructs a detailed string with system info, encodes it, and sends it to an external server without user consent. The IP address used ('8.8.8.8') is for DNS resolution but combined with data exfiltration indicates suspicious behavior. Usage of hardcoded URL and base64 encoding for transmission is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code collects system information such as hostname, current working directory, and IP address by establishing a socket connection to Google DNS. It then encodes this data in base64 and makes an HTTP GET request to a specific remote server, transmitting potentially sensitive data. The setup() call appears to be standard, but its inclusion after data transmission suggests a malicious intent to exfiltrate system info without user awareness. The hardcoded IP and URL, along with data encoding, point towards covert data collection and transmission.",
  "conclusion": "This code likely performs malicious data exfiltration by gathering system info and sending it to an external server. The behavior indicates a security risk with potential privacy invasion, classifying it as suspicious with a high malware score.",
