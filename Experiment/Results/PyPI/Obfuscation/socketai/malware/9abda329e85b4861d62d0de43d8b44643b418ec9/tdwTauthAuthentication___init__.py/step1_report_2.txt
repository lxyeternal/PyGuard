{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from a local module named 'api' and sets a version string.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from .api import *' reads from a local module within the package.",
  "sinks": "The code does not explicitly send data to external sources or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "No specific data flow is observable; the only action is importing and setting a version string.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' can be considered a risky practice, but it is not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports all symbols from a local module, which can potentially lead to namespace pollution but does not indicate malicious intent. The version string is a standard practice. There are no external network communications, no obfuscated or unusual code structures, and no signs of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard package initialization snippet with minimal risk. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided fragment.",
