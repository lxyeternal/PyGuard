  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code snippet is minimal: `from .api import *` and `__version__ = '1.0.9'`.\n- No external network activity, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors are described.\n- The use of `import *` is noted as poor practice but not inherently malicious.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malware indicators are present.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No issues.\n- **Anomalies:** Wildcard import is noted but not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.9 seems high given the benign code.\n\n**Recommendation:** The risk score of 0.9 overstates the risk; the code is minimal and safe. I suggest lowering it to **0.1** or **0.2** to reflect low risk.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No issues.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of `import *` is flagged but not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 seems reasonable.\n\n**Recommendation:** The security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate, given the poor practice but no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No issues.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; benign code.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 is justified.\n\n**Recommendation:** Scores are consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No issues.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious behavior.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 is justified.\n\n**Recommendation:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No issues.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of `import *` noted.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 is reasonable.\n\n**Recommendation:** The risk score of 0.1 is appropriate; no adjustment needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- The only scores that seem inflated are the `securityRisk` and `risk` scores in reports 1 and 2, which are set at 0.9 and 0.2 respectively, despite the code being trivial and benign.\n- Malware scores are all zero, correctly reflecting no malicious behavior.\n- Obfuscation scores are zero, consistent with the code clarity.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** All zero, consistent.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All zero, consistent.\n- **Risk score:** For reports 1 and 2, reduce from 0.9 and 0.2 to around 0.1 or 0.2.\n- **Security risk:** Keep low, as the code is minimal and benign.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, due to poor practice but no actual risk)\n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the code's simplicity and the lack of any suspicious behavior.",
