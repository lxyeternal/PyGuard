  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet:\n\n```python\nfrom .api import *\n\n__version__ = '1.0.9'\n```\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code is minimal: a wildcard import from a local module and a version string.\n- No network activity, data handling, or user input.\n- The use of `import *` can be considered poor practice, but it is not inherently malicious.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.\n- The `api` module's content is unknown; potential risk depends on its contents.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Analysis:** Correct; no malicious behavior, just poor practice.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malware or security risk.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0. No change needed.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid assessment.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Analysis:** Correct; no external data leaks or suspicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Minimal risk.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2 (slightly above zero due to poor practice).\n\n**Note:** The securityRisk score of 0.2 is reasonable given the use of `import *`, which can obscure imported symbols and potentially hide malicious code if the `api` module is malicious. However, since the code itself is benign, this risk is low.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Analysis:** Correct; no external communication or malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Analysis:** Correct; no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Analysis:** Correct; the main concern is the use of `import *` which can hide malicious code if the `api` module is malicious.\n- **Conclusion:** While the snippet itself is benign, the reliance on an external module that is imported with a wildcard introduces potential risk, especially if the module's contents are malicious or compromised.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- malware=0 (no direct evidence of malicious code in this snippet).  \n- securityRisk=0.1 or 0.2 could be justified, but the report assigns 0.1, which is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of findings:**\n\n- **Code presence:** The code is as expected; no malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Use of `import *`:** Not malicious but considered poor practice, potentially hiding malicious code if the imported module is compromised.\n- **Risk scores:** Overall, the scores are reasonable. The malware scores are all zero, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** I agree with all zero scores based on the provided snippet.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Zero, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** Given the minimal code and lack of malicious activity, I would keep the overall security risk low, around 0.1–0.2, primarily due to the use of `import *` which could hide malicious code if the `api` module is malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\n\n- The code snippet is benign.\n- The main concern is the use of `import *`, which warrants further review of the `api` module.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk are evident from this snippet alone.\n\n**My estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to import practices, not malicious intent)\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a deeper review of the `api` module or related components.",
