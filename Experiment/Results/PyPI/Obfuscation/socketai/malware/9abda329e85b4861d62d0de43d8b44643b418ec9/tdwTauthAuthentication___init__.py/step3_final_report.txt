  "purpose": "Minimal code importing from a local module and defining a version string, likely for package initialization.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .api module",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows present; no external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "None; code does not process untrusted input or data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' which can obscure imported symbols but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The wildcard import is poor practice but not malicious. The version string is benign. No external communication or data leaks are evident. The scores should reflect the benign nature, with malware and obfuscation scores at zero, and a low security risk score due to import practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe and benign. The use of 'import *' is discouraged but not malicious. Scores should be malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, aligning with the minimal and safe code.",
