  "purpose": "This code imports all contents from the local module 'api' and sets a version string for the package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .api",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output occurs",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flows are evident in this minimal snippet",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious behaviors detected",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple import and defines a version string. The import is relative, indicating integration within a package. There are no functions, user inputs, network calls, or data handling that could be exploited or indicate malicious intent. The version string is static and not suspicious. No anomalies or signs of obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no malicious behavior or security risks. It simply imports a module and sets a version number.",
