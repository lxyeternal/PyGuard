{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from a local module named 'api' and sets a version string for the package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from '.api' module, and the assignment of '__version__' variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data, no data leaks or security-sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "Imported functions or variables from '.api' could be used elsewhere; setting __version__ does not affect flow.",
  "anomalies": "The import statement uses a wildcard import, which can obscure the source of functions or variables, but this alone is not malicious. No other anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or suspicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing everything from a local module and defining a version string. No malicious code, data leakage, or suspicious behavior is evident. The wildcard import could be considered a poor practice but does not indicate malicious intent. The version string is standard and harmless.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet. It appears to be a typical module initialization code with no signs of malware or security issues.",
