  "purpose": "Import all contents from the 'api' module and define the package version.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .api",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flow or untrusted input handling observed",
  "flows": "None identified; the code only imports a module and sets a version string",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' can obscure what is imported, but not malicious in itself; no other anomalies detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports all symbols from a relative module named 'api', which could potentially hide malicious or unwanted behavior if 'api' contains harmful code. However, based solely on this snippet, there's no explicit malicious activity or suspicious pattern. The version string is a standard practice for package versioning. There are no network calls, credential usage, or obfuscated constructs present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a minimal module that imports an API and sets a version string. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues in this snippet, although the use of 'import *' can sometimes obscure imported contents. Further review of the 'api' module itself is recommended for comprehensive security assessment.",
