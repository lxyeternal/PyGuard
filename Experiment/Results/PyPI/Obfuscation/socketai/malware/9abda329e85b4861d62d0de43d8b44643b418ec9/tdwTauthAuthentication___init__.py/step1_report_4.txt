  "purpose": "Import all contents from the local 'api' module and define the package version.",
  "sources": "The code imports from the local module '.api'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no data is sent externally or written to insecure locations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the imported module into the current namespace, but no external or untrusted data sources are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with no apparent anomalies or suspicious constructs. The import is from a local module, and version declaration is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports all symbols from a local module named 'api', which is common in Python packages. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or use of environment variables. The version string is straightforward. The code does not include any network activity, credential handling, or obfuscated segments. Its simplicity indicates it is likely part of a larger project, and nothing suspicious is evident here.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module import with a version declaration and shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
