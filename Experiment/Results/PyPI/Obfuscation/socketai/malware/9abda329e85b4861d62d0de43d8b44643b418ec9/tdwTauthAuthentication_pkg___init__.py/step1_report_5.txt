{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple Python script that performs basic file handling and possibly data processing, with no clear indication of malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Reads data from local files and environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Writes data to local files and possibly transmits data over network sockets.",
  "flows": "Data flows from source file reads or environment variables through processing functions, then to output files or network transmissions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets detected; no obfuscated code; no suspicious network activity or unusual data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs straightforward file operations and uses standard library functions. No dynamic code execution, no suspicious network domains, and no hidden backdoors are evident. No use of eval, exec, or similar functions. No encryption or obfuscation techniques are present. It appears to be a benign utility script with typical data processing functions.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the static review, the code does not show signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It seems to be a legitimate, standard data handling script without harmful intent.",
