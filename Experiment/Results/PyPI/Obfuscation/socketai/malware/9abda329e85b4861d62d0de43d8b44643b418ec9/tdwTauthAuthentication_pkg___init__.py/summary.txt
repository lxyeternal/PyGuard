  "conclusion": "The code's malicious potential is primarily indicated by dynamic code execution functions on untrusted input, justifying high malware and security risk scores. Absence of such patterns suggests benign behavior. Obfuscation tactics, if confirmed, further elevate suspicion. Overall, the assessment aligns with the described behaviors, with high scores justified only if risky patterns are present."
