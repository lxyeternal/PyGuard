  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code patterns, obfuscation, and suspicious activities.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user inputs, network or file I/O, dynamic imports/execution, external API calls, environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, file system, environment variables, external APIs, system commands.",
  "flows": "Input sources (environment variables, user input) to sinks (network, files, environment), potentially via dynamic execution or obfuscation.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, dynamic imports/execution, minimal comments, missing or incomplete code, suspicious data flows, hardcoded credentials, unusual API usage.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and minimal documentation, with dynamic import/execution suspected but no explicit malicious functions identified. Missing or minimal code snippets limit definitive conclusions. External data sources are used but no evidence of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or cryptomining is present. The suspicion level is low, with no concrete indicators of sabotage. The scores reflect cautious suspicion due to obfuscation in some reports but align with benign behavior. Overall, the code appears low risk, with potential for hidden obfuscation but no active malicious actions detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows minor obfuscation and suspicious patterns but lacks concrete malicious indicators. The malware score is low (0.1), obfuscation score is moderate (0.2), and overall security risk is low (0.2). The assessments are consistent with the evidence, and no immediate threats are identified.",
