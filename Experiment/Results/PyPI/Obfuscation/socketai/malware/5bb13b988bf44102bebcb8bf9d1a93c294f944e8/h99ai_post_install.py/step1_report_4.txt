  "purpose": "Download and execute a remote script, install a package, and run the script with specific arguments.",
  "sources": "urllib.request.urlretrieve for the URL 'https://fhost.devxops.eu.org/devops/cicd/scripts/dh-storage-v1.1.sh'; os.system and subprocess.run executing the downloaded script.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the downloaded script via os.system and subprocess.run, which could potentially execute malicious commands or payloads.",
  "flows": "Download the script from the URL -> Save locally -> Set executable permissions -> Execute the script with specific parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function name, use of a suspicious URL (fhost.devxops.eu.org) for downloading a script, execution of external script with parameters that are not standard for benign operations.",
  "analysis": "The code downloads a shell script from a remote URL, saves it locally, sets executable permissions, updates the package list, installs 'tmux', and executes the downloaded script with '--restore', '--tag', and '--localpath' arguments. The remote URL appears suspicious and could host malicious content. The script execution without validation or checks indicates potential malicious intent, especially given the obfuscated function name and the unusual URL. The installation of 'tmux' might be benign, but combined with remote script execution, it raises security concerns. The code's behavior suggests possible remote command and script execution aimed at compromising the host system.",
  "conclusion": "The code downloads and executes a remote script from a suspicious URL, which poses a significant security risk. The purpose appears malicious, potentially allowing remote control or malicious payload deployment. The overall security risk is high due to remote script execution and the suspicious URL. The code should be considered unsafe and likely malicious.",
