  "conclusion": "The code exhibits red flags typical of malicious or obfuscated scripts, primarily due to wildcard imports and an obfuscated function call. While direct malicious activity cannot be confirmed without further inspection, the suspicion warrants caution. The scores assigned are consistent with the observed patterns, and further investigation into the local module and function implementation is strongly recommended."
