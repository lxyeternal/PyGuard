      "conclusion": "The package setup code is largely safe and standard, with an unused, obfuscated variable that does not exhibit malicious behavior. The low malware and risk scores are appropriate. Further review of the broader context is recommended, but based solely on this snippet, the code does not pose a security threat."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits red flags typical of malicious or obfuscated scripts, primarily due to wildcard imports and an obfuscated function call. While direct malicious activity cannot be confirmed without further inspection, the suspicion warrants caution. The scores assigned are consistent with the observed patterns, and further investigation into the local module and function implementation is strongly recommended."

      "conclusion": "The code is malicious, designed for targeted exfiltration of wallet and system data via Telegram. It employs obfuscation and hardcoded credentials, with the intent to steal sensitive information stealthily. Despite some implementation flaws, the overall behavior and signals justify classifying it as high-severity malware."
