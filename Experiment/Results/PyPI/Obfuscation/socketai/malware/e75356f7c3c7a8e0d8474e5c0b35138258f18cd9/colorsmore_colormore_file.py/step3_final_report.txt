{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to exfiltrate sensitive wallet files and system information by compressing them into a ZIP archive and sending it via Telegram, indicating malicious intent for data theft.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user directories (appdata, desktop, downloads, documents), wallet configuration files, and external IP geolocation API.",
  "sinks": "ZIP archive creation, Telegram API requests (sending message and document), and local file deletion.",
  "flows": "Reads sensitive files and system info, compresses into ZIP, encodes IP info, and posts data to Telegram, then deletes local copies.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names, hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID, concatenation of sensitive files, attempt to fetch external IP info, and references to undefined variables (e.g., 'username', 'TOKEN', 'os.LsUTbNscMHSCRtjSgnShyUyjjbmPlkBt').",
  "analysis": "The script's core behavior is to collect and exfiltrate wallet and system data stealthily. It employs obfuscation and hardcoded credentials, typical of malware. Despite some implementation errors (e.g., invalid method calls, undefined variables), the intent and actions are malicious. The code creates a ZIP archive with sensitive files, gathers system info, and sends it via Telegram, then deletes local copies. The presence of obfuscation and credential hardcoding strongly indicates malicious activity. The errors would hinder execution but do not negate the malicious design.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, designed for targeted exfiltration of wallet and system data via Telegram. It employs obfuscation and hardcoded credentials, with the intent to steal sensitive information stealthily. Despite some implementation flaws, the overall behavior and signals justify classifying it as high-severity malware.",
