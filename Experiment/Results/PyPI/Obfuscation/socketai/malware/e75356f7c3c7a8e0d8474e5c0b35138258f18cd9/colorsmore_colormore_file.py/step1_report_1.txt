{
  "purpose": "The script appears to collect various user data and exodus wallet files, then compresses and potentially exfiltrates them via Telegram.",
  "sources": "User environment variables (getenv), files in the user's appdata and directories, network requests to IP geolocation API, files read from disk for compression.",
  "sinks": "Writing files to zip archive, sending data via HTTP POST requests to Telegram API, removing local files after transmission.",
  "flows": "Data is read from environment variables and local files, then compressed into a zip file, and finally transmitted over the network to Telegram, including IP info and wallet files.",
  "anomalies": "Uses obfuscated variable names, hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID, concatenates sensitive wallet files and configuration files, sends system info (IP, country code), and deletes local copies after exfiltration. The code also includes non-standard, suspiciously obfuscated logic involving character manipulation and URL requests for IP data.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by gathering user and environment data, including the current username and environment variables for application data paths. It constructs file paths to wallet and config files typically associated with Exodus wallets, which are sensitive financial data. The script checks for the existence of these files and, if found, compresses them into a zip archive. It also retrieves system IP and country info from a public API, encodes this info, and appends it to a message. The message, containing system info and possibly wallet data, is then sent via Telegram using a hardcoded bot token and chat ID. Additionally, the script deletes local copies of the exfiltrated files. The code employs obfuscation techniques and hardcoded credentials, which strongly suggest malicious intent, primarily data theft and privacy invasion. The network interactions with IP geolocation API and Telegram API are consistent with exfiltration behavior. Overall, the code is malicious, attempting to harvest wallet files and system info stealthily and transmit them externally.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, designed to steal sensitive wallet files and system information, then exfiltrate them via Telegram. It employs obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, and file deletion to conceal its actions. It poses a high security threat and should be considered malware.",
