{
  "purpose": "The script appears to collect user system information, potentially sensitive files, and send them to a remote server or Telegram bot, likely for malicious data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "User input via getpass.getuser(), environment variables (LOCALAPPDATA, APPDATA, TEMP), existence checks on specific directories and files, and network requests to external services.",
  "sinks": "Writing files to ZIP archives, reading sensitive files (exodus configuration and wallet files), posting data to Telegram API endpoints, and sending ZIP files via HTTP POST requests.",
  "flows": "Data from user info, environment variables, and local files flows into ZIP archive creation. If directories/files exist, they are added to ZIP, then the ZIP is sent over network. Additionally, system info like IP and country code is fetched and appended before transmission.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names, inclusion of Telegram token and chat IDs (suggesting command-and-control communication), collection of sensitive wallet and configuration files, concatenation of system info and data for exfiltration, and sending files via Telegram API.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers system and wallet data from specific directories, suggesting it targets cryptocurrency wallets. It checks for directory existence before creating a ZIP archive of sensitive files. If the ZIP is created, it additionally fetches system IP and country code, appending this info to a message that is sent via Telegram. The script also attempts to delete the ZIP after transmission. The use of environment variables and file paths indicates stealthy data collection. The hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID are typical of command-and-control behavior. The code does not perform any benign functions; all actions relate to data exfiltration and possible malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious, designed to harvest sensitive wallet files and system info, then exfiltrate them via Telegram. Its obfuscated variable names and the nature of data collected strongly suggest malicious behavior with the intent to steal user data and monitor user activity.",
