{
  "purpose": "The script appears to gather sensitive information related to the Exodus cryptocurrency wallet, compresses wallet files, and uploads them to a remote server, possibly for theft or unauthorized access.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables (LOCALAPPDATA, APPDATA, TEMP), system username, and data from the local filesystem (wallet configuration and wallet data files). It also reads the user's system IP and country via external API requests.",
  "sinks": "Data is written into a ZIP archive and then sent via Telegram API endpoints, including both a message and a document upload. The ZIP file contains sensitive wallet files and configuration data.",
  "flows": "The code reads user and environment data, collects wallet files, compresses them into a ZIP, augments a message with IP and country info, and sends this ZIP file and message through Telegram's bot API, potentially exposing sensitive information.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names, hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID (implied), and the collection of wallet data suggest malicious intent. The code exfiltrates sensitive wallet files and system info. The script also dynamically encodes country code and IP info into a message, possibly for tracking or confirmation of exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code starts by collecting user system info and wallet-related files from specific directories, especially related to Exodus wallet. It checks for the existence of these files and creates a ZIP archive containing them. It appends system IP and country information into a message, likely for exfiltration confirmation. It then uploads this ZIP file and a message containing system info to a Telegram bot, using hardcoded token and chat ID, which indicates potential malicious intent. The presence of multiple wallet-related files and the exfiltration via Telegram suggests this script is designed to steal and transmit sensitive wallet data without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, intended to exfiltrate cryptocurrency wallet data and system info to an external server via Telegram, indicating theft or compromise activity. It demonstrates typical characteristics of malware, including obfuscated variable names, file collection of sensitive data, and data exfiltration to an external API.",
