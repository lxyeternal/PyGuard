{
  "purpose": "The code appears to gather user information, extract sensitive files related to 'exodus' (a cryptocurrency wallet), compress these files into a ZIP archive, and potentially exfiltrate them via Telegram.",
  "sources": "User environment variables (getpass.getuser(), environment variables 'LOCALAPPDATA', 'APPDATA', 'TEMP'), local file existence checks, and files related to 'exodus' wallet and configuration.",
  "sinks": "Writing files into a ZIP archive, sending a message and document through Telegram API, and deleting the ZIP file afterward.",
  "flows": "User info and wallet files are collected and compressed into a ZIP archive; if wallet files are present, the archive is sent to a Telegram chat, and then the archive is deleted.",
  "anomalies": "Code retrieves and compresses sensitive wallet files and configuration, then exfiltrates the archive via Telegram API. Usage of hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID, along with obfuscated or confusing variable names, are suspicious. The code also constructs environment-dependent paths for user directories, which suggests targeting specific user data. The code also tries to read the user's IP address and geolocation, then sends this info along with wallet data.",
  "analysis": "The code collects user environment variables and specific wallet-related files from the 'exodus' directory. It compresses these files into a ZIP archive. If the wallet directory exists, it retrieves the machine's IP address and country code, encodes the country code into emoji, and embeds this info into a message. It then posts this message and the ZIP file to a Telegram bot endpoint, suggesting data exfiltration. The code deletes the ZIP file after sending. The use of hardcoded Telegram tokens and chat IDs, along with access to sensitive wallet data, indicates malicious intent. The code does not perform any benign or intended application functions and primarily focuses on surreptitious data collection and exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "This script is designed to stealthily collect and exfiltrate sensitive wallet and configuration files along with system info via Telegram, indicating malicious intent. It uses obfuscated variable names, hardcoded credentials, and exploits user environment data to target specific files and send them externally, consistent with malware behavior.",
