{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information (username, current directory, hostname) and exfiltrates it via an HTTP POST request to a suspicious external URL.",
  "sources": "getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), socket.gethostname()",
  "sinks": "requests.post() to external URL with collected data",
  "flows": "Sources (system info) → Data sent via requests.post() to external server",
  "anomalies": "Unencrypted data transmission to a non-standard, suspicious URL without user consent or validation",
  "analysis": "The code straightforwardly gathers user and system info and transmits it to an external server without notification or encryption. No malicious code, obfuscation, or damage is present. The behavior resembles covert data exfiltration or tracking, raising privacy concerns. The URL is suspicious, and the lack of user consent prompts indicates privacy invasion. The malware score is low (0.2), reflecting no active malicious payloads, but the privacy implications are significant. The security risk score is moderate (around 0.6), justified by the covert exfiltration and suspicious URL. The code's simplicity and transparency mean obfuscation is not present. Overall, the behavior warrants caution but does not constitute active malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs covert data collection and exfiltration to a suspicious URL, raising privacy concerns. It does not contain malicious payloads or obfuscation. The scores of malware 0.2, obfuscated 0, and risk around 0.6 are appropriate and consistent with the behavior. It warrants caution due to privacy invasion but is not actively malicious.",
