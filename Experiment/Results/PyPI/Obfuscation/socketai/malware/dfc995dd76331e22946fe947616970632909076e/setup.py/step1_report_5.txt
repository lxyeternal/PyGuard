  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'f2fqsitomkfvo1ec'.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata from the 'setup' function parameters.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; does not perform any data output or untrusted operations.",
  "flows": "The setup function is called with static parameters; no data flows from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "Package name appears to be a random string, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No code obfuscation or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup utilities from setuptools and calls setup with static package name and version. There are no input streams, no code execution beyond standard setup invocation, and no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The package name does not follow typical semantic patterns and may be intentionally obfuscated or placeholder, but this alone is not malicious. Overall, the code is minimal and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward package setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The unusual package name warrants caution but does not indicate malicious intent.",
