{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information (hostname, username, current directory), encodes it with base64 and hex, then constructs obfuscated payloads which are sent via multiple network requests (ping, HTTP GET/POST) to suspicious domains, indicating covert data exfiltration or command-and-control activity.",
  "sources": [
    "os.uname() or environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' for hostname",
    "getpass.getuser() for username",
    "os.getcwd() for current directory"
  ],
  "sinks": [
    "os.system('ping ...') for network signaling",
    "urllib.request.urlopen and urllib.request.urlopen for HTTP requests",
    "urllib.urlopen for legacy URL requests",
    "requests.post and requests.get for HTTP communication"
  ],
  "flows": [
    "System info is gathered from sources -> encoded with base64 -> further obfuscated into hex strings -> combined into payloads -> transmitted via network requests to external domains"
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "Heavy obfuscation of variable names and encoding routines",
    "Repeated network requests using multiple libraries and methods",
    "Use of ping commands with encoded data for covert signaling",
    "Hardcoded suspicious domains (.sub.deliverycontent.online, www.deliverycontent.online)",
    "Multiple fallback mechanisms for network communication"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code performs system info collection, applies layered encoding and obfuscation, and exfiltrates data to external servers using various network methods, including ping and HTTP requests. The obfuscation and repeated attempts suggest an intent to evade detection. The activity aligns with malicious data theft or command-and-control communication, with no benign purpose evident. The use of multiple network techniques and obfuscation routines indicates high malicious intent and security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, designed for covert data exfiltration and command-and-control activities. It exhibits heavy obfuscation, multiple network exfiltration methods, and targets suspicious domains. The activity warrants immediate review and removal, and the scores assigned in the reports (malware: ~0.9, obfuscated: ~0.9, risk: ~0.9) are justified and consistent with its behavior.",
