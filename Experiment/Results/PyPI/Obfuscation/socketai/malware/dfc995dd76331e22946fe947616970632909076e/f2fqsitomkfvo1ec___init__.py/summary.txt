  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, designed for covert data exfiltration and command-and-control activities. It exhibits heavy obfuscation, multiple network exfiltration methods, and targets suspicious domains. The activity warrants immediate review and removal, and the scores assigned in the reports (malware: ~0.9, obfuscated: ~0.9, risk: ~0.9) are justified and consistent with its behavior."
