  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior through the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during package setup. The high scores assigned by the reports are appropriate, reflecting the significant security risk posed by this behavior. Further decoding of the payload is recommended to understand the full scope, but current evidence indicates a high probability of malicious intent."
