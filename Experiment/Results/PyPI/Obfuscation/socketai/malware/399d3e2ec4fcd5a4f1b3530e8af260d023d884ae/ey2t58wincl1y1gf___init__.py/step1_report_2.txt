  "purpose": "Simple arithmetic functions for addition and subtraction.",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'one' and 'two'.",

  "flows": "Parameters 'one' and 'two' are used directly in return statements.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual function name 'UxPcXxgaTxchTeGMJxfNyGMCFxDTWmED' appears obfuscated and intentionally complex, which is suspicious. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions: one for addition with a straightforward name, and another with an obfuscated name performing subtraction. The obfuscated function name suggests an attempt to hide intent or avoid detection. Both functions simply perform basic arithmetic operations on their parameters without any external data sources, sinks, or malicious behavior. The presence of an intentionally complex and non-descriptive function name is suspicious but does not necessarily indicate malicious behavior. Overall, the code appears benign but employs obfuscation techniques that warrant caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists of basic arithmetic functions with one function name intentionally obfuscated. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malicious data handling. The obfuscated function name is suspicious but does not imply malicious intent by itself.",
