  "purpose": "Define basic arithmetic functions for addition and subtraction.",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'one' and 'two'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating untrusted data processing or output.",
  "flows": "Parameters 'one' and 'two' flow into addition and subtraction operations.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a highly obfuscated function name 'UxPcXxgaTxchTeGMJxfNyGMCFxDTWmED' which performs subtraction, potentially intended to conceal its purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code contains two functions: one simple addition function with a clear, understandable name; and another with a very obfuscated name performing subtraction. The obfuscated function's name appears intentionally confusing, which can be a sign of attempts to hide functionality. Both functions perform basic arithmetic operations with no external input/output or network activity. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The obfuscation alone doesn't imply malicious intent but warrants caution as it could be used to hide malicious operations if combined with other code. No malicious code or malware patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists of simple arithmetic functions, with one function obfuscated via its name. There is no direct evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscated function name could be for concealment but does not by itself indicate malicious intent.",
