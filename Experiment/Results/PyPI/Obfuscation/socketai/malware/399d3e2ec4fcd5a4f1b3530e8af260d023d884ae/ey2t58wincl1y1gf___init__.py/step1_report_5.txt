{
  "purpose": "The code defines two basic arithmetic functions: addition and subtraction.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are read; functions take parameters but do not read external data.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, external communications, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows, as the functions only perform simple arithmetic operations on parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The function names appear intentionally obfuscated (one with a nonsensical name). No other unusual or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two simple arithmetic functions, one addition and one subtraction. The second function has a long, obfuscated name which might be a red flag, but it performs a basic subtraction operation. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration. The code is very minimal and does not include any suspicious logic or external interactions. The obfuscated function name alone does not constitute malicious intent without additional context.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs simple arithmetic operations with an obfuscated function name but shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation appears superficial and does not indicate malicious intent.",
