  "conclusion": "The code consists of benign utility functions with superficial obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation alone does not justify high risk scores, but it warrants monitoring if found in larger, complex codebases. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score should be low (~0.2)."
