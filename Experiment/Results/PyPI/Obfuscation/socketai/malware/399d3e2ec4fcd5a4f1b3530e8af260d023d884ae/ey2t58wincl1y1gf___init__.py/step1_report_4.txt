  "purpose": "Simple arithmetic functions for addition and subtraction.",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'one' and 'two' used as input data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; functions return computed values but do not perform further actions.",
  "flows": "Parameters 'one' and 'two' flow into basic arithmetic operations and are returned.",
  "anomalies": "Function name 'UxPcXxgaTxchTeGMJxfNyGMCFxDTWmED' appears obfuscated or auto-generated; no malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code contains two functions: a straightforward addition and a subtraction function with non-descriptive naming. No external data sources, no I/O, and no network activity are present. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are evident. The obfuscated function name might suggest an attempt to hide intent, but its implementation is simple arithmetic.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs basic arithmetic operations with no signs of malicious behavior. The obfuscated function name alone is not enough to indicate malicious intent. Overall, this appears to be harmless utility code.",
