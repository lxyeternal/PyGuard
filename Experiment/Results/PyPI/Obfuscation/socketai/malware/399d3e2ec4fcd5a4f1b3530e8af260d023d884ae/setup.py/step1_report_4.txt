{
  "purpose": "The script appears to set up environment and dependencies, then download and execute two executable files from remote URLs, potentially for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads network data via requests.get(), file operations like open() and os.remove(), environment variables and directory manipulations.",
  "sinks": "Writing to disk ('ZYXMN.exe', 'ZYRBX.exe'), renaming files, executing files with os.startfile(), deleting files/directories.",
  "flows": "Requests fetch remote executables -> Save files locally -> Rename files -> Execute files -> Clean up directories.",
  "anomalies": "Uses obfuscated variable names, downloads executables from Discord CDN, executes downloaded files without verification, creates and deletes files in suspicious directory, attempts to install requests and urllib.request via os.system if import fails, which is unnecessary and potentially dangerous.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools but does not use them meaningfully. It then creates a hidden directory ('C:\\$Windows.~SXK') and downloads two executables from Discord CDN links, saving them with hardcoded filenames. It moves and executes these files without validation, and cleans up by removing the directory. The use of such hardcoded URLs, obfuscated variable names, and execution of downloaded files strongly indicates malicious intent, potentially to install malware or perform unauthorized activities. The code does not perform any legitimate setup tasks, and the pattern of downloading and executing remote binaries is characteristic of malware behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious and exhibits behavior typical of malware—downloading, executing, and cleaning up remote executables without validation. The obfuscation and suspicious URL sources further increase concern. It should be classified as malicious with high confidence.",
