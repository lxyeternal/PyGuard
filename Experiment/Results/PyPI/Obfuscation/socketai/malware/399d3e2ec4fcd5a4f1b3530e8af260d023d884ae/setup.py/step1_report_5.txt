{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for package setup and installation, but it also contains suspicious behavior related to downloading and executing external files, likely malware.",
  "sources": "Requests to external URLs, import statements, and environment checks; reading and removing files from a specific directory.",
  "sinks": "Writing downloaded content to executable files, executing files with os.startfile, and deleting files/directories.",
  "flows": "Requests.get() downloads files from URLs -> files are written to disk -> files are renamed and executed -> deletion of files/directories occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, attempts to install modules if missing, creation of directory with suspicious naming, downloading executables from Discord CDN, renaming and executing them, and cleanup actions.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with package setup code, which appears benign. However, it then dynamically installs modules and proceeds to create a directory named '$Windows.~SXK'. It downloads two executable files from Discord CDN URLs and saves them into this directory, then renames and executes them. The code also attempts to delete the downloaded files and the directory afterward. The use of hardcoded URLs, renaming, and silent execution of downloaded files strongly indicates malicious intent, likely to deliver malware or backdoors. The variable names and code obfuscation hints are minimal but present, and the overall behavior aligns with typical malware patterns of remote payload delivery, persistence, and cleanup.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior by downloading, executing, and cleaning up suspicious executables from external sources, which likely contain malware. Its structure and actions strongly suggest an intent to compromise the host system.",
