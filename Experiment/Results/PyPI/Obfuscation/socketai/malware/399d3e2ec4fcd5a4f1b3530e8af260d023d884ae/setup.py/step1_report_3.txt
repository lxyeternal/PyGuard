    "Installation process includes malicious behavior disguised as setup"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code initially appears to be a standard setup script but includes embedded URLs pointing to potentially malicious executables hosted on Discord CDN. It attempts to download these files and rename them into a system directory (~SXK), which is likely used to hide malicious files. The script then executes these files using os.startfile(), indicating execution of remotely hosted malware. Additionally, it deletes the downloaded files and the entire directory afterward, covering tracks. The code's obfuscated variable names and the usage of system directories suggest malicious intent. The setup process itself is used as a vector to silently deploy malware onto the system.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits clear malicious behavior, including downloading, executing, and hiding malware files, as well as deleting system files and directories. It is highly dangerous and should not be used. It appears designed to compromise the system by deploying remote malicious executables.",
