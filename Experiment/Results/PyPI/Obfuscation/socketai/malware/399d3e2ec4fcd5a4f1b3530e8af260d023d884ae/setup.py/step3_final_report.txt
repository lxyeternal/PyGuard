{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to download two executable payloads from remote URLs, save them into a hidden system directory, execute them silently, and then delete the files and directory to cover tracks. It obfuscates variable names and attempts to install modules dynamically, indicating malicious intent to deliver and execute remote malware.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from hardcoded URLs ('https://cdn.discordapp.com/.../ZYXMN.exe' and 'https://cdn.discordapp.com/.../ZYRBX.exe') during requests.get calls. It also reads from the filesystem when removing files and creating directories.",
  "sinks": "Execution of downloaded files via os.startfile() acts as a sink where untrusted remote payloads are executed. File removal and directory cleanup are also sinks that could affect system state or cover malicious activity.",
  "flows": "The source URLs feed into requests.get(), which writes content to local files ('ZYXMN.exe' and 'ZYRBX.exe'). These files are then renamed and executed via os.startfile(). Afterwards, the files and directory are deleted, completing the malicious flow.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names with nonsensical strings, creation of a suspicious directory ('C:\\$Windows.~SXK'), silent exception handling, dynamic module installation, and the download of executables from Discord CDN are anomalies indicating obfuscation and malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with a standard setup call but then proceeds to download two executables from external URLs, saving them into a hidden system directory. It renames and executes these files silently, then deletes them and the directory. Variable names are obfuscated, and there are unnecessary attempts to install modules, which are suspicious. The code's behavior aligns with malware droppers or loaders designed to deliver remote payloads stealthily. The high use of exception handling and silent operations further suggest malicious intent. The activity is consistent with malware distribution tactics, with no legitimate purpose evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, functioning as a downloader and executor of remote malware payloads. It employs obfuscation, stealth techniques, and system directory manipulation to deliver malicious files, execute them, and cover its tracks. The behavior warrants a high malware score and security risk assessment.",
