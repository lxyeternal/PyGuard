{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, but it contains hidden malicious activities such as downloading and executing external files, and creating files in system directories.",
  "sources": "URL requests to download executable files from Discord CDN, reading and writing files on disk, importing modules like requests and subprocess.",
  "sinks": "Writing to system directories (C:\\$Windows.~SXK), executing downloaded files with os.startfile, removing files from system directories.",
  "flows": "Requests to download executables from URLs -> saving files to disk -> renaming files to system directory paths -> executing downloaded files -> deleting temporary files and directory.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, creation of a directory in a Windows system folder, downloading and executing files from external, suspicious URLs, overwriting and removing files in a system directory, use of broad exception handling that suppresses errors.",
  "analysis": "The code is designed to download two executable files from Discord CDN links, save them to a system directory, rename them to specific filenames, execute them, and then clean up temporary files and directories. The obfuscated variable names and the use of a directory named 'C:\\$Windows.~SXK' (which resembles a system folder but is likely malicious) indicate malicious intent. The code operates without user consent, potentially installing and executing malicious payloads. It also attempts to hide its actions by suppressing errors and obfuscating file paths. The setup-related code and the installation of requests are likely decoys or initial steps, but the core activity involves malicious download, execution, and cleanup, strongly suggesting malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, designed to download and execute malicious payloads from external URLs, hide files in a system directory, and execute them without user consent. The obfuscated variables, silent error handling, and the download behavior are typical indicators of malicious software or supply chain attack vectors.",
