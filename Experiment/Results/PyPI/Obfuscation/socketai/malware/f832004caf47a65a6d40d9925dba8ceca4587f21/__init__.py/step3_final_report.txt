{
  "purpose": "Simple function that prints 'installed' and is called immediately, likely a placeholder or status indicator.",
  "sources": "Function definition and call; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs involved.",
  "flows": "Function call flows directly to print statement; no external data flow or malicious data transfer.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function name; minimal code with no malicious behavior; no data leaks or system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code defines and invokes a function with an obfuscated name that outputs a static message. It contains no external data sources, network activity, or system modifications. The obfuscated name raises suspicion but does not indicate malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, with the main concern being the obfuscation. Malware scores are consistently zero, reflecting no malicious activity. Obfuscation scores vary but are justified given the function name. Security risk scores are very low, indicating minimal threat. The code appears to be a benign placeholder with obfuscated naming, not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior. The obfuscated function name warrants a moderate obfuscation score but does not elevate the malware or security risk. Overall, the code poses negligible security concern.",
