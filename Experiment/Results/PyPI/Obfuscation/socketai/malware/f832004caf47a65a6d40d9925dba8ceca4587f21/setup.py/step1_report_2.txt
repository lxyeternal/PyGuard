{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, but it includes hidden malicious behavior such as downloading and executing a potentially harmful executable from an external server.",
  "sources": "The environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' and requests to 'https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php', as well as the URL 'https://python-release.com/python-install.scr' which is used to download and run an executable file.",
  "sinks": "Writing downloaded content to a file and executing it with os.system('start ...') constitutes the sink where untrusted external code is executed, potentially malicious.",
  "flows": "The script reads the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable (source), sends it along with a request to a remote server, then conditionally downloads and executes a remote executable (sink), with the request and execution flow embedded in the custom installation command.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated function and class names, hidden network activity within setup scripts, downloading and executing an executable during package installation, which is highly unusual and suspicious behavior for a standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules 'setuptools' and 'os', along with 'requests'. It defines a function that retrieves the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable and sends it to a remote server, then conditionally downloads and executes a file from a suspicious URL if running on Windows. This behavior is hidden within a setup script intended for package installation, which is an unusual and malicious tactic. The class overrides the install command to include this malicious routine. The URLs used are suspicious and indicate potential malware delivery. The code's obfuscated naming and hidden execution flow suggest intent to conceal malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script contains malicious behavior by secretly downloading and executing a remote executable during package installation, likely for malicious purposes. The overall risk is high due to these behaviors, and the code should be considered dangerous.",
