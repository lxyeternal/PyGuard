  "security_risk": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious intent due to obfuscated, hidden execution of a command during setup. While the exact payload cannot be confirmed without decoding, the pattern aligns with common malware tactics. The high obfuscation and silent execution justify a malware score of 0.75, an obfuscation score of 0.9, and a security risk score of 0.8, indicating a significant security concern that warrants further investigation or sandbox testing."
