  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior: remote payload download, local file manipulation, and execution with obfuscation and unsafe practices. It is highly likely to be malware, with a high security risk. The obfuscation score is justified, and the malware score should be set to 1. The overall security risk score should also be at maximum due to the active malicious activity."
