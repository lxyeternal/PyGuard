{
  "purpose": "Defines a data class containing color and terminal control sequences, color mappings, and color codes for terminal display customization.",
  "sources": "No input sources; all data are class attributes and static mappings.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to external systems or untrusted outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code only initializes static dictionaries and constants.",
  "anomalies": "Contains extensive static mappings for colors and control sequences; no hardcoded credentials, network activity, or suspicious code structures. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward data class containing terminal escape sequences and color mappings. No external inputs, outputs, or network communications are present. The class appears to be used for styling terminal output, with extensive predefined color codes and control sequences. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads. No obfuscated or suspicious code constructs observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static data container for terminal styling, with no malicious or security risk indicators. It does not perform any suspicious or harmful actions. The extensive color mappings could be used for aesthetic terminal applications but do not pose security concerns.",
