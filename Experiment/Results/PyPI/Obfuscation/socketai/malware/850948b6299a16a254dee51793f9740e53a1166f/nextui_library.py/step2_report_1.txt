  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core points: presence of malicious activity, obfuscation, and security risk, as well as logical consistency.\n\n**Summary of findings from reports:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is static, mainly defining constants, dictionaries, and escape sequences for terminal styling.\n- No input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or backdoors are detected.\n- Obfuscation appears only in variable/class names, which are nonsensical or obfuscated but do not impact security.\n- Malware scores are consistently zero across reports.\n- Confidence levels are high, with some noting obfuscation (up to 0.7), but that alone does not imply malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and logical consistency:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, the code is purely static configuration data.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No logical errors or malicious flaws are evident.\n- **Scores for malware and risk:** All reports assign zero malware risk, which aligns with the static, benign nature.\n- **Obfuscation:** Variable names are obfuscated but that does not indicate malicious behavior.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:** No, the reports correctly avoid assumptions about malicious intent.\n\n### Critical assessment:\n\n- The code is a collection of static mappings for terminal styling, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- The obfuscation of variable names seems intentional but superficial; it does not hide any malicious behavior.\n- No data flow, input, or output points exist that could be exploited.\n- The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n- The security risk score is low (0 or 0.1), reflecting the static, benign nature.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The scores given in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n- No adjustments needed for the scores.\n- The high confidence levels are justified given the static, non-malicious nature.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.2 (variable names are obfuscated but that’s superficial)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal security risk, mostly static configuration)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign utility module for terminal styling, with no malware, no obfuscation that indicates malicious intent, and negligible security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Estimated Value | Justification                                              |\n|------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                 | No malicious behavior, static data only                     |\n| Obfuscated       | 0.2               | Variable names are obfuscated but harmless                  |\n| Security Risk    | 0.1               | Static configuration, no external dependencies or data flow |\n\n**Overall, the code is safe, benign, and intended solely for styling terminal output.**",
