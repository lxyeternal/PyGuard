{
  "purpose": "This code defines a set of classes and dictionaries for terminal color and style management, likely intended for styling output in terminal applications.",
  "sources": "No input or data sources are explicitly read or processed; all data is statically defined within the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or vulnerable points where untrusted data affects external systems or leaks information; the code solely defines constants and mappings.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from external sources to sinks; the code is static and does not process or manipulate input data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. The data dictionaries are extensive but static mappings for colors and styles. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a dataclass containing various terminal styling constants, color codes, and mapping dictionaries for ANSI escape sequences and color codes, primarily for styling terminal output. All elements are static and do not perform any operations or data processing. There are no input sources, external calls, or data flows. No malicious behaviors, backdoors, or security risks are evident. The code is well-structured for styling purposes and appears to be a utility module.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign utility for terminal styling with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is purely static and defines constants for styling output. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or sabotage evident.",
