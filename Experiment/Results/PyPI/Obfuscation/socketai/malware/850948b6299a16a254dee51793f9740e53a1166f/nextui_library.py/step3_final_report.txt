{
  "purpose": "Static configuration class defining terminal styling escape sequences, color mappings, and related constants.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; static class variables and dictionaries serve as data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data handling or external data output present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; all data are static constants and mappings.",
  "anomalies": "Variable and class names are obfuscated or nonsensical, but this is superficial and does not impact functionality or security.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely static, defining constants and dictionaries for terminal styling purposes. No input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution exists. Obfuscation in naming is superficial and does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present. The malware score is appropriately zero, and the security risk is negligible. The obfuscation score is slightly elevated due to variable naming but is not indicative of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static utility module for terminal styling with no malicious activity, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. Obfuscation is superficial and does not imply malicious intent. The overall security risk is minimal.",
