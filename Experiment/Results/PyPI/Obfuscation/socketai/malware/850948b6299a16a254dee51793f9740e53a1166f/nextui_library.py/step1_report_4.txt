{
  "purpose": "Define a data class containing various terminal escape sequences, color mappings, and related constants for styling terminal output.",
  "sources": "Class attribute initializations with hardcoded string literals and dictionaries containing color codes and control sequences.",
  "sinks": "No evident sink points where untrusted data flows or could cause security issues; no input or external data processing present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow; all code consists of static definitions and mappings.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials or secrets, and no network operations or file manipulations. Class and variable names appear obfuscated but are static and do not perform any malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a data class with various attributes mapping escape sequences and color codes for terminal styling. No input handling, no external data fetching, no execution of untrusted code. The obfuscated class and variable names are consistent with static data definitions. There are no apparent malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, network connections, or system modifications. The code is purely static and appears to serve as a styling or utility library.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. It is a static configuration class for terminal styling, with no signs of sabotage, malware, or data leakage. The obfuscation appears intentional for naming but does not affect security.",
