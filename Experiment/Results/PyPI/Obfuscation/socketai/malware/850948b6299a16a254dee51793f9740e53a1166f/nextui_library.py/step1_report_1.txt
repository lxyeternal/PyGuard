{
  "purpose": "Defines a dataclass containing color codes, escape sequences, and mappings related to terminal styling and colors, likely for terminal output formatting.",
  "sources": "No input reading or data input sources detected; all data is hardcoded within the class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not process or output data to external systems or network resources.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code solely defines static configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The class contains extensive color mappings and escape sequences but no suspicious or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists entirely of a dataclass with multiple dictionaries and string constants defining terminal color codes, escape sequences, and color mappings. There are no functions, input/output operations, or network communications. The data appears to serve a terminal styling purpose. No code execution or data manipulation occurs, and there are no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and solely provides configuration data for terminal color styling. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are present based on the provided code fragment.",
