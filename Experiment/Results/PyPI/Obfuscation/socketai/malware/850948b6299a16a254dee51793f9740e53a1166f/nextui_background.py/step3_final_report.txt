  "purpose": "Color management and styling functions, involving color constants and formatting strings.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for color functions, class variables referencing color constants.",
  "sinks": "String formatting for color output, dynamic attribute creation via vars().",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> color string formatting functions -> output color strings.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with meaningless class/variable names, dynamic variable assignment, undefined variables (_code, color), incomplete exception handling referencing 'InvalidColor'.",
  "analysis": "The code manages color constants and formatting, with obfuscated identifiers and dynamic attribute creation. It references undefined variables and has incomplete exception handling, indicating either placeholder or intentionally confusing code. No network activity, data exfiltration, or system modification is evident. The obfuscation and incomplete parts could be used to conceal malicious intent, but no direct malicious behavior is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, primarily related to color styling, with heavy obfuscation possibly for concealment. No active malicious activity is evident, but the obfuscation and incomplete code warrant cautious review. Malware score is set to 0, security risk is low, but obfuscation is high.",
