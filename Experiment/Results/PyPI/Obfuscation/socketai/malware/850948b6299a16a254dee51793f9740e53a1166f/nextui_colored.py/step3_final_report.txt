  "purpose": "Terminal styling utility managing colors, styles, and console modes with platform-specific handling.",
  "sources": "Environment variables ('FORCE_COLOR', 'NO_COLOR'), platform-specific console mode functions, input parameters for style functions.",
  "sinks": "Generated escape sequences for terminal output, console mode modifications on Windows.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and input parameters influence style formatting; platform-specific functions modify console modes; style functions generate escape sequences based on internal state.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names, some functions reference undefined variables ('color', 'g'), potential bugs; platform-specific console mode adjustments are standard but could be misused.",
  "analysis": "The code is a terminal styling library that adjusts console modes on Windows and generates styled strings based on environment variables and input. Obfuscation is superficial, aimed at hiding variable names, not malicious. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. Some functions contain bugs or incomplete code, but these do not impact security assessment. Overall, the code is benign, serving a legitimate purpose, with low security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign terminal styling utility with superficial obfuscation. No malicious activity or backdoors are detected. The platform-specific console handling is standard for enabling color support. The obfuscation does not imply malicious intent but could be improved for clarity. Overall, the security risk is low.",
