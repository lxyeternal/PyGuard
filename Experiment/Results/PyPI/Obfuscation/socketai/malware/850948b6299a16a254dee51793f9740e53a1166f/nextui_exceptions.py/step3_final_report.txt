{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes with obfuscated names, likely for concealment or obfuscation purposes.",
  "sources": "No data input, output, or external data sources; only class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data leaks, network activity, or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flow; class constructors are isolated, with no data processing or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class names, incorrect use of super() in constructors (`super(Exception, self).__init__(message)`), which may cause runtime errors or indicate obfuscation or poor coding.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of four custom exception classes with obfuscated names. The constructors incorrectly call super(), which is a coding flaw but not malicious. No malicious behavior, network activity, or data leaks are evident. The obfuscation and constructor misuse are suspicious but could be accidental or intentional obfuscation. The malware score is 0, consistent with the absence of malicious code. The obfuscation score is high (~0.75), reflecting the obfuscated class names and flawed super() calls. The security risk score is low (~0.2), given no active malicious activity but some suspicion due to obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be obfuscated exception class definitions with flawed superclass calls. There is no evidence of malicious intent or active malicious behavior. The obfuscation and constructor errors could be deliberate or accidental, but they do not constitute malware. The overall security risk is low, though obfuscation warrants further review if part of a larger codebase.",
