{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes with obfuscated class names for use in other parts of a larger application.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources such as user input, environment variables, or external data reads.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external system interactions present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only declares exception classes without any data processing or flow control.",
  "anomalies": "The class names are highly obfuscated, which could be an attempt to conceal purpose. No functional anomalies or malicious behaviors are evident from class definitions alone.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of four custom exception class definitions with obfuscated class names and straightforward constructors. The super() calls are incorrectly implemented (super(Exception, self) instead of super().__init__), but this does not introduce malicious behavior. The obfuscation of class names is suspicious but not inherently malicious. No data input, external interactions, or suspicious operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be simple class definitions for custom exceptions, with obfuscated class names possibly to hide their purpose. There is no indication of malicious behavior or security risks within this snippet. The obfuscation could be for hiding purpose or obfuscation but does not automatically imply malicious intent.",
