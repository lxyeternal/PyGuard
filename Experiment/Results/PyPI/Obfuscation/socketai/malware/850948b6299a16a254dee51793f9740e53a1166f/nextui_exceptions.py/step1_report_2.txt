  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes with obfuscated names for potential use in a larger application.",
  "sources": "None; no data input or external data reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or output functions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists; the code solely defines classes without any execution logic or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Exception class names are intentionally obfuscated, which could be an attempt to conceal purpose. The classes do not contain any functional code or external interactions. The __init__ methods incorrectly call super(Exception, self).__init__(message) instead of super().__init__(message), which may cause issues but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines four custom exception classes with obfuscated names, possibly to conceal their purpose or avoid easy detection. They inherit from Exception and override __str__ to return the message. The misuse of super() could lead to runtime errors but does not suggest malicious activity. There are no input/output operations, network communications, or data processing present. The code appears to be a standalone snippet for exception handling with obfuscated identifiers.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely defines obfuscated custom exception classes with no data handling or external interactions. The obfuscation and unusual class naming may be for concealment but do not inherently indicate malicious behavior. No malicious code, backdoors, or security risks are evident in this fragment.",
