  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for use within other code modules.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; the code only defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or output present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; classes are only definitions with no instantiation or usage shown.",
  "anomalies": "Class names are obfuscated and meaningless, which can indicate code obfuscation or malicious intent. Constructor calls super() with the wrong class (should be super().__init__(message)). No apparent malicious behavior, but the obfuscation and misuse of super() are suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines four custom exception classes with obfuscated names, each inheriting from Exception. The constructors attempt to initialize the superclass with super(Exception, self).__init__(message), which is incorrect; it should be super().__init__(message). The obfuscated class names and incorrect superclass calls are unusual, potentially indicating an attempt to hide malicious intent or obfuscate functionality. There is no active malicious behavior or malicious code present in the snippets shown. The code itself does not perform any network activity, data access, or other risky operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily consists of obfuscated exception class definitions with flawed superclass initialization. There is no evidence of malicious activity, but the obfuscation and constructor errors are suspicious and could be part of broader malicious or obfuscated code. The risk level is low but warrants cautious review if part of a larger codebase.",
