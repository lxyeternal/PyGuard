  "purpose": "A terminal styling utility that applies color and formatting to text and outputs it via print.",
  "sources": "Parameters for text, foreground/background colors, styling options, and imported styling functions from '.colored'.",
  "sinks": "The print function outputs styled text to stdout.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed into style strings, which are concatenated with the text and printed.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names; no malicious code, network activity, or data exfiltration detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function for styling and printing text with optional colors and formatting, relying on external styling functions. No suspicious behaviors, secrets, or malicious payloads are present. Obfuscation is notable but appears to serve to conceal variable names rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign terminal styling utility with obfuscated identifiers. No evidence of malicious activity or security threats. The obfuscation is moderate but not indicative of malicious behavior. The current malware score of 0.0 and low security risk score are appropriate.",
