No evidence of backdoors, data theft, or malicious sabotage is present. The low malware and risk scores are appropriate, with a high obfuscation score reflecting the naming obscurity."

No active malicious activity is evident, but the obfuscation and incomplete code warrant cautious review. Malware score is set to 0, security risk is low, but obfuscation is high."

It is highly likely to be malware, with a high security risk. The obfuscation score is justified, and the malware score should be set to 1. The overall security risk score should also be at maximum due to the active malicious activity."

The overall security risk is low, and malware likelihood is negligible. The obfuscation score is moderate due to cryptic naming, but the functionality is standard for styling libraries."
