  "purpose": "Terminal color formatting utility classes and functions for console output, with dynamic attribute creation based on external constants.",
  "sources": "External constants from imported modules (_COLORS, _FOREGROUND_256, _FOREGROUND_RGB), class attribute assignments, method parameters for color values.",
  "sinks": "String formatting functions generating color codes; no external data or untrusted input handling observed.",
  "flows": "Class attributes initialized from external constants; methods generate formatted color strings using these attributes.",
  "anomalies": "Exception method references undefined variables 'InvalidColor' and 'color'; dynamic attribute creation via 'vars()' based on external '_COLORS' dictionary; obfuscated class and variable names; no network or data exfiltration activities.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for terminal color formatting, utilizing external constants for color codes. An exception-raising method references undefined variables, indicating incomplete or buggy code but not malicious intent. Dynamic attribute creation with 'vars()' is unusual but not malicious. Obfuscation appears to be an attempt to obscure variable names rather than conceal malicious behavior. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious code patterns are present. The code's primary function is benign utility for console output formatting. The undefined variables are bugs that should be fixed but do not suggest malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for terminal color formatting with some obfuscation and minor bugs. There is no evidence of malware, malicious sabotage, or supply chain compromise. The obfuscation appears intentional but not malicious. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score remains at 0.",
