  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, stdin, network calls, subprocesses, and code execution points.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file operations, environment variables, subprocess calls, eval/exec functions.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables and stdin flow into processing functions; no malicious sinks are activated.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns detected; code appears benign.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify the absence or benign nature of code snippets. Scores for malware and obfuscation are consistently zero, aligning with the lack of malicious indicators. Security risk scores of 0.2 are slightly cautious but acceptable; minor adjustments to 0.1 could better reflect the benign assessments. Confidence levels are high, given the descriptions. No suspicious flows or anomalies are present. Overall, the code shows no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no malicious behavior or obfuscation detected. The current scoring is appropriate; minor risk score reductions could improve precision. All reports are consistent and justified based on the provided information.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
