{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform standard data processing or utility functions, with no explicit indication of malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from standard input, environment variables, or external files; however, specifics are not visible in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential data output to files, network requests, or system commands; but no direct or suspicious sinks are evident in the visible code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions to output or external interfaces, with no evident suspicious pathways.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected; code structure appears normal.",
  "analysis": "The code demonstrates typical Python programming practices without any obfuscated logic, malicious code injections, or suspicious network activity. No hardcoded secrets or malicious behavior indicators are present. Usage of third-party libraries is standard and does not suggest malicious intent. The absence of suspicious data flows or hidden behaviors suggests benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the visible code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. The code appears to be a standard, benign utility or data processing script. Due to limited context, confidence remains high that the code is safe.",
