{
  "purpose": "The code collects all environment variables and exfiltrates them to a remote webhook during package setup, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "All environment variables via os.environ",
  "sinks": "HTTP request to https://webhook.site/8f782c5b-990f-4d3d-94cc-fd128b873693",
  "flows": "Environment variables are gathered, URL-encoded, and sent via an HTTP POST request during both install and develop commands",
  "anomalies": "Execution of network request during package setup, obfuscated variable and function names, printing environment variables to console",
  "analysis": "The code defines setup commands that invoke a function collecting all environment variables and sending them to an external URL. The function is called during both install and develop commands, which are executed during package installation or development setup. Variable names are obfuscated, indicating an attempt to hide malicious activity. The exfiltration of environment variables, potentially containing sensitive data, is a serious security concern. The code does not perform other malicious actions but the exfiltration alone warrants high suspicion. The high malware score (1.0), high security risk (1.0), and obfuscation score (~0.8) are justified based on this behavior. The activity is consistent with malicious sabotage or data theft, with high confidence in malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, exfiltrating environment variables during package setup, which poses a significant security threat. The high scores are justified, and the activity warrants immediate attention and removal from supply chains.",
