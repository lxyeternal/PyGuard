{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package with custom install and develop commands, and includes a function that exfiltrates environment variables to an external URL.",
  "sources": "Environment variables are read via os.environ.",
  "sinks": "The environment variables are URL-encoded and sent via an HTTP request to an external webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are collected as input, then encoded and sent over the network to the specified webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "The function xRuTWflEcJnzYxDfWkqPZdhnRPdQZpWh() unconditionally exfiltrates environment variables to an external server, which is suspicious and indicative of malicious activity. The code also prints the environment variables to the console. The class methods invoke this function during installation and development, meaning it executes during package setup. The overall code structure includes obfuscated variable names, but no obfuscated code per se.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup tools but introduces a function that captures all environment variables, encodes them, and sends them via a POST request to an external URL. This action could be used for sensitive data exfiltration, such as environment variables that might contain credentials or other secrets. The function is invoked during package installation and development commands, meaning it executes whenever the package is installed or set up in development mode. There are no other signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads beyond this data exfiltration. The rest of the code is standard package setup with intentionally obfuscated variable names, which may be an attempt to hide malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious behavior: exfiltration of environment variables to an external server during package installation or development. This behavior indicates a high likelihood of malicious intent, potentially used for stealing sensitive data. The obfuscated variable names and unconditional execution during setup suggest malicious sabotage or backdoor activity.",
