{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package with custom install and develop commands.",
  "sources": "The environment variables are read via os.environ, and data is sent via a URL request to a specific webhook URL.",
  "sinks": "The environment variables are URL-encoded and sent over an HTTP request to an external webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> URL encoding -> HTTP request to webhook URL",
  "anomalies": "The function xRuTWflEcJnzYxDfWkqPZdhnRPdQZpWh() collects environment variables, encodes them, and sends them to a remote server, which is unusual behavior for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools and defines custom classes inheriting from develop and install commands, which also invoke a function that collects all environment variables, encodes them, and sends the data to an external webhook. This behavior is not typical or necessary for package installation and suggests data exfiltration. The environment variables may include sensitive data. The code does not sanitize or restrict data sent, and the URL is a webhook site, potentially used for malicious data collection.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by exfiltrating environment variables to an external server during package installation or development setup. This is suspicious and indicates potential malicious intent or a supply chain attack vector.",
