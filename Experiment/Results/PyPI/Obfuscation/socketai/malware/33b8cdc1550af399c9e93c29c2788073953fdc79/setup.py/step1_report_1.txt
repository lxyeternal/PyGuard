{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup procedures for a Python package, including custom install and develop commands that execute a function to send environment variables to a remote webhook.",
  "sources": "Environment variables accessed via os.environ",
  "sinks": "HTTP request to a remote webhook URL with encoded environment variables",
  "flows": "Reading environment variables -> URL encoding -> sending HTTP POST request to webhook",
  "anomalies": "The code collects all environment variables and transmits them to a remote server without user consent, which is suspicious. The use of obfuscated variable names and functions, along with the execution of network requests during package setup, are unusual.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools and overrides development and installation commands to include a function that collects environment variables. This function encodes all environment variables and sends them via an HTTP request to a specific webhook URL, potentially leaking sensitive data. The custom command classes invoke this function during package setup, which is unusual and suspicious behavior. No other malicious actions such as system modifications or data exfiltration are observed. The code's obfuscation through random variable names and the direct data exfiltration during package installation strongly indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code secretly exfiltrates environment variables to an external webhook during package installation or development setup, which could lead to sensitive data leakage. The use of obfuscation and the timing of data transmission raise high suspicion of malicious activity.",
