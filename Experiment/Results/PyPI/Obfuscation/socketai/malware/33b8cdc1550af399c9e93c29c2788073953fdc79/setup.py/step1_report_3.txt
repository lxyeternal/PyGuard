{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package installation process and includes code to exfiltrate environment variables to an external URL during installation or development.",
  "sources": "The environment variables are read via os.environ in the function xRuTWflEcJnzYxDfWkqPZdhnRPdQZpWh().",
  "sinks": "Data is sent via an HTTP request to a specified webhook URL, potentially leaking sensitive environment data.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are collected, URL-encoded, and then sent to an external server during package installation or development.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains obfuscated function and variable names, uses custom subclassing for install and develop commands, and performs data exfiltration without any legitimate purpose or user consent.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and overrides install and develop commands to include a function that collects environment variables and sends them to an external webhook URL. This behavior occurs during package installation or development, which is unusual and suspicious. The obfuscated naming further indicates malicious intent or sabotage. No other legitimate setup functionalities are affected; the core setup uses standard functions, but the side-channel exfiltration is malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, designed to exfiltrate environment variables during package installation or development by sending data to an external webhook. The obfuscation and side-effects indicate malicious intent, and it poses a significant security risk.",
