      "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear signs of malicious activity, primarily through the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command conditioned on filesystem state. The high obfuscation, silent error handling, and covert execution strongly suggest malicious intent. While decoding the payload would confirm the exact behavior, the current evidence justifies high malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores. The code should be treated as malicious or highly suspicious until further analysis is performed."
