{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be setting up a Python package and executing a PowerShell command to perform some background operation, possibly malicious.",
  "sources": "os.path.exists('tahg') check, subprocess.Popen call with encoded PowerShell command",
  "sinks": "subprocess.Popen executing an encoded PowerShell command, potentially executing malicious code",
  "flows": "Check if 'tahg' exists -> If not, run encoded PowerShell command -> Proceed with setup",
  "anomalies": "Encoded PowerShell command executed via subprocess, no error handling on command execution, suspicious use of hidden window and encoded command",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing setup from distutils and attempting to import subprocess and os modules. It checks if a file or directory named 'tahg' exists. If not, it runs a PowerShell command encoded in Base64 through subprocess.Popen with hidden window options. This command is likely obfuscated and may contain malicious payloads. The setup() function is called with package metadata, but the prior code execution suggests an attempt to hide or execute malicious activity before package installation. Error handling is broad and silent, offering no visibility into failures. The encoded PowerShell command, if decoded, could reveal malicious actions such as data exfiltration, persistence, or other harmful activities. The script’s overall behavior indicates a high likelihood of malicious intent, especially given the obfuscation and hidden execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated and potentially malicious PowerShell execution that triggers if 'tahg' does not exist, likely aiming to execute hidden commands. The setup process appears normal but is preceded by suspicious activity that warrants suspicion. Overall, this script exhibits malicious behavior with high confidence.",
