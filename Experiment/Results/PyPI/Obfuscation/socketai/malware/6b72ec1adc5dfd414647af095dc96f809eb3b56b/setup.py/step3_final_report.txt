{
  "purpose": "The code executes a base64-encoded payload during installation, which is obfuscated and dynamically executed via exec().",
  "sources": "The __import__('base64').b64decode() payload within the overridden install class method.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing the decoded payload, which imports modules and performs network or system operations.",
  "flows": "The payload is decoded from base64 and directly executed via exec(), running potentially malicious code during setup.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names, base64 encoding, dynamic execution during installation, and import of modules like os and subprocess within the payload.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a class that overrides the install command, executing a base64-encoded string decoded at runtime with exec(). The payload imports modules, sets up logging, and performs network operations, indicative of malicious activity. The obfuscation and dynamic execution during setup are classic indicators of supply chain malicious behavior. The high scores assigned in the reports (near 1 for malware, obfuscation, and risk) are justified by these indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates malicious intent through obfuscated, dynamically executed payloads during installation, representing a high security threat. The scores are consistent with the observed behavior, and the package should be flagged as malicious.",
