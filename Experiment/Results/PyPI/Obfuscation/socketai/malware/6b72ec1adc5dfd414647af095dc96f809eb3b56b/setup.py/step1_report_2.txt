{
  "purpose": "The script is intended to set up a Python package named 'o6z498sug22e6gzi' with version 1.0.0, including some metadata and dependencies, and to run a custom installation procedure.",
  "sources": "Data is read from the 'README.md' file and environment during setup; input is also derived from the base64-decoded code embedded within the custom install class.",
  "sinks": "Potentially malicious code is executed via the 'exec' function on the decoded base64 string, which can run arbitrary code, possibly malicious.",
  "flows": "Input from the base64-encoded string flows directly into 'exec', which executes the code without sanitization, creating a direct source-to-sink flow.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains obfuscated base64-encoded string that, when decoded, appears to import modules, create objects, and run code dynamically. The presence of such obfuscation and execution of decoded code is suspicious. The variable names are random and not descriptive. The code bypasses typical execution flow, suggesting an attempt to hide malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with a standard setup configuration for a Python package, including reading a README file. However, it then defines a custom install class that overrides the 'fhIxphFMfcrShfkCVFsobVrHxrWhQtTX' method, which attempts to execute code decoded from a base64 string. This decoded code imports modules, sets up logging, and executes further code, which could be malicious, including network operations or code injection. The use of 'exec' on decoded base64 content is a common tactic in malicious scripts to hide malicious intent. No other suspicious or malicious activity is directly observable from the setup code itself, but the dynamic execution strongly indicates malicious or at least suspicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is mostly standard setup boilerplate, but it contains a hidden, obfuscated payload that executes dynamically decoded code. This behavior is characteristic of malicious or at least suspicious activity, as it could execute arbitrary and potentially harmful code at installation time. The overall risk is high due to the obfuscated code and execution of decoded payload.",
