{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be setting up a Python package with a custom install command that executes obfuscated code during installation.",
  "sources": "The obfuscated base64-encoded string executed within the custom install command.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the decoded code, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution during package installation.",
  "flows": "The setup process calls the custom install command which executes the decoded base64 code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated base64 code executed via 'exec' during installation; presence of nonsensical variable names; code reads a 'README.md' file but this is standard, the main concern is the embedded payload.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools, defines a custom install class that overrides the 'install' command. Inside this class, during the 'fhIxphFMfcrShfkCVFsobVrHxrWhQtTX' method, it decodes a base64 string and executes it with 'exec'. The decoded code imports 'os' and 'subprocess', and appears to perform unauthorized or malicious actions, such as potentially executing malicious payloads or backdoors during package installation. The presence of obfuscated code and the execution of decoded payload during install strongly suggest malicious intent or malicious behavior. The setup function defines a package with arbitrary, nonsensical names, further indicating possible malicious obfuscation. Overall, this code appears designed to execute hidden malicious code during installation, which could be used for system compromise, backdoors, or other malicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains malicious behavior, specifically executing obfuscated code during installation, which could compromise the target system. The code is intentionally obfuscated to hide malicious payloads, and the execution during setup indicates high risk.",
