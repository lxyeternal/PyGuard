{
  "purpose": "This script sets up a Python package with some obfuscated code that executes a base64-decoded payload during installation.",
  "sources": "The payload executed in the 'fhIxphFMfcrShfkCVFsobVrHxrWhQtTX' method, which reads data from the base64-encoded string.",
  "sinks": "The code executes dynamically decoded code via 'exec', which could run arbitrary code from the base64 string, a potential security risk.",
  "flows": "The installation process calls the custom install class method that executes the decoded payload, potentially running malicious code during package installation.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains obfuscated variable names, a base64-encoded payload, and dynamic execution of decoded code, all of which are suspicious indicators. The payload appears to import modules, set up logging, and perform network operations, which are common in malicious scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script uses 'setuptools' for package setup, but includes an obfuscated class that overrides the install command. Within this class, it attempts to execute a base64-encoded string decoded at runtime, which imports system modules and appears to perform network or system operations. The obfuscation, combined with dynamic code execution, strongly suggests malicious intent or backdoor functionality embedded in the package. The payload could potentially perform unauthorized actions such as data exfiltration, system modification, or network communication without user awareness.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains highly suspicious, obfuscated code that executes a payload during installation, indicating a high likelihood of malicious behavior. The code's structure and dynamic execution point towards intentional sabotage or malware. Caution is advised before using this package.",
