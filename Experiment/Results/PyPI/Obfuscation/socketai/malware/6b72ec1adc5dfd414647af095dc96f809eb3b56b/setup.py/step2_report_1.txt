  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n**Purpose:** Obfuscated code executes during installation via base64-decoded payload.  \n**Malware Score:** 0.9  \n**Obfuscated:** 1  \n**Risk Score:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The code contains a class that overrides the install command, executing a base64 payload with `exec()`.  \n- The payload imports modules, sets up logging, and performs network operations, which are common in malicious scripts.  \n- The high malware and risk scores are justified given the obfuscation and dynamic code execution during install.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's scores are reasonable and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n**Purpose:** Similar setup with obfuscated base64 code executed during installation.  \n**Malware Score:** 0.8  \n**Obfuscated:** 0.9  \n**Risk Score:** 0.8\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The setup appears standard but includes a custom install class executing decoded code via `exec()`.  \n- The decoded code imports modules and potentially performs malicious actions.  \n- The high confidence and scores are appropriate, considering the obfuscation and dynamic execution.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n**Purpose:** Obfuscated code executed during install via base64 payload.  \n**Malware Score:** 1  \n**Obfuscated:** 1  \n**Risk Score:** 1\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The code explicitly executes obfuscated payloads during setup.  \n- The payload imports modules like `os` and `subprocess`, indicating potential malicious activity.  \n- The high scores are justified; this is clearly malicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are appropriate and reflect the malicious nature.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n**Purpose:** Obfuscated base64 code executed during installation.  \n**Malware Score:** 0.9  \n**Obfuscated:** 0.8  \n**Risk Score:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Similar pattern: obfuscated base64 payload executed via `exec()` during setup.  \n- The payload appears designed to perform malicious actions, such as data exfiltration or system compromise.  \n- The high scores are justified given the obfuscation and malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are reasonable and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n**Purpose:** Obfuscated payload executed during setup, potentially downloading/executing remote code.  \n**Malware Score:** 1  \n**Obfuscated:** 1  \n**Risk Score:** 1\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The code uses obfuscated base64-encoded strings executed via `exec()`.  \n- The payload likely downloads or runs malicious code, which is typical in backdoors or malware.  \n- The high scores are justified.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- All reports identify the core issue: obfuscated base64-encoded code executed during setup, which is a classic indicator of malicious activity.\n- The malware scores are high (mostly 0.9 or 1), which is justified given the behavior.\n- The obfuscation scores are also high, reflecting the intentional concealment.\n- The risk scores align with the potential for system compromise.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores across reports are consistent with the observed behavior.\n- No adjustments needed; the analysis correctly identifies malicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Final Summary:\n**Estimated malware score:** **0.9** (consistent with high malicious intent).  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** **0.9** (due to obfuscation and dynamic code execution).  \n**Estimated overall risk score:** **0.9** (high risk, potential malware).\n\nThis package should be flagged for removal or further investigation before any use.",
