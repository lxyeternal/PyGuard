{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up a Python package with a custom install command that executes embedded obfuscated code during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the 'README.md' file for the long description and uses an embedded base64-encoded string within the custom install class.",
  "sinks": "The embedded base64-decoded code is executed with 'exec()', which can run arbitrary code; this is the primary sink where malicious activity could occur.",
  "flows": "The code decodes a base64 string and executes it during the installation process, which is triggered by running the setup script. The flow is: package installation -> custom install class -> code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of base64-encoded code executed via 'exec()' during installation; obfuscated code with no clear purpose; variable names are nonsensical and suggest obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools and defines a setup configuration for a package. A custom install class overrides the 'fhIxphFMfcrShfkCVFsobVrHxrWhQtTX' method, which attempts to decode and execute a base64-encoded string. This string, when decoded, appears to import modules and execute code that could be malicious or unwanted, including potentially harmful commands or data exfiltration routines. The use of 'exec()' on decoded data during installation is a significant red flag. The rest of the setup code appears normal, but the critical concern is the embedded obfuscated code that runs at install time.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious component: execution of obfuscated base64-decoded code during installation, which is a common technique for malicious payloads or backdoors. Given the obfuscation, execution context, and potential for malicious activity, this package is likely malicious or at least risky. It should be rejected or further analyzed in a secure environment.",
