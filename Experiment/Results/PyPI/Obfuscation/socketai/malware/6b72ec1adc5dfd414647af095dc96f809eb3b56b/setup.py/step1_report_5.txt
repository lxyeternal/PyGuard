{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be a setup configuration for a Python package, intended for distribution via PyPI. It includes a custom installation class that executes embedded code during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads embedded base64-encoded data within the 'exec' call inside the custom install class, and reads the README.md file for the long description.",
  "sinks": "The base64-decoded data executes Python code that imports modules, manipulates files, and potentially runs arbitrary code during package installation.",
  "flows": "Input from the embedded base64 string flows into the exec() call, which executes potentially malicious code during the installation process.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a hardcoded base64-encoded string decoded and executed at runtime, which is an unusual and suspicious pattern. The presence of an intentionally obfuscated exec() call indicates malicious intent, possibly to run hidden malicious code during install. The use of dynamic code execution during package setup is highly suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools and defines a custom install class that overrides the 'run' method (misspelled as 'fhIxphFMfcrShfkCVFsobVrHxrWhQtTX'), executing a base64-encoded payload via exec(). This payload, once decoded, imports 'os' and 'subprocess' modules, and runs a complex series of commands that appear designed to download and execute additional code from a remote source or perform malicious actions. The base64 string is intentionally obscured, indicating malicious obfuscation. The package setup defines basic metadata but relies on the obfuscated payload to run malicious code during installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, containing obfuscated payload that executes during package installation, potentially to compromise systems or perform malicious activities. The use of encoded, dynamically executed code is a strong indicator of malicious behavior.",
