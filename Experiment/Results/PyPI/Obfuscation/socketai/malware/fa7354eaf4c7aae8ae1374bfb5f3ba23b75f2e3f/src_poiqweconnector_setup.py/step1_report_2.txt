{
  "purpose": "The code customizes the setup process for a Python package, adding additional behavior during development and installation phases.",
  "sources": "Requests to external URLs within overridden methods of custom install and develop commands.",
  "sinks": "External HTTP GET requests to potentially malicious domains during install and develop commands.",
  "flows": "During 'develop' or 'install', the code makes HTTP GET requests to 'http://poiqwe.info/install_post_dev', 'http://poiqwe.info/install_post', 'http://poiqwe.info/install_pre_dev', and 'http://poiqwe.info/install_pre'.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual class and method naming with obfuscated-looking identifiers; HTTP requests made in custom setup commands; no apparent legitimate purpose for these network calls in typical setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup-related modules and subclasses them to override 'develop' and 'install' commands. In these overridden methods, it performs HTTP GET requests to suspicious domains ('poiqwe.info') during setup, which is highly unusual and potentially malicious. These requests occur during standard installation/development processes, possibly to communicate with a remote server for malicious intent, such as reporting, tracking, or executing further malicious actions. The code does not perform any other meaningful setup logic. The package dependencies are listed but appear benign. The code’s obfuscated class and method names suggest an attempt to hide malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code injects network communication into the package installation process, connecting to suspicious domains during setup. This behavior is typical of malicious setup scripts used for remote command and control, data exfiltration, or tracking. Given the network activity during setup and obfuscated naming, this code is likely malicious or at least suspicious, warranting caution.",
