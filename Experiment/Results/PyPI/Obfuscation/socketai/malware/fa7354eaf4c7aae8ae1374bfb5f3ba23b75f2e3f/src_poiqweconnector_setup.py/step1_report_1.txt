{
  "purpose": "The code customizes setup commands for a Python package, executing HTTP GET requests during development and installation phases.",
  "sources": "The code reads external URLs via requests.get() inside custom command classes during 'develop' and 'install' phases.",
  "sinks": "The untrusted URLs accessed could be used for data exfiltration, command and control, or triggering malicious server-side actions.",
  "flows": "During 'develop' and 'install' commands, requests.get() is called to external URLs before proceeding with standard setup steps.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes making HTTP requests to suspicious domains ('poiqwe.info') during package setup, which is atypical and suspicious. The class and method names are obfuscated and intentionally obscure.",
  "analysis": "The script redefines the 'develop' and 'install' commands from setuptools to insert requests.get() calls to potentially malicious domains during package setup. The URLs appear suspicious and are not related to common package functionality. The obfuscation of class and method names suggests an attempt to conceal behavior. No other malicious actions or code injection are present, but the side-effect of contacting external, untrusted servers during setup indicates malicious intent or at least malicious behavior. The code could be used to perform malicious activities such as data exfiltration or remote command execution depending on the server's response.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains malicious behavior through the inclusion of HTTP requests to suspicious external domains during setup phases. The obfuscation and the malicious purpose of contacting external servers during installation are strong indicators of malicious intent.",
