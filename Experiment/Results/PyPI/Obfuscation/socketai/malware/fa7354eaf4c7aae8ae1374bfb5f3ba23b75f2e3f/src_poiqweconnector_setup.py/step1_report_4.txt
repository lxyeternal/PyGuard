{
  "purpose": "The code customizes setup commands to perform HTTP GET requests to specific URLs during development and installation phases, likely to trigger external actions.",
  "sources": "The requests.get() calls within the overridden develop and install methods in the custom command classes.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leakage or remote command execution via HTTP requests to external domains (poiqwe.info).",
  "flows": "When the 'develop' or 'install' commands are run, the code makes GET requests to the specified URLs, which could be used for command-and-control or tracking.",
  "anomalies": "The use of obfuscated class and method names, and the inclusion of requests to suspicious URLs during setup phases indicate unusual activity. The code does not process user input but triggers network requests at install time.",
  "analysis": "The code redefines setup commands 'develop' and 'install' with custom classes that perform HTTP GET requests to external domains. These requests are made during package installation or development setup, which could be malicious if used to load malicious scripts, exfiltrate data, or trigger unwanted actions. The URLs are suspicious and suggest potential backdoor or tracking mechanisms. No other malicious or obfuscated code is present, but the network calls at setup are unusual and potentially dangerous. The code’s primary purpose appears to be to contact external servers during setup, which is a common tactic in malicious supply chain attacks.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior by executing network requests during package setup, potentially for malicious purposes such as command-and-control, tracking, or delivering payloads. The obfuscated class names and targeted URLs raise significant concerns about malicious intent.",
