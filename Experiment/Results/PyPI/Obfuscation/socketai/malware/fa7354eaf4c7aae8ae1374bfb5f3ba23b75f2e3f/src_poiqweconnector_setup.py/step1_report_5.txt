{
  "purpose": "The code is configuring the setup process for a Python package, including custom install and develop commands that make HTTP GET requests to external URLs during installation or development setup.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external inputs directly; however, it initiates HTTP requests to external URLs during specific setup commands.",
  "sinks": "The external HTTP GET requests to 'http://poiqwe.info/install_post_dev', 'http://poiqwe.info/install_post', 'http://poiqwe.info/install_pre_dev', and 'http://poiqwe.info/install_pre' could lead to data exfiltration or remote code execution if the server responds maliciously or if the requests are misused.",
  "flows": "During execution of 'develop' or 'install' commands, the code makes GET requests to the specified URLs, which could trigger malicious actions or download malicious content if the URLs are compromised.",
  "anomalies": "The code makes unsolicited HTTP GET requests to suspicious external domains during setup commands. Variable and class names are obfuscated and nonsensical, suggesting intentional concealment. No user input is read, but the requests are made unconditionally during setup phases.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom classes inheriting from 'develop' and 'install' commands from setuptools. Each class overrides the method that runs during setup and executes a GET request to a suspicious domain. These actions occur automatically during package installation or development setup, which is unusual and potentially malicious. The URLs are non-standard and suggest malicious intent, possibly for tracking, command and control, or malicious payload delivery. The code does not process user input or environment variables, but the unsolicited network calls are a serious concern. Variable and class names are deliberately obfuscated, which may indicate an attempt to hide malicious behavior. Overall, the code’s behavior during setup is suspicious and potentially harmful.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by making automated, unsolicited HTTP requests to suspicious external URLs during package setup and development commands. This could be used for tracking, exfiltration, or executing malicious payloads. The obfuscated naming further indicates malicious intent. Overall, this package should be considered dangerous and not used.",
