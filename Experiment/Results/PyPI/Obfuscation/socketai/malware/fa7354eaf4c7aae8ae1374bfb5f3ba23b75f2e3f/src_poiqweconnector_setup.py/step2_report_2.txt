  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the issues, and assess the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports identify the same core behavior: custom setup commands that execute `requests.get()` calls to suspicious external URLs (`poiqwe.info`) during `develop` and `install` phases.\n- The class and method names are obfuscated, which is suspicious.\n- The URLs are not related to typical package functionality.\n- The network requests occur during setup, which is unusual and potentially malicious.\n- The high confidence scores (around 0.8-0.9) reflect the suspicion that this is malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 1: Presence of malicious behavior in code**\n\n**Confirmed?**  \nYes. The code clearly makes HTTP GET requests to external, suspicious URLs during setup commands, which is abnormal and indicative of malicious intent.\n\n**Note:**  \nNo other malicious actions like code injection or payload execution are present, but the side-effects (contacting external servers) are enough to classify this as malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 2: Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning**\n\n**Potential flaws:**  \n- The reports assume malicious intent based on URL suspicion and obfuscation, which is reasonable but should be noted that the code itself doesn't show payload delivery or data exfiltration directly.  \n- They interpret the network requests as malicious, which is justified given the context, but without server responses or payload analysis, absolute certainty isn't possible.  \n- The reports don't mention verifying the content of the requests or the server responses, which could clarify maliciousness further.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reasoning is sound given the context; the suspicion is justified. No significant logical flaws are evident.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 3: Score assessments**\n\n**Scores given:**  \n- Malware: 0.7-0.9  \n- Obfuscated: 0.8  \n- Security risk: 0.8-0.9\n\n**Are these reasonable?**  \nYes. Given the behavior, high scores are justified.\n\n**Suggestions:**  \n- For the malware score, since no payload or code execution is shown, but the contact with suspicious servers is a strong indicator, a score of 0.8-0.9 is appropriate.  \n- For obfuscation, 0.8 is reasonable due to obfuscated class/method names.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 4: Justification for high risk scores (>0.5)**\n\n**Yes, scores >0.5 are justified.**  \n- Contacting external servers during setup can be used for command-and-control, data exfiltration, or tracking, which are serious security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 5: Malware score reflection**\n\n**Does the malware score reflect malicious activity?**  \n- Yes. The high malware scores (around 0.8) are justified by the suspicious network activity, obfuscation, and timing during setup.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 6: Claims based on assumptions**\n\n- The reports assume malicious intent due to URL suspicion and obfuscation.  \n- While these are strong indicators, without analyzing server responses or payloads, absolute certainty isn't possible.  \n- However, in supply chain security, such contact during setup is highly suspicious and often malicious.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe assumption is reasonable and justified given the context.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 7: Consistency of scores with the report**\n\n- The scores are consistent with the described behavior: high suspicion, obfuscation, and malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n| Score Type      | Estimated Score | Justification                                                      |\n|-----------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | **0.85**          | Contact with suspicious domains during setup, obfuscation, high confidence. No payload observed, but behavior is highly suspicious. |\n| Obfuscated      | **0.8**           | Class and method names are intentionally obscure, indicating concealment. |\n| Risk            | **0.9**           | Contacting external, untrusted servers during setup is a serious security risk, potentially leading to data exfiltration, remote control, or malicious payload delivery. |\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports correctly identify malicious behavior. The high scores are justified and consistent with the observed code. No significant adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nThis package should be flagged as malicious, and distribution should be halted until further analysis confirms whether the external servers deliver malicious payloads or are used for command-and-control.",
