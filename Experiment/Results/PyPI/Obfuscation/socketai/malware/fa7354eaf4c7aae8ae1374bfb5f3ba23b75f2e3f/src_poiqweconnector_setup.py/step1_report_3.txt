{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up a Python package with custom build commands.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the network via requests.get calls within overridden develop and install command classes.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to external URLs (http://poiqwe.info/install_post_dev, http://poiqwe.info/install_post, http://poiqwe.info/install_pre_dev, http://poiqwe.info/install_pre).",
  "flows": "During package installation or development setup, the code triggers HTTP GET requests to external domains, potentially sending system information or executing malicious commands remotely.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual naming conventions for classes and methods; code injects network calls directly into setup command hooks, which is suspicious. The URLs are obfuscated and suspicious, indicating potential malicious intent. The package metadata includes empty or unusual entries.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup tools and subprocess modules but overrides build commands to include HTTP requests to external domains. These requests occur during the 'develop' and 'install' processes, which are typical points where malicious code can be injected to exfiltrate data or execute malicious payloads. The class and method names are obfuscated, which is often a sign of malicious intent. The URLs used in requests are suspicious and likely malicious. No other benign functionality is evident; the rest of the setup code is standard, but the network calls are abnormal in this context. The URLs could be used to control or monitor the installation process remotely, indicating a potential backdoor or malicious command-and-control activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates malicious behavior by executing network requests to suspicious external URLs during package installation and development. This indicates an attempt at remote command-and-control or data exfiltration, which constitutes a security risk. The obfuscation and timing of these requests strongly suggest malicious intent.",
