  "purpose": "Detect and evaluate potential malicious behavior in the provided Python setup code, focusing on network activity, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Requests to 'http://poiqwe.info/install_post_dev', 'http://poiqwe.info/install_post', 'http://poiqwe.info/install_pre_dev', and 'http://poiqwe.info/install_pre' during custom 'develop' and 'install' commands.",
  "sinks": "External URL requests during setup, which could lead to data exfiltration, remote command execution, or payload delivery.",
  "flows": "Code execution during setup commands triggers requests to suspicious domains, indicating a source-to-sink flow of malicious intent.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names; network requests to suspicious domains during package installation; repeated pattern across multiple classes and functions.",
  "analysis": "The code redefines 'develop' and 'install' commands with custom classes that perform HTTP GET requests to suspicious URLs during setup phases. The obfuscated naming suggests an attempt to conceal malicious intent. The network activity during installation is abnormal and indicative of potential data exfiltration, remote control, or payload delivery. The high suspicion is supported by consistent patterns across multiple classes and functions, with high confidence scores assigned in the reports. The behavior aligns with known supply chain attack tactics, making the malicious intent highly probable. The scores of malware (0.8-0.9), obfuscation (0.8), and security risk (0.8-0.9) are justified based on the evidence.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior through network requests to suspicious domains during setup, combined with obfuscation. The high scores assigned are appropriate and reflect the severity of the threat. This package should be flagged as malicious, and usage should be avoided.",
