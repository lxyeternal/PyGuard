  "conclusion": "The code functions as a malicious backdoor, establishing a covert reverse shell via DNS-based C2, with additional beaconing behavior. It employs obfuscation and dynamic configuration techniques, making it a high-severity security threat. The malware score is set to 1, the security risk score to 1, and the obfuscation score to 0.4, reflecting moderate obfuscation. These scores are consistent with the observed behavior and threat level."
