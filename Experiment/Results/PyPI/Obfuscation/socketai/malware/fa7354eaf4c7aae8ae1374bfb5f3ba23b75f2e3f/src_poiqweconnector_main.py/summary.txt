  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, implementing a covert reverse shell controlled via DNS, with additional HTTP-based command or exfiltration channels. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=1, securityRisk=1, obfuscated=0.8) are justified and consistent with the behavior. No adjustments are necessary."
