      "confidence": 0.95,
      "conclusion": "The code functions as a malicious backdoor, establishing a covert reverse shell via DNS-based C2, with additional beaconing behavior. It employs obfuscation and dynamic configuration techniques, making it a high-severity security threat. The malware score is set to 1, the security risk score to 1, and the obfuscation score to 0.4, reflecting moderate obfuscation. These scores are consistent with the observed behavior and threat level."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior through network requests to suspicious domains during setup, combined with obfuscation. The high scores assigned are appropriate and reflect the severity of the threat. This package should be flagged as malicious, and usage should be avoided."

The scores assigned in the reports (malware=1, securityRisk=1, obfuscated=0.8) are justified and consistent with the behavior. No adjustments are necessary."
