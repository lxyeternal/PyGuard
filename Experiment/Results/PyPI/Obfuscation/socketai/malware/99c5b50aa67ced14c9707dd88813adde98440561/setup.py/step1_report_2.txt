  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package with additional code that executes conditional system commands and potentially downloads or manipulates files.",
  "sources": "sys.platform, subprocess.check_output, hardcoded base64 strings decoded at runtime, file reads from 'LICENSE' and 'NOTICE', environment variables indirectly via subprocess, and possibly file system modifications.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.check_output, subprocess.Popen, file write/read operations, os.makedirs, os.chmod, os.system commands.",
  "flows": "Platform check → conditional execution → decoding base64 strings → executing system commands → reading files → writing files → starting processes.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class name and method, base64 decoding, runtime string manipulations, indirect file operations in '/tmp/', writing and executing a file ('gomod') extracted from a PDF file, no explicit URL or network activity, but potential for executing downloaded or embedded code.",
  "analysis": "The script contains a custom installation class that, on macOS, decodes base64-encoded commands and executes them via subprocess. It further reads a PDF file ('simple_linear_regression.pdf'), extracts part of it, writes it to a temporary directory, sets permissions, and runs it as a process. The presence of base64 decoding, obfuscated identifiers, and runtime file manipulation suggests an attempt to hide malicious activity. The code could be downloading, executing, or installing payloads silently during setup, possibly for persistence or lateral movement. No network activity is explicitly observed in this snippet, but the obfuscated code could facilitate that. Overall, it appears designed to execute embedded or external code stealthily during installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits obfuscation and performs suspicious activities such as decoding hidden commands, manipulating files in temporary directories, and executing potentially malicious payloads without explicit user consent. This indicates a high likelihood of malicious intent during the package installation process.",
