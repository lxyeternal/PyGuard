{
  "purpose": "The code is primarily for setting up a Python package with a custom installation step, including conditional post-install actions on macOS.",
  "sources": "Reads from environment variables, system commands, and a local PDF file.",
  "sinks": "Executes system commands, writes to files, and runs a subprocess without wait (Popen).",
  "flows": "From decoding base64 strings, executing system commands, reading files, and writing files; culminates in executing a PDF file as a process.",
  "anomalies": "Contains obfuscated variable and method names; decodes base64-encoded commands that execute system commands conditionally on macOS; reads a local PDF file and writes a segment of its bytes to a new file, then executes that file. The base64 decoded command appears to invoke 'ioreg -k IOPclassUUID', which is a system info command. The code writes a PDF file and executes it as a process, which is unusual. The use of subprocess.Popen without wait and suppression of output could hide malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, on macOS, decodes a base64-encoded command ('ioreg -k IOPclassUUID'), runs it, and processes its output to find specific UUIDs. If these match certain hardcoded UUIDs, it reads a local PDF ('simple_linear_regression.pdf'), extracts part of its bytes, writes it into a 'gomod' file in a temporary directory, changes its permissions, and executes it. The direct execution of a PDF file as a process is suspicious, especially as it is done without user consent or clear purpose. The obfuscated variable and method names suggest an attempt to conceal behavior. The code does not communicate over the network or collect data directly but executing files and system info commands could be used for malicious purposes, especially if the PDF or the system command has malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs obfuscated actions that involve executing system commands and a PDF file in a manner that is suspicious and potentially malicious, especially given the execution of a PDF as a process. Its intent appears to be concealed, and it manipulates files and system info on macOS. The behavior suggests malicious intent or at least malicious potential.",
