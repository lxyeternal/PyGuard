  "conclusion": "The script exhibits high suspicion of malicious intent, acting as a covert backdoor or payload delivery mechanism targeting macOS systems. Its obfuscation, payload extraction, and execution patterns are characteristic of supply chain malware or malicious installers. The overall security risk is high, and the package should be considered potentially malicious until further analysis confirms benignity."
