{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script that performs obfuscated decoding of strings, platform-specific actions on macOS, and executes embedded payloads extracted from a PDF file, potentially as a backdoor or malicious payload delivery mechanism.",
  "sources": "Decoding base64 strings, reading 'simple_linear_regression.pdf', extracting data from it, and reading system UUIDs for conditional logic.",
  "sinks": "Executing subprocess commands, writing files to /tmp/, setting permissions, and executing the extracted payload ('gomod') as a process.",
  "flows": "Decodes base64 strings -> conditional on platform -> executes commands via subprocess -> reads and extracts data from PDF -> writes payload to file -> sets permissions -> executes payload -> continues installation process.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class/method names, base64 decoding, conditional platform-specific code, executing a PDF as a binary, writing files in /tmp/ with hidden or extracted content, suppressing output during execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is heavily obfuscated, decoding strings and executing payloads only on macOS. It reads a PDF, extracts a segment, writes it as an executable ('gomod'), sets permissions, and runs it, which is suspicious because PDFs are not typically executable. The use of base64 encoding, hidden method names, and conditional logic suggests an attempt to conceal malicious activity. The pattern of extracting and executing embedded data indicates a potential backdoor or covert payload delivery. The code's behavior aligns with known malware tactics such as covert execution, environment detection, and payload obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The script exhibits high suspicion of malicious intent, acting as a covert backdoor or payload delivery mechanism targeting macOS systems. Its obfuscation, payload extraction, and execution patterns are characteristic of supply chain malware or malicious installers. The overall security risk is high, and the package should be considered potentially malicious until further analysis confirms benignity.",
