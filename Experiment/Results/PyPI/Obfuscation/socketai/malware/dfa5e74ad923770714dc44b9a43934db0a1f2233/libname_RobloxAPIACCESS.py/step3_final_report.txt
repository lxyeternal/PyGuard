{
  "purpose": "The code is designed for malicious data collection, including system info, browser credentials, tokens, and screenshots, which are then exfiltrated via a Discord webhook. It decrypts stored passwords and tokens, captures system data, and deletes local evidence, indicating stealthy credential theft and system profiling.",
  "sources": "System info (psutil), environment variables, browser data directories, stored password databases, geolocation APIs, and token files.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent to a Discord webhook via HTTP POST requests; local files (passwords.txt, passwords.zip) are created and then deleted; decrypted credentials and tokens are stored in memory and files.",
  "flows": "Sources such as system info, browser data, and tokens feed into decryption routines and data collection functions, which then transmit data to the webhook and store/deletes local copies for stealth.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with random variable and function names, multiple try-except blocks hiding errors, use of Windows cryptography APIs for decrypting stored credentials, and deletion of evidence files post-exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code performs extensive malicious activities: collecting system info, decrypting stored browser passwords and tokens, capturing screenshots, zipping and deleting local data, and exfiltrating everything via a Discord webhook. Obfuscation and error suppression tactics are used to hide malicious intent. Despite some syntax issues and undefined variables in the snippet, the core behavior aligns with malware designed for credential theft, system profiling, and stealthy exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly malicious, performing credential theft, system info harvesting, and covert data exfiltration. Its obfuscation and behavior justify maximum malware and risk scores. It should be treated as malware with high confidence and immediate action recommended.",
