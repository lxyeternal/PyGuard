  "conclusion": "This import statement alone does not indicate malicious activity or obfuscation. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified. The minimal risk score reflects potential concerns if the imported object is used maliciously later, but no evidence supports this from the snippet provided. Vigilance should be maintained when analyzing the full codebase, especially how 'robloxmessage' is used."
