  "purpose": "Importing the 'robloxmessage' function or object from the 'RobloxAPIACCESS' module, likely for interacting with Roblox's API.",
  "sources": "The import statement indicates source is the 'RobloxAPIACCESS' package/module.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis possible with a single import statement; no execution or data manipulation shown.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior in the import statement alone; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement from a third-party module named 'RobloxAPIACCESS'. There is no evidence of data processing, input reading, or malicious activity within this snippet. As only an import is shown, it is impossible to determine any malicious intent or malicious behavior solely from this line.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a simple import statement with no apparent malicious behavior. The security risk is minimal based on this fragment. Further code is needed to assess actual behavior.",
