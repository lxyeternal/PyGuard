  "purpose": "Import the 'robloxmessage' function or class from the 'RobloxAPIACCESS' module, likely intended for interaction with Roblox's API.",
  "sources": "Import statement sourcing 'robloxmessage' from 'RobloxAPIACCESS' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows evident from the single import statement alone.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow can be determined from this single line.",
  "anomalies": "The code only contains an import statement; no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement. It does not execute any functions, process untrusted data, or perform network activities. Without additional context or code, it is not possible to detect malicious intent or suspicious activity. The module name 'RobloxAPIACCESS' suggests interaction with Roblox's API, but this alone is not malicious. No evidence of malware, data leaks, or backdoors is present in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there is no indication of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign; however, full assessment requires additional context or code.",
