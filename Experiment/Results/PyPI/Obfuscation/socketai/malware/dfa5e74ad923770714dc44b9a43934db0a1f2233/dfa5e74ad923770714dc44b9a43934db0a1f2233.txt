      "conclusion": "The code is a benign package setup script with superficial obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware is 0, obfuscation is low (~0.2), and overall security risk is minimal (~0.1)."

      "conclusion": "This import statement alone does not indicate malicious activity or obfuscation. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified. The minimal risk score reflects potential concerns if the imported object is used maliciously later, but no evidence supports this from the snippet provided. Vigilance should be maintained when analyzing the full codebase, especially how 'robloxmessage' is used."

      "conclusion": "This code is highly malicious, performing credential theft, system info harvesting, and covert data exfiltration. Its obfuscation and behavior justify maximum malware and risk scores. It should be treated as malware with high confidence and immediate action recommended."
