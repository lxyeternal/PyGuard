{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for a Python package, defining metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings for package name, version, description, and dependencies; no external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; the code does not perform network, file, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "The setup() function uses the provided static metadata; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names and a non-descriptive, seemingly random package name; no malicious code or network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names, which is unusual but not malicious. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are present. The obfuscation and package naming are suspicious but do not constitute malicious intent. The malware score is 0, security risk is low (~0.2), and obfuscation is moderate (~0.7). The confidence in benignity is high (0.9).",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, functioning as a typical setup script with obfuscated variable names and a suspicious package name. No malicious activity is detected, but obfuscation warrants cautious monitoring. The scores are consistent with the analysis.",
