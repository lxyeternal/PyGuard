  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically, considering the evidence, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** Standard setup script, uses obfuscated variable names but no malicious code, no network or data leaks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0.3, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. Obfuscation alone does not imply malicious intent, and the code is typical for a setup script.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with obfuscated variable names, no malicious behavior, standard setup.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0.8, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The high obfuscation score (0.8) is justified given the variable naming. No evidence of malware.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores seem appropriate. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** Obfuscated variable names, suspicious package name, but no malicious actions observed.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, obfuscated=0.7, confidence=0.8.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher security risk score (0.2) due to obfuscation and suspicious package name is reasonable. No malware detected.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** Obfuscated variable names, unused variables, suspicious package name, but no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, obfuscated=0.7, confidence=0.6.\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous, obfuscation and unusual naming justify the scores. No malware.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate. No adjustments.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** Obfuscated variable names, minimal metadata, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0.3, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The low malware and security risk scores align with the findings. Obfuscation is mild.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Ranges from 0.3 to 0.8, justified by variable naming.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly higher where obfuscation and suspicious package names are noted, but still low overall.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0 — no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.4 — moderate obfuscation present but not suspicious enough to warrant higher.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — low, mainly due to obfuscation and package naming conventions.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent, and their scores are justified. The code appears benign, with obfuscation being the primary concern but not indicative of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of Recommendations:**\n\n- No significant changes to the scores are necessary.\n- Maintain a cautious stance due to obfuscation, but based on the evidence, the package is likely safe.\n\n**Final notes:** Always monitor for future updates or code changes that might introduce malicious behavior.",
