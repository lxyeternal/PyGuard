  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'eaz7qo67p5gz723l' with version 1.0.0, specifying dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__)), setup() function arguments, hardcoded strings",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data processing, network, or external output functions",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; variables are assigned but not used in a malicious context",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names (e.g., RJNIhkdIZdzhoFbtTtjyZUBgGukdQiKF), lack of descriptive variable naming, unusual naming patterns; no active code execution or dynamic code manipulation observed",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports setuptools and os modules, then defines variables with obfuscated names holding static strings and file paths. It proceeds to call setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. All data appears static, with no evident malicious operations such as network activity, credential handling, or code execution. The obfuscated variable names might suggest attempts at concealment, but the content itself does not perform malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard Python package setup script with obfuscated variable names but no malicious behavior detected. There are no signs of malware, data leakage, or security risks within this code snippet.",
