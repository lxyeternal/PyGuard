  "purpose": "Download and execute a remote executable file from a specified URL.",
  "sources": "requests.get(url).content retrieves data from the specified URL; open('download.exe', 'wb') writes data to disk.",
  "sinks": "os.startfile() executes the downloaded file on the local system.",
  "flows": "requests.get() retrieves remote file -> write() saves it locally -> os.startfile() executes the file.",
  "anomalies": "The code downloads an executable from a URL on Discord's CDN and immediately runs it without verification or user consent, which is suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports requests and os modules. It defines a function that downloads an executable from a Discord CDN link. The file is saved as 'download.exe' and then immediately executed using os.startfile. This behavior suggests the code is designed to fetch and run potentially arbitrary code without user knowledge, a common tactic in malware distribution. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are present. The URL is hardcoded and points to a potentially malicious executable. The code lacks any verification or validation steps, increasing risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and potentially malicious, as it downloads and executes an external executable without validation or user interaction. It resembles typical malware behavior designed to deliver and run malicious payloads.",
