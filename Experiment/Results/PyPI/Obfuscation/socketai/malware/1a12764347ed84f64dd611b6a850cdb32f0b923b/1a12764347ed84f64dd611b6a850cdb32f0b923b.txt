      "conclusion": "The code is a benign proxy configuration utility with obfuscated identifiers. No signs of malware or malicious activity are present. The obfuscation likely serves proprietary or concealment purposes. The overall security risk is low, primarily related to potential misconfiguration, not malicious intent."

      "obfuscated": 0.75,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a complex, obfuscated proxy configuration and chaining utility that does not exhibit active malicious behavior but could be exploited for covert purposes due to its obfuscation and proxy handling capabilities. The current low malware and moderate security risk scores are justified; slight adjustments to malware (~0.2-0.3) and risk (~0.5) could better reflect the potential misuse without implying active malicious activity."

      "obfuscated": 0.8,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is primarily designed for proxy management and does not contain explicit malicious behavior. The high obfuscation level is suspicious but not definitive of malicious intent. The security risk is moderate due to potential misuse if proxies are malicious, but no direct evidence of malware or sabotage is present. Scores are consistent with this assessment."
