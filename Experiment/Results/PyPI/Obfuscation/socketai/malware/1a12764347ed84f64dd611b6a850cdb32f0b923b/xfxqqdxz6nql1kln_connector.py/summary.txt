  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a complex, obfuscated proxy configuration and chaining utility that does not exhibit active malicious behavior but could be exploited for covert purposes due to its obfuscation and proxy handling capabilities. The current low malware and moderate security risk scores are justified; slight adjustments to malware (~0.2-0.3) and risk (~0.5) could better reflect the potential misuse without implying active malicious activity."
