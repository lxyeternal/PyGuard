  "conclusion": "The code is primarily designed for proxy management and does not contain explicit malicious behavior. The high obfuscation level is suspicious but not definitive of malicious intent. The security risk is moderate due to potential misuse if proxies are malicious, but no direct evidence of malware or sabotage is present. Scores are consistent with this assessment."
