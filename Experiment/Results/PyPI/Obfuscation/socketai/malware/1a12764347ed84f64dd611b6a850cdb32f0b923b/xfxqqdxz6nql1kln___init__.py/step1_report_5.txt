{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a Python package that provides SOCKS proxy support for network connections, including importing relevant modules and defining exports.",
  "sources": "Imports from external libraries (python_socks), internal modules (_connector, _utils, _deprecated), and hardcoded string assignments for package name and version.",
  "sinks": "Exported symbols such as '__title__', '__version__', and classes/functions related to proxies, which may be used downstream; no direct sinks related to network, file, or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Import statements load external and internal modules; string assignments set package metadata; exported symbols are exposed for external use. No untrusted data flow or external network activity observed within this code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names (e.g., ODkUCdoUoIcADrIkISVWEADGBwRmztOg), which could suggest obfuscation or concealment. No visible hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious logic. The code is minimal and primarily imports and exports.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles imports and defines what symbols are publicly accessible. The use of obfuscated variable names is unusual but not inherently malicious; it could be an attempt at hiding intent or simply an obfuscation technique. There are no network operations, data leaks, code injections, or suspicious behaviors in this snippet. The structure aligns with typical package module setup. No indicators of malware or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard module setup for a proxy support package, with some obfuscated variable names that are not malicious by themselves. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or malware in this fragment.",
