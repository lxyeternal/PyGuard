{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module setup for a proxy handling library, importing necessary components and defining the public API via __all__.",
  "sources": "Import statements from external libraries ('python_socks', 'aiohttp-socks') and internal modules ('connector', 'utils', 'deprecated'). No data input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks are evident in this snippet; no network connections, data processing, or output operations are shown.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources; the code only imports and exports symbols without processing data.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names such as 'ODkUCdoUoIcADrIkISVWEADGBwRmztOg' and similar are present, which are suspicious but not inherently malicious. No executable logic or network activity is included.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, variable assignments with obfuscated names, and an __all__ declaration, indicating a module interface setup. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not demonstrate malicious intent. No data sources, sinks, or flows involving untrusted data are present. The absence of network activity or data processing suggests this is a benign module, possibly obfuscated for code concealment or anti-reverse engineering. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0, low security risk) are consistent with this assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet shows no evidence of malicious behavior or active security risks. The obfuscation is suspicious but not indicative of malware. The module appears to be a standard part of a proxy library with obfuscated variable names, and the overall security risk is minimal.",
