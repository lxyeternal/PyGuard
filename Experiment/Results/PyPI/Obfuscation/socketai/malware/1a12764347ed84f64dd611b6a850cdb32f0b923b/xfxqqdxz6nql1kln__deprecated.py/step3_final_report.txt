{
  "purpose": "Proxy configuration utility managing SOCKS proxies with obfuscated class and method names, issuing deprecation warnings.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'python_socks', local connector class, class constructor parameters, class method invoking superclass method.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks indicating data leaks or malicious network activity; exception classes assigned to variables are benign.",
  "flows": "Initialization flows through constructor and class method, configuring proxy type and issuing warnings; no malicious data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names, deprecated warning for 'SocksConnector', exception classes assigned to variables, which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is an obfuscated wrapper around proxy handling, with no evidence of malicious behavior such as network exfiltration, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors. The obfuscation appears to serve concealment rather than malicious intent. Deprecated warnings indicate outdated code but do not imply malicious activity. Exception class assignments are unconventional but benign. Overall, the code is a configuration utility with low security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign proxy configuration utility with obfuscated identifiers. No signs of malware or malicious activity are present. The obfuscation likely serves proprietary or concealment purposes. The overall security risk is low, primarily related to potential misconfiguration, not malicious intent.",
