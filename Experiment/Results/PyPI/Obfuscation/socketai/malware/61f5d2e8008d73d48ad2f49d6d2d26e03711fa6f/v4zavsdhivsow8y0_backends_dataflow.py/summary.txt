  "security_risk": 0.9,

  "conclusion": "The code exhibits strong indicators of malicious behavior, including obfuscation, dynamic payload handling, and stealthy file writing. The scores assigned are justified and reflect a high security risk. It should be treated as malicious until further payload analysis confirms otherwise."
