      "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscation. No active malicious behavior is detected. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not confirm malicious intent. Scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware score remains at 0, obfuscation is high (~0.75), and overall security risk is low (~0.2). Further review of the full package source is recommended if concerns persist."

There is no evidence of malware or security vulnerabilities in this snippet. The obfuscation suggests caution, but the overall security risk remains low. Further review should focus on concrete implementations extending these interfaces."

      "conclusion": "While no direct evidence of malware or malicious activity is present, the heavy obfuscation, dynamic import, and URL handling features pose potential security concerns. The code should be further reviewed with runtime analysis and validation of external modules before deployment. The malware score is set at 0.2, consistent with the absence of explicit malicious actions but acknowledging the potential for concealment."
