  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is to perform some form of data processing or utility function, though the specific intent is unclear without more context.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables, user input via function parameters, and potentially external files or network requests if present.",
  "sinks": "Data may be written to the console, files, or sent over network connections, or stored in environment variables or databases.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or user input through processing functions to sinks like output statements, file writes, or network transmissions.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains potential anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated parts. No explicit obfuscation is identified, but unusual language features or unnecessary complexity are noted.",
  "analysis": "The code does not include obvious malicious payloads such as system command executions, network calls to suspicious domains, or data exfiltration. It uses standard libraries and patterns. There are no signs of backdoors, hidden commands, or cryptomining activity. However, the presence of reading environment variables and potential network access points warrants caution. No explicit hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are found, but incomplete code snippets or hidden logic cannot be ruled out. The overall structure appears benign, but the lack of complete context limits certainty.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no clear indicators of malicious behavior or malware. The code seems to serve a legitimate purpose, with no evidence of malicious intent. However, due to potential incomplete or obfuscated sections, a low confidence is assigned. No high-risk security issues are detected.",
