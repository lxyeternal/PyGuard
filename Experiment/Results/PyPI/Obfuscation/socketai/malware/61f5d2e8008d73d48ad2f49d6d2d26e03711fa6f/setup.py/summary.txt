  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscation. No active malicious behavior is detected. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not confirm malicious intent. Scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware score remains at 0, obfuscation is high (~0.75), and overall security risk is low (~0.2). Further review of the full package source is recommended if concerns persist."
