{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package, performing package metadata configuration, reading version info from __init__.py, and gathering package data.",
  "sources": "Reads __init__.py files within packages, reads README.md, and traverses directories with os.walk to collect package data.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only reads local files and sets up package metadata without external data transmission or execution.",
  "flows": "Reads package files to extract version info and package data; no data flows to external systems or network.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function and variable names, use of 'os.oiKmaVosfaRSmqjyGPUCwFiHkFKYkXyv' instead of 'os.path', which appears malformed or intentionally obfuscated.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup tasks but employs obfuscation in naming, raising suspicion. The malformed attribute suggests possible concealment. No malicious code, network activity, or data exfiltration is detected. The obfuscation could be an attempt to hide malicious intent, but evidence is lacking. The code's behavior is consistent with a benign setup script, albeit with suspicious naming.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscation. No active malicious behavior is detected. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not confirm malicious intent. Scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware score remains at 0, obfuscation is high (~0.75), and overall security risk is low (~0.2). Further review of the full package source is recommended if concerns persist.",
