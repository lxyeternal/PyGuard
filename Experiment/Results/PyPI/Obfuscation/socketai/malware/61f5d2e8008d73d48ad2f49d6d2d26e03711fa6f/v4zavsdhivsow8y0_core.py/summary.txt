  "confidence": 0.75,
  "conclusion": "While no direct evidence of malware or malicious activity is present, the heavy obfuscation, dynamic import, and URL handling features pose potential security concerns. The code should be further reviewed with runtime analysis and validation of external modules before deployment. The malware score is set at 0.2, consistent with the absence of explicit malicious actions but acknowledging the potential for concealment."
