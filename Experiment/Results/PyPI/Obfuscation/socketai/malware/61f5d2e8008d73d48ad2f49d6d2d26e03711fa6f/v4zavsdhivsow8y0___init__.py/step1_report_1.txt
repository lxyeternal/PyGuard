    "Imported identifiers from 'quantiumbase.core' are named with seemingly random, nonsensical strings ('GrwbbDSXUFtilmaupQllxXHoiUirsQLZ', 'MXXalnSfQVGOphXJhvGKgKyhrDOQBaho'), which could be an obfuscation attempt or malicious renaming.",
    "The code contains no functions, data processing, or control flow; it only imports and defines a string variable.",
    "The variable 'NDMyGDcMftWnnMXgCBpRsvmwapWkxria' is assigned a version string '0.8.1', which appears normal, but the variable name is nonsensical and obfuscated."
  ],
  "analysis": "The code imports two components: one from 'quantiumbase.core' with obfuscated, nonsensical names, and one local import 'dataflow'. The imported names are not descriptive, which is often a red flag for obfuscation or malicious intent. There are no data flows, no input processing, and no sensitive operations in this snippet. The only assignment is to a version string variable with an obfuscated name. This could be a tactic to hide malicious code or avoid detection, but on its own, the code does not perform any malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is minimal and contains obfuscated import identifiers and a version string with an obscure variable name. While the obfuscation can be suspicious, there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks in this snippet. The lack of active code or data processing suggests low immediate threat, but the obfuscation warrants caution if seen in a larger context.",
