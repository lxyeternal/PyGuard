  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "No actual code provided; analysis based on report descriptions indicating missing code.",
  "sinks": "No data or code to identify untrusted data sinks.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink flows can be established due to absence of code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; reports acknowledge missing code and avoid unwarranted assumptions.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly recognize the absence of code, leading to low confidence scores and zero malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores. The reasoning is consistent and cautious, with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores reflect the limited data, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "Given the lack of code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues. The reports' assessments are appropriate, and all scores are justified. The overall security risk remains minimal, with malware and obfuscation scores at zero and risk scores around 0.1–0.2.",
