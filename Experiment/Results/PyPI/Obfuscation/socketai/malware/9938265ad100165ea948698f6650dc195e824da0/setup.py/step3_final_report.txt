  "purpose": "The code collects system info, encodes it, splits into chunks, and performs DNS lookups with dynamically generated domain names during installation, indicating potential covert data exfiltration or command-and-control activity.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), json.dumps(), random.randint()",
  "sinks": "socket.getaddrinfo() calls resolving constructed domain names",
  "flows": "Data collection -> encoding -> chunking -> domain name construction -> DNS resolution",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class/method names, encoding of system info into hex, large random number usage in domain names, DNS lookups during install, undefined variables ('id_rand', 'value', 'domain') suggesting obfuscation or incomplete code",
  "analysis": "The code performs data collection of system info, encodes it into JSON and hex, splits into chunks, and performs DNS lookups with dynamically generated domain names based on this data. The obfuscation and network activity during package installation are suspicious and align with behaviors typical of malware, such as covert data exfiltration or C2 communication. The undefined variables indicate obfuscation or incomplete code, further raising suspicion. The pattern of DNS resolution with encoded data is a common tactic in malicious scripts to evade detection and establish covert channels.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious intent, likely functioning as a covert data exfiltration or command-and-control mechanism during package installation. The obfuscation, encoding, and network activity support a high malware and security risk profile.",
