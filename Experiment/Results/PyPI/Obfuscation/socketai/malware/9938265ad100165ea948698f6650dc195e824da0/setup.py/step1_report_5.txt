  "purpose": "Custom setup script that performs network activity during installation, possibly for tracking or malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "Socket information (socket.gethostname()), environment variables (getpass.getuser()), current directory (os.getcwd()), JSON data, random number generator.",
  "sinks": "socket.getaddrinfo() calls which resolve constructed domain names; data encoding that might be used for obfuscation.",
  "flows": "Collect environment and hostname info -> encode and split into chunks -> generate random number -> create domain names -> resolve domains via socket.getaddrinfo().",
  "anomalies": "Unusual network activity during package installation; encoding and splitting of data into chunks for potential exfiltration or command-and-control communication; use of random numbers for domain names; obfuscated variable names; dynamic hostname resolution with constructed domain names.",
  "analysis": "The code extends the standard setup process by executing additional code in a custom install command. It gathers system information such as hostname, current user, current directory, and encodes this data into a hex string. The data is then split into chunks and used to generate domain names that are resolved via socket.getaddrinfo(), which can indicate DNS-based communication or data exfiltration. The use of random large numbers for generating part of domain names suggests attempts at dynamic or hard-to-detect communication. The code’s obfuscation through unclear variable names and dynamic resolution of constructed domains is suspicious. The data encoding and network activity only occur during installation, which is unusual and potentially malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by performing hidden network communications during package installation, likely for tracking, data exfiltration, or establishing command-and-control channels. Its obfuscated structure and encoding further suggest malicious intent. This package should be considered highly suspicious and potentially dangerous.",
