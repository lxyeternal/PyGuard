  "purpose": "Import specific functions and classes from local modules and install an external Python package via pip.",
  "sources": "Local module imports, environment variables (sys.executable), and external URL for package installation.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executes a shell command that installs a package from an external URL.",
  "flows": "The sys.executable is used within the formatted string passed to os.system, which executes pip install from a URL.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system with a dynamically constructed command for installing a package from a remote URL, which is unusual and potentially malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several functions and classes from local modules, which appears normal. However, it then uses os.system to execute a shell command that runs pip install on a remote URL, specifically a tar.gz file hosted at pypihosted.org. This approach can be dangerous, as it downloads and installs code from an external source at runtime, which could be malicious. The use of sys.executable ensures the command runs with the current Python interpreter. The hardcoded version string '0.4.6' suggests reliance on a specific package version but does not mitigate the risk associated with dynamic installation from an untrusted source. The code does not verify the authenticity or integrity of the package before installation, posing significant security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a potentially malicious behavior by downloading and installing a package from an external URL at runtime without verification. While the initial imports are typical, the dynamic external installation poses a security risk, potentially enabling supply chain attacks.",
