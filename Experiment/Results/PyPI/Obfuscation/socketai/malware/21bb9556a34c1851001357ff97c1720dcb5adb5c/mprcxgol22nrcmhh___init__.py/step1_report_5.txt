{
  "purpose": "Import various modules and functions, then install a specific package version from an external URL",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules; reading from sys.executable and the URL in os.system call",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing pip install with a remote URL, which could be malicious if the URL is compromised",
  "flows": "Imports (local) -> os.system executes pip install from remote URL",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system to install a package directly from a remote URL, which is unusual and potentially dangerous; no validation of the package source or integrity check shown",
  "analysis": "The code imports internal modules with obfuscated function names, possibly to conceal intent. It then installs a package directly from an external URL using os.system, which can be exploited to execute malicious code if the URL is compromised or malicious. The package source is a custom domain with a non-standard URL, raising suspicion. The package version is hardcoded and there are no safety checks or signature verifications. The approach indicates possible malicious intent or a security risk due to untrusted code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code dynamically installs a package from a remote URL using os.system, which is a significant security concern. The use of obfuscated imports combined with remote package installation suggests malicious or maliciously intended behavior. The overall risk is high, and the code should be treated with suspicion.",
