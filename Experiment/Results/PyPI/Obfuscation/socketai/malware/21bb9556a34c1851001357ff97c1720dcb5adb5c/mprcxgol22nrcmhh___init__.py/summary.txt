  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious or highly insecure behavior by installing packages from an untrusted remote source at runtime without validation. This pattern is indicative of potential supply chain attacks or malicious payload execution. The high malware and risk scores are justified, and the code should be considered dangerous and refactored to ensure supply chain integrity."
