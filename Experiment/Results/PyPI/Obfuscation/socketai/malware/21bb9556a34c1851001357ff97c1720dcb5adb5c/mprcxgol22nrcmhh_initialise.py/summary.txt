  "conclusion": "The code exhibits obfuscated stream management with potential for misuse, but lacks direct evidence of malicious activity. Its behavior warrants caution, especially considering the obfuscation and external module import. The malware score is set to 0.2, reflecting low but cautious suspicion; the obfuscation score is high at 0.8; the overall security risk is moderate at 0.4. Further analysis of the imported module and context is recommended before deployment."
