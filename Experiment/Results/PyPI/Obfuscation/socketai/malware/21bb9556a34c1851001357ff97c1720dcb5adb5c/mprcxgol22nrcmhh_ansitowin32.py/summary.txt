  "conclusion": "The code functions as an advanced, obfuscated terminal output handler with environment-aware features. While no direct malicious activity is confirmed, the high obfuscation and environment-dependent logic warrant caution. The low malware score (0.2) and high obfuscation score (0.8) are appropriate, with a moderate security risk score (0.4) reflecting potential covert use. Further review of external modules and runtime behavior is recommended before deployment."
