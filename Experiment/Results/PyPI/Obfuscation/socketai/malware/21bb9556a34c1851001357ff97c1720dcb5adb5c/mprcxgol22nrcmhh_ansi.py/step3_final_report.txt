  "purpose": "Generate ANSI escape sequences for terminal styling and obfuscation.",
  "sources": "Functions and class attributes that construct escape sequences and numeric identifiers.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no external data, network, or file I/O; primarily string construction.",
  "flows": "Function calls generate escape sequences; class attributes initialized with control strings; no external data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation via variable names and dynamic string concatenation; use of getattr/setattr for dynamic attribute assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to create ANSI escape sequences, uses obfuscated variable names, and constructs classes with attributes representing control codes. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. The obfuscation could be for styling or concealment, but no active malicious behavior is evident. The scores from reports are consistent: low malware (around 0.1-0.2), high obfuscation (around 0.75), and low risk (around 0.2-0.3). The code appears benign, primarily for terminal styling or obfuscation, with no direct evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is heavily obfuscated terminal control sequence generation with no active malicious payloads or behaviors. The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not justify high malware or risk scores. The current assessments are appropriate; the code is likely benign but should be monitored if part of larger, untrusted codebases.",
