  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is heavily obfuscated terminal control sequence generation with no active malicious payloads or behaviors. The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not justify high malware or risk scores. The current assessments are appropriate; the code is likely benign but should be monitored if part of larger, untrusted codebases."
