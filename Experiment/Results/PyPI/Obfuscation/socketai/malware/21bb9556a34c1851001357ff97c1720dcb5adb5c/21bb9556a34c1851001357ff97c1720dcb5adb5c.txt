      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code functions as an advanced, obfuscated terminal output handler with environment-aware features. While no direct malicious activity is confirmed, the high obfuscation and environment-dependent logic warrant caution. The low malware score (0.2) and high obfuscation score (0.8) are appropriate, with a moderate security risk score (0.4) reflecting potential covert use. Further review of external modules and runtime behavior is recommended before deployment."

      "obfuscated": 0.7,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious or highly insecure behavior by installing packages from an untrusted remote source at runtime without validation. This pattern is indicative of potential supply chain attacks or malicious payload execution. The high malware and risk scores are justified, and the code should be considered dangerous and refactored to ensure supply chain integrity."

      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits obfuscated stream management with potential for misuse, but lacks direct evidence of malicious activity. Its behavior warrants caution, especially considering the obfuscation and external module import. The malware score is set to 0.2, reflecting low but cautious suspicion; the obfuscation score is high at 0.8; the overall security risk is moderate at 0.4. Further analysis of the imported module and context is recommended before deployment."

      "conclusion": "The analyzed code is heavily obfuscated terminal control sequence generation with no active malicious payloads or behaviors. The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not justify high malware or risk scores. The current assessments are appropriate; the code is likely benign but should be monitored if part of larger, untrusted codebases."

While no direct malicious activity is explicitly demonstrated, the suspicious import and obfuscated structure warrant treating this code as potentially malicious and requiring further analysis before use."
