      "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious indicators, including obfuscation, external network activity during setup, and lack of validation. It should be flagged as malicious, and caution is advised before using this package. The high malware and risk scores are justified by the pattern of behavior, indicating a high probability of malicious activity."

      "conclusion": "Given the absence of code, all reports should reflect minimal or no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk. The current scores in some reports overstate potential threats; they should be adjusted to zero where no evidence exists. The most accurate assessment is that there is no detectable malicious behavior or obfuscation based solely on the provided reports."
