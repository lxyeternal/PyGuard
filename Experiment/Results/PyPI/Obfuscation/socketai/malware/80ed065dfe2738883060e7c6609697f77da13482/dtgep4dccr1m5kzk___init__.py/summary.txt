  "conclusion": "Given the absence of code, all reports should reflect minimal or no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk. The current scores in some reports overstate potential threats; they should be adjusted to zero where no evidence exists. The most accurate assessment is that there is no detectable malicious behavior or obfuscation based solely on the provided reports."
