  "purpose": "Evaluate supply chain security of the open source dependency by analyzing provided code snippets or reports for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "No explicit sources identified; no code provided in the reports.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or sinks present due to absence of code.",
  "flows": "No data flows observable without code.",
  "anomalies": "Lack of code makes anomaly detection impossible; some reports mention obfuscation or dynamic features without evidence.",
  "analysis": "All reports lack actual code snippets; scores assigned (malware, obfuscation, risk) are inconsistent in some cases, especially where no code exists. Reports 1, 2, and 5 correctly assign zero scores due to absence of code. Reports 3 and 4 assign non-zero scores based on potential concerns like network activity or obfuscation, but without concrete evidence, these should be lowered. Specifically, malware scores in reports 2, 3, and 5 should be zero; risk scores in reports 2 and 3 should also be zero; obfuscation and malware scores in report 4 should be reduced to zero unless explicit evidence of obfuscation or malicious code is present. Overall, the scores overstate potential risks given the lack of code, leading to an overestimation of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Given the absence of code, all reports should reflect minimal or no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk. The current scores in some reports overstate potential threats; they should be adjusted to zero where no evidence exists. The most accurate assessment is that there is no detectable malicious behavior or obfuscation based solely on the provided reports.",
