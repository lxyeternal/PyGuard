{
  "purpose": "The code defines a function with an obfuscated name that executes a system command to download a file from a suspicious URL during package setup, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The function 'nrqRELqblwoCCnBBPSWaGcgdAaSgnaMi' which calls os.system() to run 'wget' fetching from the external URL.",
  "sinks": "The os.system() call executing 'wget' which downloads external content potentially leading to remote code execution or malware infection.",
  "flows": "The function is invoked immediately after definition, causing the external 'wget' command to run during script execution, establishing a source-to-sink flow from function call to network activity.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function name, immediate execution of external download during setup, lack of validation or error handling, and the use of a suspicious URL hosted on a potentially malicious domain.",
  "analysis": "The code contains an obfuscated function that executes a 'wget' command to download from a suspicious URL during setup, with no validation or safeguards. The immediate invocation suggests malicious intent, typical of supply chain attacks. The high suspicion is supported by the obfuscation, external URL, and execution pattern. Scores of 0.9 for malware and security risk, and 0.8 for obfuscation, are justified based on these indicators. The pattern aligns with known malicious tactics such as remote payload delivery and backdoors. While the code does not confirm the payload's content, the behavior warrants high concern. The scores are consistent across reports and appropriately reflect the malicious potential.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious indicators, including obfuscation, external network activity during setup, and lack of validation. It should be flagged as malicious, and caution is advised before using this package. The high malware and risk scores are justified by the pattern of behavior, indicating a high probability of malicious activity.",
