  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution conditioned on filesystem state, with silent error handling. It aligns with common supply chain attack techniques. Further decoding of the PowerShell payload is recommended to confirm malicious intent."
