{
  "purpose": "The script appears to set up a Python package but includes code that executes a hidden PowerShell command, potentially for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the file system with os.path.exists and executes an external process via subprocess.Popen with a Base64-encoded PowerShell command.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen executes a hidden PowerShell command that could be used to download or run malicious payloads, possibly exfiltrate data or perform other harmful actions.",
  "flows": "The flow begins with checking for a file; if not found, it executes a concealed PowerShell command, which could lead to remote code execution or data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "The use of Base64-encoded PowerShell command with -EncodedCommand, hidden window style, and the obfuscated nature of the string are suspicious. The code runs potentially malicious code silently without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The script imports distutils for setup, which is normal for packaging, but it then performs a check for a file 'tahg'. If the file does not exist, it executes a Base64-encoded PowerShell command in a hidden window, which is a common technique for malicious payload delivery. The command is highly obfuscated and run without clear indication of its purpose, indicating malicious intent. The setup call is benign but seems overshadowed by the malicious payload execution. The use of broad exception handling masks potential errors, preventing detection or debugging. Overall, the code exhibits suspicious behavior typical of malicious code delivery or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains obfuscated malicious behavior intended to run hidden PowerShell commands, likely for malicious activities such as remote code execution or data exfiltration. The presence of obfuscated commands, silent execution, and conditional checks suggest a malicious payload designed to evade detection.",
