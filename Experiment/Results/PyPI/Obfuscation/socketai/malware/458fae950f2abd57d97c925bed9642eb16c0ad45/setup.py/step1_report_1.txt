{
  "purpose": "The script appears to set up a Python package and execute a hidden PowerShell command, potentially for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the filesystem (checking for 'tahg'), and executes a PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen.",
  "sinks": "Execution of a hidden PowerShell command that may perform further actions or download malicious payloads.",
  "flows": "Filesystem check → Conditional execution of PowerShell command → PowerShell command runs in background.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated PowerShell command encoded in base64; launching a process with hidden window; minimal error handling; untrusted external command execution.",
  "analysis": "The code first checks if a directory 'tahg' exists. If not, it executes a PowerShell command encoded in base64, launched with a hidden window. The PowerShell command appears to be obfuscated and likely performs additional malicious actions such as downloading files or establishing connections. The setup call seems standard but is wrapped in a try-except block with no error handling, which might hide issues. The code's obfuscation and use of hidden processes strongly suggest malicious intent, especially considering the encoded PowerShell payload.",
  "conclusion": "The script is potentially malicious, primarily due to the obfuscated PowerShell command executed in the background and the lack of transparency about its actions. While the setup function appears legitimate, the embedded command and process handling indicate a high likelihood of malicious behavior.",
