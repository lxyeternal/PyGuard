      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential through remote code fetch and execution, obfuscation, and system manipulation. The reports' assessments are accurate and justified, and the overall security risk is extremely high. The package should be considered malicious and avoided unless remote content is verified safe, which is unlikely."
