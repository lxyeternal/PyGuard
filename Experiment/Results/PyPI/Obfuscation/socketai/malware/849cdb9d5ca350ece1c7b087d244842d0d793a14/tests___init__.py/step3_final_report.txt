  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code reading input data, environment variables, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), hardcoded secrets.",
  "sinks": "Potential data exfiltration, network connections, file modifications, environment variable leaks.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or untrusted input flow into eval/exec or network functions.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation, dynamic code execution, insecure practices like eval/exec without validation, lack of comments.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits high obfuscation and dynamic execution patterns, which are common indicators of malicious intent but can also be used legitimately. The absence of concrete payloads or malicious actions limits certainty. Usage of eval/exec without validation is a security concern. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are explicitly identified. The suspicious patterns justify high malware and obfuscation scores, while insecure practices warrant a moderate security risk score.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows strong indicators of obfuscation and risky practices, suggesting a high likelihood of malicious behavior, but lacks definitive proof. The scores reflect suspicion rather than confirmed malicious activity. Further manual review with actual code snippets is recommended for confirmation.",
