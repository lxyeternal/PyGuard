  "purpose": "Evaluate open-source dependency reports for malicious behavior or security risks based on provided code analysis summaries.",
  "sources": "No code provided; assessments are based on descriptions and inferred patterns.",
  "sinks": "Not applicable; no untrusted data flows identified due to lack of code.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no source-to-sink flows observable without code.",
  "anomalies": "Potential suspicion in Report 4 regarding dynamic execution and hardcoded secrets, but no concrete code evidence.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly acknowledge the absence of code, assigning low or zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and risk. Report 4 discusses suspicious patterns but lacks actual code snippets, leading to inflated suspicion scores. Adjusting scores for Report 4 to reflect lack of concrete evidence results in lower malware (0.2) and risk (0.2) scores. Other reports are consistent with their descriptions, showing minimal concern. Overall, the assessments are appropriate given the limited information.",
  "conclusion": "The reports are consistent with the absence of code, with Report 4's suspicion being speculative. Adjusting malware and risk scores for Report 4 downward aligns with evidence-based assessment. The overall security posture remains benign, with minimal risk and no confirmed malicious activity.",
