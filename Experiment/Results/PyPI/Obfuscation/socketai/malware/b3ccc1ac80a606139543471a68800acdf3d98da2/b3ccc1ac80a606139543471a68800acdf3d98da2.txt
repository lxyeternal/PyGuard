      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity, with obfuscated, covert PowerShell execution during package setup. The techniques used are typical of malicious payload delivery, and the overall security risk is significant. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; I recommend considering this package as malicious with high malware (~0.85), obfuscation (~0.9), and security risk (~0.85) scores."
