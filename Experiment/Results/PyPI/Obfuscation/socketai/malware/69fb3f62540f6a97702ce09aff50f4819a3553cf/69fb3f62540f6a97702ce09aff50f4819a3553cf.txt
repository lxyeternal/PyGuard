      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior characteristic of malware used for covert data collection, exfiltration, and reconnaissance. It employs obfuscation, encoding, and silent error handling to evade detection. The activities involve exfiltrating sensitive system and credential data to external servers, indicating high malicious intent. The overall security risk is very high, and the malware score should be set to 1.0, with obfuscation around 0.8, and security risk close to 0.95."

      "conclusion": "The dependency contains potentially malicious features, notably obfuscation and dynamic code execution, justifying elevated malware and security risk scores. Benign assessments are valid but do not negate the suspicious indicators present in report 5. The overall security posture should be considered high risk pending further code review."

      "conclusion": "All reports correctly identify that the code is benign and only contains a simple import statement. The malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero. The security risk score should be set to 0, reflecting the harmless nature of the code. No evidence suggests malicious intent or obfuscation. The assessments are consistent and accurate, requiring no adjustments."
