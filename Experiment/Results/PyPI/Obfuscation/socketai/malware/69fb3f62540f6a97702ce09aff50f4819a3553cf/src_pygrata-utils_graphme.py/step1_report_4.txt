  "purpose": "The code imports the 'os' module, likely to interact with the operating system.",
  "sources": "The import statement reading the 'os' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present in the code; no data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "No data flows or processing occurs beyond the import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal with only an import statement; no suspicious or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The provided code contains a single import statement for the 'os' module. There are no further instructions, data manipulations, or function calls. Without additional code, it is impossible to determine any malicious intent or security issues. The presence of 'os' is common for system interactions, but on its own, it does not indicate malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is too minimal to assess further, but there are no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.",
