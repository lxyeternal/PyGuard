  "conclusion": "The dependency contains potentially malicious features, notably obfuscation and dynamic code execution, justifying elevated malware and security risk scores. Benign assessments are valid but do not negate the suspicious indicators present in report 5. The overall security posture should be considered high risk pending further code review."
