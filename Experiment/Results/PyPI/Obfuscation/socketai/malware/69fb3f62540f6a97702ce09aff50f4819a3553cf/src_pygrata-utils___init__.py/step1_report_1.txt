  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be a Python package, potentially for general utility or application development.",
  "sources": "Reads data from environment variables, input functions, and potentially from network or files depending on context not shown here.",
  "sinks": "Possible sinks include system calls, network communications, or file writes that could process untrusted data, but specifics depend on full code context.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources such as environment variables or user input to sinks like system functions, network calls, or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated code detected. The code structure appears standard; no unusual patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code analysis shows standard Python functions and imports with no signs of malicious behavior. No backdoors, data exfiltration, or harmful system modifications are evident. Usage of third-party libraries seems typical and not suspicious. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated logic, or malicious patterns identified. Given the absence of suspicious code segments, the code seems benign based on the provided snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a normal, benign Python module without any signs of malicious intent or security risks. No anomalies or malware indicators are detected in the current analysis.",
