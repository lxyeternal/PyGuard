    "Hardcoded URL pointing to a suspicious domain (files.inostage.ru)."
  ],
  "analysis": "The code retrieves the hostname and constructs a URL, then fetches content from a remote server and executes it dynamically. The use of 'exec' on external data is highly suspicious and a common technique for executing malicious payloads. The variable 'url_check' is used without being defined in the snippet, indicating incomplete code or an error. The URL points to an external domain that could host malicious scripts. The code demonstrates potentially malicious behavior by executing remote code without validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential due to the dynamic execution of remote content, which could lead to system compromise or data theft. The use of 'exec' on externally fetched data is a significant security concern.",
