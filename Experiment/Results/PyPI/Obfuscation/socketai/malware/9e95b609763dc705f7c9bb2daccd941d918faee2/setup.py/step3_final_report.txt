{
  "purpose": "The code exfiltrates system information (hostname, IP, platform details) during package installation via a hardcoded Discord webhook, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), socket.gethostbyname(), platform.* functions, and the hardcoded webhook URL.",
  "sinks": "Sending data to the Discord webhook URL, which transmits system info externally.",
  "flows": "Source functions (hostname, IP, platform info) → data sent via webhook to external server during install.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names, nonsensical dependency 'sockets' (which does not exist), and data exfiltration during setup.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, during installation, imports modules (aiohttp, requests, discord), gathers system info, and exfiltrates it via a hardcoded Discord webhook. The class and method names are obfuscated, and dependencies include invalid or suspicious packages, indicating obfuscation and malicious intent. The exfiltration occurs automatically during package setup, which is a supply chain attack vector. The webhook URL is hardcoded, and the code does not perform any other benign function. The presence of obfuscation, suspicious dependencies, and data exfiltration confirms malicious behavior. The code's behavior is consistent with known malicious supply chain attacks, and the signals strongly suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, performing unauthorized data exfiltration during installation. The obfuscation and suspicious dependencies support this. The activity poses a high security risk, and the package should be flagged and removed. The malware score should be set to 1, the obfuscated score around 0.8, and the security risk at 1.0 for maximum severity.",
