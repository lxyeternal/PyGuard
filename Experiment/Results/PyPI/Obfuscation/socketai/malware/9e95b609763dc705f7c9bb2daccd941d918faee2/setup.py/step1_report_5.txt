{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up a Python package and includes a custom install command that performs malicious activities, specifically exfiltrating system information to an external Discord webhook during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads system hostname, IP address, and platform details within the custom install class method.",
  "sinks": "The webhook URL receives system information via the Discord API, which acts as a sink for exfiltrated data.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom class method is invoked, which gathers system info and sends it to the webhook, creating a source-to-sink data flow.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes obfuscated class and method names, performs network communication during installation, and sends sensitive system info to an external server, which is suspicious behavior. The use of non-standard dependency 'Cmake' and the unusual class/method naming also stand out.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools but defines a custom install class that overrides the installation process. This custom class collects hostname, IP, and platform info and sends it to a Discord webhook URL, which is suspicious as it indicates potential data exfiltration. The dependencies listed include 'sockets' (which is not a standard package), 'discord.py', 'aiohttp', 'Cmake', 'wheel', and 'requests'. The use of 'Cmake' as a dependency is unconventional and potentially suspicious. The code executes during package installation, which is a common tactic for malicious behavior such as spying or data theft. The obfuscated class and method names are indicators of intent to hide malicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be malicious, designed to exfiltrate system information upon installation via a Discord webhook, indicating a supply chain attack vector. It uses obfuscation and suspicious dependencies to hide malicious behavior. The overall security risk is high due to the data exfiltration activity occurring automatically during package installation.",
