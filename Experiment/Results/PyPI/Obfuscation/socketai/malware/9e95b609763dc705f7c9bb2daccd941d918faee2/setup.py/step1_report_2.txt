{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that includes a custom installation command to execute potentially malicious activities during installation.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), socket.gethostbyname(), import statements, the webhook URL",
  "sinks": "Webhook send method (AKMpCaNrUEDEhkIYnvFLGxgvtiZmjBzl.send)",
  "flows": "During installation, the code retrieves system hostname and IP, then sends this information via a Discord webhook, along with system details.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class and method names; sending system information to an external URL during install; inclusion of suspicious webhook URL; import of unusual modules like 'platform' and 'requests' without further use; 'install_requires' includes non-standard package 'sockets' (which does not exist).",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom 'install' class that, when executed, gathers system hostname, IP address, and platform details, then transmits this information to a Discord webhook URL. The webhook URL appears to be hardcoded, and the obfuscated class/method names suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent. The use of 'install_requires' includes a non-existent package 'sockets', which indicates possible obfuscation or malicious intent. The code executes during package installation, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, and sends potentially sensitive system info to an external server.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains malicious behavior by collecting system information and exfiltrating it during installation via a Discord webhook. The obfuscation and suspicious package requirements further indicate malicious intent. The code's purpose appears to be spying or data theft via the installation process.",
