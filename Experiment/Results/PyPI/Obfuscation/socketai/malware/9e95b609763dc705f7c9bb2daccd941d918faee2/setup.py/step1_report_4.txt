  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package with a custom install command that collects system information and sends it to a Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), socket.gethostbyname(), imported modules (aiohttp, requests, discord), webhook URL",
  "sinks": "Webhook send method (AKMpCaNrUEDEhkIYnvFLGxgvtiZmjBzl.send)",
  "flows": "System info gathered from socket and platform modules → data sent via Discord webhook",
  "anomalies": "Use of a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, collecting hostname and IP address during installation, sending data without user consent",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, during installation, imports several modules including 'aiohttp', 'requests', and 'discord'. It retrieves system hostname and IP address, then sends this information along with system details to a specified Discord webhook. The setup script specifies dependencies, some of which are unnecessary or misspelled (e.g., 'sockets' instead of 'socket', 'Cmake' likely intended as 'cmake'). The key suspicious behavior is the automatic collection and exfiltration of system information during package installation without user awareness or consent, indicating potential malicious activity. The hardcoded webhook URL further supports malicious intent, as it enables remote data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes malicious behavior by collecting system information and sending it to an external server via a webhook during installation, likely for tracking or malicious purposes. The use of a hardcoded webhook URL and data exfiltration during setup are strong indicators of malicious intent.",
