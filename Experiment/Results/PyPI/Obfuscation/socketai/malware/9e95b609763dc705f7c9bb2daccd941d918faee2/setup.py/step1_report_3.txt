{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that, during installation, executes a custom install command which sends system information to a Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), socket.gethostbyname(), import statements, webhook URL",
  "sinks": "AKMpCaNrUEDEhkIYnvFLGxgvtiZmjBzl.send() calls to Discord webhook",
  "flows": "Installation process triggers the custom command, which collects hostname, IP address, platform info, and sends it to the webhook",
  "anomalies": "The code is obfuscated with unusual class and method names, uses dynamic data collection and exfiltration without user consent, and references a suspicious webhook URL. The package dependencies include 'sockets' (which is not a valid package), and the webhook URL is hardcoded.",
  "analysis": "The setup script creates a custom install command class with obfuscated method names that, when run, gathers system information such as hostname, IP address, and platform details. It then sends this data to a Discord webhook URL, potentially exfiltrating user system info without consent. The code relies on third-party libraries, including 'discord' and 'aiohttp', and also imports 'requests'. The presence of a hardcoded webhook URL and the collection of system details are suspicious, indicating possible data leakage or malicious intent. The dependencies list includes 'sockets', which is invalid and may cause errors, but the core malicious behavior is the data exfiltration during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior—collecting and sending system information to an external Discord webhook during package installation. The obfuscation and hardcoded webhook URL suggest an intent to exfiltrate user data without consent. The overall security risk is high, and the package should be considered unsafe to use.",
