{
  "purpose": "The code downloads two executable payloads from Discord CDN URLs, saves them in a system directory, renames them to mimic Windows system files, executes them silently, and cleans up temporary files and directories. Its purpose appears to be malicious payload delivery and execution.",
  "sources": "Requests to external URLs (Discord CDN links) for payloads, reading URL content; writing files to disk; renaming files; executing files via os.startfile; deleting files and directories.",
  "sinks": "Execution of downloaded files via os.startfile; renaming files into system directories; silent cleanup of temporary files; potential persistence via placement in system-like directories.",
  "flows": "Download payloads from URLs -> Save as temporary files -> Rename files into system directory -> Execute files -> Remove temporary files and directory.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; silent exception handling (try/except pass); writing executable files into a Windows system directory; downloading from suspicious URLs; executing unverified external payloads without validation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs malicious activities by downloading executable payloads from external sources, storing them in a system directory, executing them silently, and cleaning up traces. Variable names are obfuscated, and error handling suppresses failures, typical of malicious scripts. The URLs are hosted on Discord CDN, which is often exploited for malicious payload hosting. The actions taken—downloading, renaming, executing without validation, and cleanup—are consistent with malware delivery mechanisms. The high malware score (1.0) is justified by active payload execution, high obfuscation score (0.8) due to variable name obfuscation, and high security risk score (1.0) because of the potential for system compromise and stealthy malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious intent, involving downloading, executing, and hiding payloads in system directories. The behavior aligns with typical malware activity, and the scores assigned in the reports are justified. It should be classified as high severity malware with maximum security concern.",
