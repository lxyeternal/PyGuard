{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for malicious activity by downloading and executing potentially harmful executables from external URLs and placing them in a system directory.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from two external URLs (Discord CDN links) using requests.get(), which are used to download executable files.",
  "sinks": "The downloaded content is written directly to files named 'ZYXMN.exe' and 'ZYRBX.exe' and then renamed and executed via os.startfile(), leading to execution of potentially malicious binaries.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the external URLs (sources) through requests.get() to local files ('ZYXMN.exe', 'ZYRBX.exe'), which are then renamed and executed with os.startfile().",
  "anomalies": "Unusual use of system directories (C:\\$Windows.~SXK) for storing executables, renaming downloaded files, and executing them without verification. The code also attempts to delete these files afterward. The code contains obfuscated variable names and unstructured setup configuration, typical of malicious scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with setup metadata, then defines a directory and attempts to create it. It proceeds to download two executable files from URLs hosted on Discord CDN, saving and renaming them within a system directory. It then executes these files and attempts to delete the temporary copies. The use of hardcoded URLs, obfuscated variable names, and placing executables in a system directory indicates malicious intent to download, hide, and execute malicious binaries surreptitiously.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious and likely malicious. It downloads and executes external executables without user consent, placing them in system directories, which is characteristic of malware. The obfuscation and lack of any legitimate purpose reinforce this conclusion.",
