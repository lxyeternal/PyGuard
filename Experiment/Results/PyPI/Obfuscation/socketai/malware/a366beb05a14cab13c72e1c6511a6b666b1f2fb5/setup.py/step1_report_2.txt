{
  "purpose": "The script appears to download and execute two executable files from Discord CDN, rename them, and run them, likely for malicious purposes such as remote control or malware delivery.",
  "sources": "requests.get calls to external URLs, reading from network sources.",
  "sinks": "Writing files to disk ('ZYXMN.exe', 'ZYRBX.exe'), executing files via os.startfile, removing temporary files and directories.",
  "flows": "Requests download data from external URLs → writes to local files → renames files to system-like paths → executes the files → deletes temporary files and directories.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names, downloading executables from Discord CDN (suspicious source), writing and executing files without validation, silent exception handling which suppresses errors, creating and deleting a directory in a system path, possibly to hide malicious files.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple modules, including requests and os, with obfuscated variable names. It creates a directory in a Windows system folder, then downloads two executables from Discord CDN links. It writes these executables to the disk, renames them to mimic legitimate Windows files, and executes them. It then attempts to clean up by deleting the temporary files and the directory. The behavior—downloading and executing files from a third-party server, especially from Discord, with obfuscation—is characteristic of malicious malware delivery or backdoor setup. The code also suppresses exceptions, which can hide failures or malicious intent. All these factors indicate likely malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The script exhibits behaviors typical of malware—downloading, renaming, executing malicious executables, and cleaning up traces. Its obfuscated variables and use of Discord CDN for payload delivery strongly suggest malicious intent. It should not be used and poses a high security risk.",
