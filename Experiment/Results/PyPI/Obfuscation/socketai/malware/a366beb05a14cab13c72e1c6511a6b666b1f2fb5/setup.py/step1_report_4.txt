  "flows": [
    "Download from Discord CDN -> save as temporary files -> rename files to system directory -> execute files"
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "Use of hardcoded URLs pointing to potentially malicious executables",
    "Writing executables directly to a Windows system directory without user consent",
    "Silent removal of temporary files after download",
    "Unconditional execution of downloaded files without verification"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing necessary modules and defining several variables with obfuscated names. It creates a directory at 'C:\\$Windows.~SXK' if it does not exist. Two URLs are hardcoded, pointing to executable files hosted on Discord CDN. The code attempts to download these files and save them as temporary files, then renames them to system directory with specific filenames. It proceeds to delete the temporary files and finally executes the renamed files. The process operates without any user prompts or validation, which strongly suggests malicious intent, such as delivering malware payloads or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This script is highly suspicious due to its behavior of downloading, renaming, and executing external executables from a remote server, likely for malicious purposes. Its use of obfuscated variable names, silent file operations, and execution without user consent indicates malicious intent and system compromise risk.",
