{
  "purpose": "The code appears to download, rename, and execute two executable files from remote URLs, then cleans up the temporary directory. Its purpose seems to be to run potentially malicious payloads silently.",
  "sources": "Requests to external URLs ('https://cdn.discordapp.com/.../ZYXMN.exe' and '.../ZYRBX.exe') for downloading payloads.",
  "sinks": "Writing content to files ('ZYXMN.exe', 'ZYRBX.exe'), renaming files, executing files via os.startfile, and removing temporary directories.",
  "flows": "Download payloads from external sources -> Save as temporary files -> Rename files to system paths -> Execute files -> Remove temporary directory.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, downloading executable files from suspicious URLs, saving them into system-like directories with hidden naming conventions, silent execution without user consent, cleanup of temp files and directories, minimal error handling which suppresses exceptions, no validation of downloaded content, use of hardcoded paths.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by setting up package metadata with obfuscated variable names, which is unusual but not malicious. It then creates a directory at 'C:\\$Windows.~SXK' and attempts to download two executable files from Discord CDN URLs, which are potentially malicious hosting sites. It writes these files locally, renames them to appear as legitimate system files, and then executes them silently. The cleanup process removes the temporary directory. The code’s behavior indicates it is designed to install and run malicious payloads without user awareness or consent. The use of hardcoded paths, silent operations, and downloading from suspicious URLs strongly suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and exhibits behaviors typical of malware, such as downloading and executing payloads from untrusted sources, hiding files, and cleaning up traces. Its purpose appears to be to deliver and run malicious software stealthily.",
