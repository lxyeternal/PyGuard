  "purpose": "Assess the supply chain security and malicious potential of the open source dependency based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "No actual code provided; assessments based on summaries and descriptions of code behavior.",
  "sinks": "Not explicitly identified due to lack of code; potential concern if code contained malicious network requests or data leaks, but none indicated.",
  "flows": "Not determinable without code; reports suggest benign data processing or network interactions without malicious intent.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns detected; reports explicitly note absence of obfuscation, secrets, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "All five reports consistently conclude the code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious features. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate given the limited information. Confidence levels vary but are justified based on the lack of actual code. The reasoning in each report aligns with the summaries, and no contradictions or red flags are evident. The collective evaluation supports a low-risk, benign assessment of the dependency.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency appears safe with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the risk score reflects minimal concern. The assessments are consistent and appropriate given the available information.",
