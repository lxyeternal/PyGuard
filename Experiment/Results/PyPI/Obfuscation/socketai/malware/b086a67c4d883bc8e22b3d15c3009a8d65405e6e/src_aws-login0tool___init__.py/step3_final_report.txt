  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include environment variables, user inputs, network data, and file reads.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are eval()/exec() calls, network transmissions, file modifications, environment variable access, and hardcoded secrets.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources like untrusted input or environment variables to sinks such as eval()/exec() or network functions, indicating potential malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "Untrusted code execution (eval/exec), hardcoded secrets, suspicious data flows, obfuscation patterns, and dynamic code generation.",
  "analysis": "The code's use of eval()/exec() on untrusted input, presence of hardcoded secrets, and suspicious data flows are strong indicators of malicious intent. Lack of code prevents confirmation in some reports, but where present, risky behaviors justify high malware scores. Absence of suspicious patterns or code leads to low scores. Obfuscation suspicion is minimal but noted in some cases. The overall assessment aligns with the described behaviors, with high confidence in reports indicating malicious activity and low confidence where data is absent.",
  "conclusion": "Report 1's detailed behaviors justify a high malware score (~0.75) and security risk (~0.85). Other reports, lacking evidence, appropriately have low or zero scores. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
