{
  "purpose": "The function appears to increment a given number by 1.",
  "sources": "The function takes a single input parameter 'number'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present; the code does not send or store data externally.",
  "flows": "Input 'number' flows directly into the addition operation, resulting in 'number + 1'.",
  "anomalies": "The function name appears obfuscated or randomly generated, which could be suspicious. However, it performs a trivial operation with no hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple function that adds 1 to the input parameter. The function name appears intentionally obscure but does not influence behavior. There are no external calls, data leaks, or suspicious code constructs. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a simple increment operation. The obfuscated function name alone does not indicate malicious behavior. No malicious or security risks are detected.",
