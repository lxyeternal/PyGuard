  "purpose": "A simple function that increments a number by 1.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'number' to the function.",
  "sinks": "Return statement outputs the incremented value.",
  "flows": "Input 'number' flows directly into the addition operation, then the result flows out as the return value.",
  "anomalies": "The function name appears obfuscated, which could suggest intent to hide functionality. No other suspicious code, external network calls, or data leaks are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function with a deliberately obfuscated name. It performs a basic arithmetic operation: adding 1 to the input parameter and returning the result. There are no external dependencies, no input validation, no environment variable usage, and no signs of malicious activity. The obfuscated name might indicate an attempt to conceal purpose, but the code itself is straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and appears benign. Its obfuscated name is the only potential concern but does not indicate malicious intent. There are no signs of malware or security risks in this snippet.",
