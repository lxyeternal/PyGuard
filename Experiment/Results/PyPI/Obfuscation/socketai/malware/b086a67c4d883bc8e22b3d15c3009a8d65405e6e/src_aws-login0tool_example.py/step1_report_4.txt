{
  "purpose": "A simple function that increments a number by 1.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'number'.",
  "sinks": "Return statement that outputs the incremented value.",
  "flows": "Input 'number' flows directly into the addition operation, and the result is returned.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code constructs, and no obfuscation. Function name appears random, but this is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function with a seemingly random name that takes a single input and returns that input incremented by one. There are no external data sources, no data leaks, no unsafe operations, and no evidence of malicious behavior. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no complex control flow or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a basic arithmetic operation with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be benign, simple, and unlikely to be part of malicious activity.",
