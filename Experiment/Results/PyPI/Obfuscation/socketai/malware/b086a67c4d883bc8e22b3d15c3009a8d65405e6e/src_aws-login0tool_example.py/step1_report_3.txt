{
  "purpose": "The function appears to increment a given number by 1, likely intended for simple arithmetic or utility.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'number' (presumably from function call context).",
  "sinks": "Return statement; no external or sensitive data outputs or network interactions.",
  "flows": "Input 'number' flows directly into an addition operation, then is returned.",
  "anomalies": "The function name is obfuscated or nonsensical, which is unusual; no other suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting of a single function that adds 1 to its input. The function name 'eHACBHAoTxzyRdlUXXqjYsfswBHMCGzn' is random and does not convey purpose, which might suggest obfuscation. There are no external data sources, no network operations, no file I/O, and no use of environment variables. The logic is straightforward and does not contain any malicious constructs or behaviors. Given the simplicity, there is no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or malware. The obfuscated name could be for evasion, but the actual code behavior is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple increment function with an obfuscated name. It does not demonstrate malicious behavior or security risks. The only concern is the obfuscated naming, which may suggest an attempt to hide purpose, but functionally it is harmless.",
