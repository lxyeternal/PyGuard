  "purpose": "A simple function that increments a number by 1.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'number' received by the function.",
  "sinks": "Return statement outputs the incremented number; no external sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Input 'number' flows directly to the return statement after incrementing.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function name; no other anomalies or suspicious code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward increment function with an obfuscated name. No external dependencies, network activity, or file I/O are present. The function performs a benign arithmetic operation. The obfuscated name could be an attempt to conceal purpose but does not indicate malicious intent. Scores assigned in reports are consistent with the benign nature, with malware score at 0, obfuscation score around 0.6, and minimal security risk (~0.1). No evidence suggests malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a trivial operation with an obfuscated name. The risk is minimal, and no malicious activity is detected. Obfuscation alone does not imply malicious intent, but it warrants a slightly higher obfuscation score.",
