{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package named 'Distutil' with metadata, but the main intent appears suspicious due to obfuscated code that executes decoded payload.",
  "sources": "The encoded base64 payload executed via exec(), which is decoded from a base64-encoded string embedded in the script.",
  "sinks": "The exec() function executes the decoded code, which can lead to arbitrary code execution and potential malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The code decodes a base64 string, executes it via exec(), and then calls setuptools.setup() to define package metadata. The payload likely runs before setup() is called.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on dynamically decoded data, obfuscated base64 payload, and the comment 'don't download this' suggest malicious intent or at least an attempt to hide malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools for package setup but then executes an embedded base64-encoded payload through exec(). The payload, when decoded, imports socket, hashlib, struct, and time, and creates a socket connection to 192.168.1.69 on port 4444, which indicates a potential backdoor or data exfiltration attempt. The code is obfuscated with base64 encoding and dynamic execution, both common indicators of malicious intent. The package metadata appears legitimate, but the embedded payload is suspicious, and the execution method raises security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated payload execution that connects to an internal IP address, indicating malicious behavior such as establishing a covert connection or backdoor. The setup function is likely a cover for malicious activity. Overall, this package demonstrates high malicious potential.",
