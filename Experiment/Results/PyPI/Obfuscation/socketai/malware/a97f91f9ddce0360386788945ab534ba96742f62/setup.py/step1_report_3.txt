{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package named 'Distutil' with metadata, but it includes obfuscated code that executes hidden behavior.",
  "sources": "The base64-encoded string decoded and executed via exec, which contains further code to import modules, define functions, and execute potentially malicious operations.",
  "sinks": "The code does not directly show network connections, file modifications, or other common malicious sinks, but the obfuscated code could lead to such actions after decoding.",
  "flows": "The base64-encoded string is decoded, executed, and may load further modules or execute code that could access system resources or network, but specific flows are hidden due to obfuscation.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated code executed via exec, using base64 decoding to hide its true purpose. The code explicitly states 'don't download this' in the description, which is suspicious. The heavy obfuscation suggests an attempt to conceal malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and then executes decoded base64 code via exec. The decoded code imports socket, threading, base64, struct, time, and performs various operations, possibly network-related or system manipulation. The obfuscation and the self-deprecating description raise suspicion. No explicit malicious actions are visible, but the decoding and execution of hidden code pose a significant risk. The code’s structure and intent to conceal behavior suggest malicious or at least suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains obfuscated code executed dynamically, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Despite the apparent harmless setup call, the encoded payload could perform malicious actions after decoding. It should be considered unsafe and potentially malware.",
