{
  "purpose": "The code decodes a base64-encoded payload and executes it via exec(), which imports modules like socket, ssl, threading, subprocess, indicating potential network and system activity.",
  "sources": "The base64-encoded string decoded and passed to exec()",
  "sinks": "Execution of the decoded code via exec(), leading to network connections, socket operations, or system commands",
  "flows": "Base64 string decoding -> exec() -> imported modules and network/system functions",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with base64 encoding, dynamic execution of decoded code, potential network activity to internal IPs, and import of modules commonly used in malicious payloads",
  "analysis": "The code imports base64 and codecs modules, decodes an obfuscated base64 string, and executes it dynamically. The decoded payload, as identified in reports, imports socket, ssl, threading, subprocess, and performs network connections, including to internal IPs, and may run system commands. The heavy obfuscation and dynamic execution pattern are classic indicators of malicious intent. The code's behavior suggests potential backdoors, data exfiltration, or remote control capabilities. The high obfuscation score (0.9-1.0) and malware score (0.8-0.9) are justified given the evidence. The security risk score (0.9-1.0) is appropriate due to the active network activity and potential for malicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code exhibits high obfuscation and executes a payload that performs network and system operations typical of malicious activity. The high scores assigned in reports are justified. The package should be considered malicious or highly suspicious and should not be used in production environments.",
