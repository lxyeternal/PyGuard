  "purpose": "The code appears to perform data processing, utility functions, or network interactions within a larger project, utilizing sources such as environment variables, user input, or imported modules.",
  "sources": "Input from environment variables, user inputs, external files, network responses, and imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file operations, system commands, or logging mechanisms.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs, environment variables) through processing functions to sinks (network, files, system).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, suspicious functions, or unusual control flow detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with standard data handling and processing patterns. No evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation. The absence of suspicious network activity, hardcoded secrets, or dangerous functions supports a benign assessment. The consistent low scores across reports align with this conclusion. Confidence is high given the descriptions, though limited context prevents absolute certainty.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assessments and scores are consistent and justified based on the provided summaries.",
