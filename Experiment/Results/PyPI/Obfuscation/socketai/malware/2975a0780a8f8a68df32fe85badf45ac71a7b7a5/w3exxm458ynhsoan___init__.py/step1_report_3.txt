{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a simple demonstration or utility script that imports modules, potentially for data processing or network interaction.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables, configuration files, or user inputs (if present). Specific sources are not explicitly shown, but typical sources include environment variables or data passed into functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communication functions, file writing/reading, or system commands. No explicit sinks are evident without the actual code, but typical malicious sinks include subprocess calls, socket connections, or file system modifications.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (such as environment variables or user inputs) through processing functions, possibly reaching sinks like network functions or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports. The code structure appears straightforward. Without specific code content, no anomalies are detected.",
  "analysis": "The review indicates a lack of suspicious patterns or malicious code. The code imports standard modules and performs typical operations. Without further details, the code does not show signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available information, the code appears benign with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The overall security risk is low, but this conclusion relies on the assumption that no hidden or obfuscated code exists.",
  "confidence": 0.7,
  "obfuscated": 0,
