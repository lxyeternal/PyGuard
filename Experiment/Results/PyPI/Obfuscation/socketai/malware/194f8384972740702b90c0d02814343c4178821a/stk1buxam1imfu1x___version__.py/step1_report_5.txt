  "purpose": "This code appears to perform data processing and may include network communication or system modifications, but without explicit context, the primary purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters, environment variables, or imported modules. Specific data sources are not explicitly visible due to lack of code content.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network transmission functions, file system operations, or system commands, but no explicit sink functions are identified in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources through processing functions, possibly reaching sinks such as network or file operations, but specific paths are not clearly delineated due to the absence of code details.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hard-coded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual language features are detected from the provided code. The code structure appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The review is limited by the absence of code content. No suspicious patterns, malicious code, or security risks are evident based on the available information. The code appears to be standard Python, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no clear indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, but a more detailed review with complete code is recommended for definitive assessment.",
