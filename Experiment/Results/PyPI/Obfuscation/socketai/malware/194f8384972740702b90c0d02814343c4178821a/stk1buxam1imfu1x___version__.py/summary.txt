  "conclusion": "Overall, the reports are consistent with the evidence, primarily indicating low risk due to lack of actual code. Report 4's cautious suspicion is justified but does not confirm malicious activity. Slight score adjustments could be made for more conservative estimates, but current scores are reasonable and aligned with the descriptions."
