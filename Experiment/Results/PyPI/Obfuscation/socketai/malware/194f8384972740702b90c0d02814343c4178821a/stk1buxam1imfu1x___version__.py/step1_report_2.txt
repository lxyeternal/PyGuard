  "flows": "No clear data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks is observable in the code.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears minimal or empty, with no identifiable unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is either empty or contains no executable statements, making it impossible to identify malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security issues. No data sources, sinks, or flows are present. The absence of content suggests a non-malicious, benign state, or incomplete code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, there are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks within this code snippet. The code appears benign or uninitialized.",
