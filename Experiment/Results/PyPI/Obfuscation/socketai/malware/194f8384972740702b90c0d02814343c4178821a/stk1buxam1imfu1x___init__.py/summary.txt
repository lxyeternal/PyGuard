  "conclusion": "The code is likely a standard HTTP client with obfuscated internal identifiers. No concrete evidence of malicious behavior is present, and the low malware scores are justified. Obfuscation alone does not confirm malicious intent but should be monitored if source code becomes available. The security risk remains low, and the assessments are appropriate."
