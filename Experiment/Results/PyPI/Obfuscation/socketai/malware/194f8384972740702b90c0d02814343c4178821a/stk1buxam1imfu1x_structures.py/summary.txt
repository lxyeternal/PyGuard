  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated but implements benign data management classes without evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not justify high malware or risk scores. Overall, the code appears safe but should be reviewed in full context for potential hidden logic."
