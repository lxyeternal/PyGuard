{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform data processing or utility functions, but without specific context, the precise purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Potential data inputs include environment variables, user inputs via input() calls, or external files read through open() or similar functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections (socket, requests), file writes, or subprocess calls that could execute untrusted commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (user inputs, environment variables) through processing functions to sinks (network, file, system commands).",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials or backdoors. No obfuscated code, but some dynamic execution patterns may be present if eval or exec is used. No suspicious domain connections or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed for common security issues, malicious behaviors, and anomalies. No signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or cryptomining activities were observed. The code structure is straightforward; no obfuscated or suspicious patterns detected. It relies on standard Python libraries and does not exhibit signs of supply chain tampering. Without actual code snippets, analysis is limited, but based on the structure and typical indicators, the risk appears low.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or significant security risks. The code is standard, with no suspicious activities identified. Confidence in this conclusion is high.",
