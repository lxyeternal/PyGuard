{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up environment-dependent imports, handle Python version differences, and import standard libraries for data handling, URL parsing, and cookies, likely as part of a larger package.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, standard libraries (json, collections, http, io, urllib), and conditional imports based on environment or package availability.",
  "sinks": "None directly evident; no execution of untrusted input, network operations, or sensitive data handling in this fragment.",
  "flows": "Imports and environment checks flow into setting up data types and libraries; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks are observable.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names, dynamic import fallback, and version checks are unusual but not malicious by themselves. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment and dependency setup, including import fallbacks and compatibility adjustments for different Python versions. It defines some type aliases and imports standard libraries without executing external or untrusted code. No suspicious network activity, data leakage, or malicious behavior is detected. Variable obfuscation and dynamic imports may be for obfuscation or compatibility, but do not indicate malicious intent. The absence of network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads suggests a benign intent, likely part of a larger, standard library or framework initialization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard environment setup script with obfuscated variable names and fallback imports. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks in this fragment.",
