{
  "purpose": "The code performs environment compatibility checks, conditional module imports, and defines variables with obfuscated names, serving as setup or configuration code.",
  "sources": "Imports modules such as chardet/charset_normalizer, json/simplejson, and URL parsing functions; reads system version info from sys.version_info.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows are present; no network activity, file writes, or code execution of untrusted input.",
  "flows": "The code primarily sets variables and imports modules without data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names and nonsensical string assignments; no malicious patterns but unusual naming conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code is benign setup code for environment detection and module imports, with no network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior. Variable obfuscation appears superficial and does not indicate malicious intent. No suspicious data flows or code execution are evident. The obfuscation scores are justified by variable naming but do not imply maliciousness. Malware scores are zero, risk scores are very low, and obfuscation scores are moderate to high, consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign environment setup script with obfuscated variable names. No malicious activity or vulnerabilities are detected. The current scores are appropriate and should remain unchanged.",
