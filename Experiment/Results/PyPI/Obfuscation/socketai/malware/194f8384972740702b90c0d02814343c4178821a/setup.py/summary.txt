  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate setup routine with obfuscation and dynamic code execution. No direct malicious activity is evident. The main security concern is the integrity of the '__version__.py' file and the use of exec(). The obfuscation may be an attempt to conceal malicious code but could also be standard obfuscation. Overall, the risk is low, but caution is advised."
