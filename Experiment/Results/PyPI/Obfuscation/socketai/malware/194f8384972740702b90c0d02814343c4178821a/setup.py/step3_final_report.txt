  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, handling version info, dependencies, and publishing commands.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from '__version__.py' via exec(), reads README.md, and processes dependencies.",
  "sinks": "Executes code from external version file, runs system commands for publishing, imports modules like pytest and multiprocessing.",
  "flows": "Source: reading version file -> sink: exec() executes external code; source: command-line args -> sink: os.system() for publishing.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and class names, use of exec() on external file, dynamic system commands, complex code structure.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscation and dynamic execution patterns. The use of exec() on an external version file could execute malicious code if compromised. Obfuscation and dynamic system calls are suspicious but common in such scripts. No evidence of malicious network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors is present. The obfuscation and exec patterns warrant caution but do not confirm malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate setup routine with obfuscation and dynamic code execution. No direct malicious activity is evident. The main security concern is the integrity of the '__version__.py' file and the use of exec(). The obfuscation may be an attempt to conceal malicious code but could also be standard obfuscation. Overall, the risk is low, but caution is advised.",
