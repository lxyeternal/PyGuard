      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate setup routine with obfuscation and dynamic code execution. No direct malicious activity is evident. The main security concern is the integrity of the '__version__.py' file and the use of exec(). The obfuscation may be an attempt to conceal malicious code but could also be standard obfuscation. Overall, the risk is low, but caution is advised."

The anomalies are artifacts of formatting or extraction errors, not malicious obfuscation or payloads. The assigned scores are appropriate and require no adjustment."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign, mainly obfuscated exception class definitions with no malicious activity or security risks detected. The high obfuscation score (0.8) is justified, and the malware score (0) accurately reflects the absence of malicious behavior. The low risk score (0.2) indicates minimal security concern, primarily due to obfuscation, which could be used for concealment but does not imply malicious intent."

Obfuscation warrants further review if source code becomes available, but current analysis indicates low risk."

      "conclusion": "The code is likely a standard HTTP client with obfuscated internal identifiers. No concrete evidence of malicious behavior is present, and the low malware scores are justified. Obfuscation alone does not confirm malicious intent but should be monitored if source code becomes available. The security risk remains low, and the assessments are appropriate."

The obfuscation warrants caution but does not justify high malware or risk scores. Overall, the code appears safe but should be reviewed in full context for potential hidden logic."

      "conclusion": "Overall, the reports are consistent with the evidence, primarily indicating low risk due to lack of actual code. Report 4's cautious suspicion is justified but does not confirm malicious activity. Slight score adjustments could be made for more conservative estimates, but current scores are reasonable and aligned with the descriptions."

Report 3 indicates potential malicious activity based on suspicious patterns, warranting further investigation. The scoring aligns with the described behaviors, with a moderate suspicion level for Report 3. Overall, the assessments are consistent and reasonable."
