  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior, including remote payload download, persistence setup, and execution without validation. It is highly indicative of malware intended for system compromise and remote control. The high scores assigned in the reports (malware 0.9–0.95, risk 0.9–0.95, obfuscation around 0.7) are justified. The overall assessment confirms a high-severity malicious activity requiring immediate attention."
