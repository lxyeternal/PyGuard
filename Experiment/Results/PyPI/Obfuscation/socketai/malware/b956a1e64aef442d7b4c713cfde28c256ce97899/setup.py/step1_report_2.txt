{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, but it contains hidden malicious behavior that downloads and executes remote code, potentially to compromise the system.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from a remote server at IP 145.249.104.71 via HTTP request. It also reads the contents of the user's home directory and potentially executes a script stored there.",
  "sinks": "The script writes a downloaded payload to a file named '.drv' in the user's home directory, modifies its permissions to make it executable, and then executes it. It also appends a command to '.bashrc' to run this script in future sessions, and finally executes the script.",
  "flows": "Remote server response (QOevuhZAUxMCGaDUIiShszNPnsSaYLzU) is written to '.drv', then the script is executed, and a command is added to '.bashrc' to run this script at login.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function name and variable names; unusual code structure; downloading and executing code from a remote server; modifying '.bashrc' to persist execution; using HTTP instead of HTTPS; hiding malicious intent under a setup script; executing code without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The script starts with obfuscated function names and imports. It detects the platform, then retrieves data from a remote IP via HTTP, regardless of the platform. The downloaded data is saved as '.drv' in the user's home directory, with execution permissions set. It then appends a command to '.bashrc' to execute this script at login, and finally executes it immediately. The overall behavior indicates the script is designed to secretly download, install, and persist malicious payloads on the user's system. The code structure and purpose are intentionally obscured to hide malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and exhibits clear malicious behavior, including remote code download, persistence mechanisms, and execution without user consent. It appears designed to compromise the host system, making it dangerous to use.",
