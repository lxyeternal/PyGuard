      "conclusion": "The code is malicious, designed to download, execute, and persist remote code on the target system. It employs obfuscation and persistence techniques typical of supply chain attacks. The overall security risk is extremely high, and the malware score is set to 1.0, reflecting confirmed malicious intent."

      "confidence": 0.95,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior, including remote payload download, persistence setup, and execution without validation. It is highly indicative of malware intended for system compromise and remote control. The high scores assigned in the reports (malware 0.9–0.95, risk 0.9–0.95, obfuscation around 0.7) are justified. The overall assessment confirms a high-severity malicious activity requiring immediate attention."
