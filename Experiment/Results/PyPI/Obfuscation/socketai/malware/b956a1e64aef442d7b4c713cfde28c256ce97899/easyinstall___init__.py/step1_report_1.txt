  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script intended for data processing or utility functions, with no explicit purpose indicated.",
  "sources": "Reads data from input variables, files, or environment variables (if present in code).",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes data to files, outputs to console, or sends data over network connections if present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources through processing functions towards sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious function calls detected. No obfuscated code or unusual language features observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, using common Python constructs. No signs of malicious behavior such as system calls, network connections, or data exfiltration points. No signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads. Lack of external inputs or outputs prevents definitive detection of malicious intent, but nothing suspicious is evident.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign and typical for standard Python scripts.",
