{
  "purpose": "To assess whether the provided Python code dependency contains malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks based on the available reports.",
  "sources": "Input data from code snippets, environment variables, network calls, or file operations (not explicitly provided in the code).",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network transmissions, or execution of untrusted code (not explicitly identified in the code).",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources to sinks, but no suspicious flows are indicated in the reports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious function calls detected.",
  "analysis": "All reports consistently conclude the code is benign with no signs of malware or obfuscation. Scores for malware and obfuscation are zero, with low security risk scores (~0.1-0.2) reflecting minimal concern. Confidence levels are high (0.7-0.9), appropriate given the lack of code details. The assessments align with the descriptions, and no suspicious behaviors are identified. The reports are internally consistent and justify their scores based on the available information.",
  "conclusion": "The code dependency appears safe, with no malicious or obfuscated features detected. The scoring and reasoning across all reports are consistent and justified. No modifications or further investigations are necessary at this stage.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.15,
