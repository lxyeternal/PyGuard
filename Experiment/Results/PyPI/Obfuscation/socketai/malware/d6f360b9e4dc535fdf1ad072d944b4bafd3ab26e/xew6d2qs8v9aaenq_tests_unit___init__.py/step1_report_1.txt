  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not provided or visible; the code may be intended for general functionality such as data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly shown in the provided code snippet; potential sources could include user input, environment variables, or external data files, but none are identified here.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include places where data could be transmitted over a network, written to files, or used in subprocess calls, but no such actions are clearly present in the code snippet.",
  "flows": "No explicit source-to-sink data flows are identified in the visible code; the code appears to perform computations or operations internally without external data propagation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious functions, or unusual code patterns are observed; the code structure appears standard. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution techniques are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard operations without evident malicious intent. It does not include suspicious network activity, credential handling, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The structure and content are typical of benign Python code, with no signs of malware or sabotage. Due to the absence of context or external interactions, a low confidence level is assigned regarding malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with no suspicious patterns or anomalies detected.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0,
