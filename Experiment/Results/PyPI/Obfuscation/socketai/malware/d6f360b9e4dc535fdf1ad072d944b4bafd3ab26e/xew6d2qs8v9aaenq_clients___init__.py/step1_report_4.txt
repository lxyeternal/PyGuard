  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated; it appears to initialize some modules and perform basic operations, possibly for a utility or setup process.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from environment variables, import statements, and possibly from user input or configuration files (if present).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writing, or executing dynamic code, but specific details are missing due to lack of code content.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or inputs into the application's logic, potentially passing through functions or modules that could perform actions like network requests or file access.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present in the visible code. Lack of detailed code limits further analysis.",
  "analysis": "Given the absence of code, the analysis is limited. No suspicious imports, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets are apparent. The code appears to perform standard initialization or utility tasks. Without specific code segments, no malicious patterns or security risks can be identified.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indications of malicious behavior or significant security risks. The code seems benign, but the lack of detailed content limits comprehensive assessment.",
