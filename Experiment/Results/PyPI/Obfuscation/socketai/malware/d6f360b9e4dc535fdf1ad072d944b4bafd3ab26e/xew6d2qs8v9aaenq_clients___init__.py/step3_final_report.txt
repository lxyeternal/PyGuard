  "purpose": "Assess the supply chain security posture of the open source dependency based on provided code review reports, focusing on malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "No actual code provided; analysis based on descriptions, import statements, and high-level summaries.",
  "sinks": "No specific untrusted data sources identified; analysis does not involve data flow evaluation due to lack of code.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no concrete code to trace source-to-sink data flows.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code snippets limits detection; no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed in descriptions.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly note the lack of actual code, relying on high-level descriptions. Scores for malware and obfuscation are consistently zero, justified by the absence of suspicious indicators. Security risk scores are low (~0.2), reflecting minimal concern given the limited information. Confidence levels are appropriate, higher where descriptions are detailed. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are identified. The assessments are cautious and align with the available data, with no evidence supporting malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the limited information, the dependency shows no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation, and the security risk is minimal. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk (~0.2) are justified and consistent across reports. No further action is necessary unless actual code snippets are provided for detailed review.",
