  "conclusion": "The dependency shows minimal malicious activity but contains dynamic code execution features that elevate security risk. The scores are consistent with the analysis, though increasing the malware score slightly for report 4 to 0.3 and the risk to 0.6 would better reflect the potential danger posed by eval/exec. Further static or runtime analysis is recommended before deployment."
