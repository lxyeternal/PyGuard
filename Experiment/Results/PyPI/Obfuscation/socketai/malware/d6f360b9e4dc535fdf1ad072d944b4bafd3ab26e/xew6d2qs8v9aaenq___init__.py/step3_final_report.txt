  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Dynamic code execution points (eval/exec), hardcoded secrets, unusual imports, indirect data handling.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as eval/exec leading to potential malicious actions or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec without input validation, potential obfuscation hints, lack of comments or documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits potential obfuscation and dynamic features, notably eval/exec, which pose security concerns. No explicit malicious payloads are confirmed, but the presence of eval/exec warrants caution. The scores reflect low to moderate suspicion, with the malware score at 0.2 and risk at 0.55 for dynamic execution. Obfuscation suspicion is moderate (0.3). Overall, the code appears mostly benign but with red flags that justify further review.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency shows minimal malicious activity but contains dynamic code execution features that elevate security risk. The scores are consistent with the analysis, though increasing the malware score slightly for report 4 to 0.3 and the risk to 0.6 would better reflect the potential danger posed by eval/exec. Further static or runtime analysis is recommended before deployment.",
