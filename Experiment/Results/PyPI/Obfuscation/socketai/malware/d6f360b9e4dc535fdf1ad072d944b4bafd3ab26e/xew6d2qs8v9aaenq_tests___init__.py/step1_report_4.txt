  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be a Python package component, possibly related to data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters, environment variables, and potentially external modules or libraries invoked within the code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, file writes, or database queries if present, but none are explicitly shown in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from inputs (parameters/env variables) through various functions and possibly to output or side-effects like logging or data storage.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be straightforward, using standard Python constructs and libraries. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks are evident. The code does not include network connections, secret handling, or obfuscated parts. It performs expected functions without dangerous side-effects.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there are no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code seems benign, with no suspicious or malicious activities detected.",
