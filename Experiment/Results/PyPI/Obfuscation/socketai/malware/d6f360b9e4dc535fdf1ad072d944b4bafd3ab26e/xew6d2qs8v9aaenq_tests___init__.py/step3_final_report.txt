  "anomalies": "Obfuscation, eval/exec usage, hardcoded secrets, complex/redundant code, signs of dynamic code execution without clear purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution (eval/exec), which are common indicators of potential malicious intent. No concrete evidence of malicious actions such as data exfiltration, system damage, or network communication was observed. The use of eval and obfuscation warrants caution, increasing the suspicion level but not confirming malicious activity. The code's benign appearance in straightforward cases aligns with low malware likelihood. The scores assigned in the reports generally reflect these observations, with higher obfuscation scores where code is heavily obfuscated and low malware scores due to lack of direct malicious actions. Slight adjustments are recommended: increasing the malware suspicion in report 1 from 0.2 to 0.3 to account for eval and obfuscation concerns, while maintaining other scores consistent with the evidence.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, raising suspicion but lacking direct malicious activity. The current scores are appropriate, with a slight increase in malware suspicion for report 1 justified by eval usage. Overall, the supply chain risk remains moderate, primarily due to obfuscation and eval, but no confirmed malware is present.",
