  "conclusion": "The code shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, raising suspicion but lacking direct malicious activity. The current scores are appropriate, with a slight increase in malware suspicion for report 1 justified by eval usage. Overall, the supply chain risk remains moderate, primarily due to obfuscation and eval, but no confirmed malware is present."
