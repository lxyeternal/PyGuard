  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious exfiltration behavior during package setup, indicating high risk and malicious potential. The current scores in the reports are mostly justified, but the malware scores, especially for reports 2 and 5, should be increased to better reflect the severity. Overall, this behavior should be flagged as malicious, with high malware and security risk scores."
