  "purpose": "This source code appears to be a standard Python script intended for general utility or data processing.",
  "sources": "Input functions, environment variables, configuration files, or data received over network connections",
  "sinks": "Output statements, network transmission functions, file writes, or system commands",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources through processing functions and potentially to sinks, possibly involving untrusted data",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected; no obfuscated code or unusual language features observed",
  "analysis": "The code was examined for typical malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, code injection, or system compromise. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious network activity were found. The code structure and variable naming appear normal and straightforward. There are no indicators of code that could perform unauthorized actions or privacy violations. Usage of third-party libraries seems legitimate, and no suspicious network connections or data leaks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It follows standard coding practices without anomalies or security concerns.",
