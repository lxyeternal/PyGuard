  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for data processing or utility functions, but without specific context, the exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Potential sources include reading environment variables, configuration files, or user inputs; however, no explicit input sources are visible in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are functions that could execute system commands, write to files, or send data over the network, but no such sinks are explicitly shown.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks is evident in the provided code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code constructs, such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or dynamic execution, are present. The code is straightforward and uses common libraries and patterns.",
  "analysis": "A detailed review shows standard use of Python functions, no malicious payloads, and no suspicious behaviors. The code structure and content do not indicate any malware, backdoors, or security risks. The absence of external input handling or insecure operations suggests low risk.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears benign, with no suspicious or malicious behaviors detected.",
