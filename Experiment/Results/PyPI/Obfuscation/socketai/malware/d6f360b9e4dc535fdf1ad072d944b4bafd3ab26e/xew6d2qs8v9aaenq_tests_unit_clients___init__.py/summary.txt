  "conclusion": "The supply chain security reports are generally accurate, indicating low malicious activity. Slightly increasing the malware score in Report 4 to 0.3 would better capture the potential risks posed by dynamic features. The rest of the assessments are appropriate, and the low overall risk reflects the benign nature of the code snippets."
