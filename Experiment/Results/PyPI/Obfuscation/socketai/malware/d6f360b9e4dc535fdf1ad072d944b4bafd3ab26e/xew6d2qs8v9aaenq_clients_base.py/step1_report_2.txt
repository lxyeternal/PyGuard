{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for sending events with validation and logging",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as event_type, event_data, timestamp, logger, and optional method parameters",
  "sinks": "Logging output, potential data handling in _send_event (not implemented here)",
  "flows": "Input parameters are validated, then passed to _send_event, with logs generated during process",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious data handling observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class with methods for validating event type and timestamp, and for sending events with logging. The send_event method handles input validation and logging, then calls an abstract method. There are no signs of data leakage, malicious data handling, or suspicious external interactions. It uses standard libraries and practices. No obfuscated or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured base class for event handling. No malicious or suspicious behavior observed, and no security risks evident from the provided snippet.",
