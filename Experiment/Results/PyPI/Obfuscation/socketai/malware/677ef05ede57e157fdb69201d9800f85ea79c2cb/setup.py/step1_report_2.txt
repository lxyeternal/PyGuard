{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be a setup script for a Python package, but it also includes code to execute a PowerShell command which may be malicious.",
  "sources": "The code reads the file system (os.path.exists) and executes a PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen executes a command that could perform malicious actions, such as downloading or executing remote code.",
  "flows": "The script checks for a directory 'tahg' and if not found, executes a hidden PowerShell command; the setup function runs normally after.",
  "anomalies": "Use of encoded PowerShell command with 'powershell -EncodedCommand', which is often used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The code runs a PowerShell command without validation or clear purpose.",
  "analysis": "The script first attempts to run a hidden PowerShell command encoded in base64, which is suspicious as obfuscation technique. It does so if the directory 'tahg' does not exist. The command is encoded and potentially malicious. The setup configuration appears normal but is possibly used to disguise or facilitate malicious activity. The try-except blocks suppress errors, which could hide malicious failures. Overall, the code contains obfuscated code execution with no clear benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes obfuscated PowerShell execution triggered conditionally, indicating potentially malicious behavior designed to run hidden commands during setup. The benign appearance of the setup function is likely a cover for malicious intent. The overall risk is high due to obfuscated code execution and suspicious command usage.",
