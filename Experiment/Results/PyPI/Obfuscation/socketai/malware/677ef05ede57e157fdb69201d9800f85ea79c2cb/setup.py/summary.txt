  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious indicators through obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during setup. The pattern is consistent with malware or backdoor activity. Scores of malware (~0.85), obfuscation (~0.9), and security risk (~0.9) are justified given the evidence. It should be treated as malicious until further payload analysis confirms benign intent."
