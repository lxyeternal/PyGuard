{
  "purpose": "Initialize the easygetflag package and import a specific class or function from a local module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a relative module; reading of the string '1.4'.",
  "sinks": "Print statement (though harmless), no untrusted data sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Import source flows into potential code execution or further use; string assignment is straightforward and not used further.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual import name: the class/function name appears as a random string, which may suggest obfuscation or a non-standard naming convention. The code is minimal but could be part of a larger, obfuscated package.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific object from a local module with a non-descriptive name. It then assigns a version string to a variable and prints a message. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity, data leakage, or hidden payloads. The import name and minimal content could be suspicious if part of a larger obfuscated codebase, but based solely on this fragment, no malicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, performing simple import and print operations. The unusual import name might indicate obfuscation but does not in itself suggest malicious intent. No security risks or malware are detected in this snippet.",
