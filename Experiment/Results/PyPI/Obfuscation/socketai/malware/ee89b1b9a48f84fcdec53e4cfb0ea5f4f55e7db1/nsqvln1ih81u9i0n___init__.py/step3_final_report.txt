{
  "purpose": "This code imports an obfuscated symbol from a local module, assigns a version string, and prints an initialization message.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .module, reading the symbol TnqnBgdifOpnOAZIgvlxINlfDtZzLKNu; the string assignment to JEqqWCNYaIPkxGeNIADAklUoUrhdJxtb; the print statement.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows are present; the code does not perform network, file, or environment variable operations.",
  "flows": "The import source feeds into the module namespace; the version string is assigned but unused; the print statement outputs to stdout. No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated import and variable names; the version string is assigned but not used; minimal code with no functional behavior beyond printing.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a symbol with an obfuscated name from a local module, assigns a version string that is unused, and prints a message. There is no network activity, data leakage, or malicious code. The obfuscated import suggests possible code hiding but does not imply malicious intent. The scores reflect suspicion of obfuscation but no evidence of malicious behavior. Malware score is zero; obfuscation score is moderate; security risk is low. The code appears benign, with obfuscation being the main suspicious aspect.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign in its current form. The obfuscated import name warrants caution but does not indicate malicious activity. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident. Further review of the actual module source is recommended if obfuscation persists in the larger context.",
