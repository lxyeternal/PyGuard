{
  "purpose": "The code appears to initialize a package or module and print a message indicating the start of a process, likely related to 'easygetflag'.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports a class or function from a local module and uses a hardcoded string variable.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write to files, network, or perform any data leak or insecure operation.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the import and print statements do not process external input or produce outputs affecting security.",
  "anomalies": "The imported symbol has an obfuscated or random name, but this alone is not suspicious. The string '1.4' is hardcoded but not malicious. No signs of code injection, backdoors, or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a symbol with an obfuscated name, likely to hide functionality, but this is common in some packages. It defines a version string '1.4' and prints a message. There are no network connections, no credential handling, and no malicious behavior evident. The import could be part of normal package setup or obfuscation but is not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal, primarily for package initialization and status output, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The obfuscated import is not unusual but warrants context review if part of a larger suspicious package.",
