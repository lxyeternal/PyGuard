{
  "purpose": "The code appears to initialize a package and import a specific class or function from a local module.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .module, and the hardcoded string '1.4'.",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs to standard output, which is generally benign. No other sinks like network, file, or environment variable modifications are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the import statement and the string assignment to the output via print. No untrusted data sources or malicious flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The import source is an obscure, unnamed module, which might indicate obfuscation or non-standard code structure. The imported name is an unreadable, possibly obfuscated identifier. The string '1.4' is hardcoded but appears harmless.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a symbol with a complex, obfuscated name from a local module, which could be an attempt to hide malicious intent. The assignment of '1.4' to a variable has no apparent malicious use. The print statement is benign. There are no network connections, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors evident. Overall, the code seems to serve as a minimal, possibly obfuscated, initialization script with no clear malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal and potentially obfuscated, but does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet. The obscure import could be a sign of obfuscation, but there's no evidence of malicious activity.",
