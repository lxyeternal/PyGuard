{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom setup process that, during installation, attempts to establish a reverse shell connection to a remote server.",
  "sources": "The code reads network address and port data from base64-encoded strings, and creates socket connections to external IP address and port.",
  "sinks": "The socket connection and subprocess call are used to establish a reverse shell, which allows remote code execution on the host machine.",
  "flows": "The code decodes the IP and port, then uses socket to connect and redirects I/O to spawn a shell, effectively granting remote access if successful.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and function names, base64-encoded IP address and port, reverse shell behavior, and the connection attempt during installation are suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code includes a class that extends setuptools' install command, overriding the install method to execute a reverse shell upon installation. It decodes an IP address ('49.233.121.53') and port ('54') from base64, then attempts to connect via socket. If successful, it redirects standard input, output, and error streams to this socket and spawns a shell, allowing remote control. The connection and shell spawning are wrapped in exception handling, which simply logs errors. The package metadata indicates a benign package name, but the embedded code's behavior is malicious, aiming for remote access.\n\nThis behavior constitutes a clear security threat: it installs a backdoor that could be exploited for unauthorized remote access. The code runs automatically during installation, which is unusual and suspicious, and is indicative of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains malicious code that attempts to establish a reverse shell connection during installation. It decodes target IP and port from base64, then creates a socket connection to facilitate remote access, representing a significant security threat. The obfuscation of functions and the execution during setup suggest deliberate malicious intent.",
