{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package installation process, but it includes malicious code intended to establish a reverse shell connection to an external server during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded base64-encoded IP address and port, socket creation, and subprocess call for shell access. It also reads the decoded IP and port during the reverse shell connection attempt.",
  "sinks": "The socket connection, os.dup2 calls, and subprocess.call(['/bin/sh', '-i']) allow remote command execution, which can lead to system control or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "During the installation, the code decodes base64 IP and port, attempts to connect to the external server, duplicates socket file descriptors to standard input/output/error, and opens an interactive shell, providing remote access to the attacker.",
  "anomalies": "The class name and method names are obfuscated and nonsensical, possibly to evade detection. The socket connection and reverse shell are embedded within the setup process, which is unusual and suspicious. Hardcoded IP and port are used in the network activity. The code imports unnecessary modules like subprocess and socket specifically for malicious purposes.",
  "analysis": "The script modifies the installation process to include a backdoor that connects to an external server at 49.233.121.53:54. After decoding the IP and port from base64, it attempts to establish a socket connection and then redirects the process's input/output streams to this socket. This enables remote command execution via a reverse shell. The obfuscated class and method names suggest an attempt to conceal malicious intent. The use of the subprocess call with '/bin/sh' confirms remote shell access. Overall, the code is designed to secretly establish remote control over the system during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains malicious code embedded within the setup script to establish a reverse shell connection, enabling remote control of the affected system. The obfuscation and hardcoded network details indicate malicious intent. The code poses a high security risk if installed.",
