{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package that includes an embedded malicious backdoor for remote access.",
  "sources": "The function HWjzsLGjdqdZeGsplJjKsdfLwnftYaBc reads a base64-encoded IP address and port, which are then used to establish a network connection.",
  "sinks": "The socket connection is used as a sink, redirecting the socket to stdin, stdout, and stderr, and spawning a shell, enabling remote command execution.",
  "flows": "The code decodes IP and port, creates a socket connection to the specified address, duplicates socket file descriptors to standard input/output/error, and then executes a shell, creating a reverse shell.",
  "anomalies": "The class name and method names are obfuscated and do not follow standard naming conventions. The connection details are base64-encoded, hiding malicious intent. The socket connection and shell invocation are embedded within a package setup process, which is unusual and suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of setuptools' install command that attempts to establish a reverse shell connection during package installation. The IP address (49.233.121.53) and port (84) are base64-decoded, then used to connect back to the attacker-controlled server. The socket's file descriptors are duplicated to stdin, stdout, and stderr, and a subprocess shell is invoked, effectively giving remote control of the host. The obfuscation and embedding of malicious network behavior within a setup script strongly suggest malicious intent, likely intended for unauthorized remote access and control.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains a malicious backdoor that establishes a reverse shell to a remote server during package installation, indicating high malicious intent. The obfuscation, unusual coding patterns, and integration within setup routines confirm this as malicious behavior.",
