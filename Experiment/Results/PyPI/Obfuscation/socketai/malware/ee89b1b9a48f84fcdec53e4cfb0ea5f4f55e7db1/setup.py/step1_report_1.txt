{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package, but includes malicious code that attempts to establish a reverse shell connection to a remote server during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from base64-encoded strings, socket connections, and environment variables (via socket connection and subprocess). It also uses subprocess to execute a shell command.",
  "sinks": "The socket connection and subprocess call serve as sinks, which could be used to establish remote access or execute arbitrary commands on the system.",
  "flows": "The code decodes hardcoded IP and port, establishes a socket connection to the remote host, duplicates socket file descriptors to standard input/output/error, and executes a shell, creating a reverse shell from the infected machine to the remote server.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded IP address and port, obfuscated class and function names, network activity during package installation, use of socket and subprocess for reverse shell, base64-encoded strings, unusual class and method names with no apparent purpose outside malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom install command class that, during package installation, attempts to connect back to an external server (49.233.121.53:54). It decodes an IP address and port from base64 strings, then creates a socket connection. Upon success, it duplicates socket file descriptors to standard input, output, and error, then spawns an interactive shell, effectively creating a reverse shell. This behavior is malicious, enabling remote control of the compromised system. The obfuscated class and function names are likely designed to evade detection. The code executes only during installation, which is highly suspicious. No benign purpose justifies this activity in a setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains clear malicious behavior, establishing a reverse shell to a remote server during package installation. It uses obfuscation and hardcoded data to hide its intent. This code poses a high security risk and is highly suspicious.",
