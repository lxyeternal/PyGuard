{
  "purpose": "The code appears to modify the installation process of a Python package, with a hidden mechanism to establish a reverse shell connection to a specified IP address and port.",
  "sources": "The function HWjzsLGjdqdZeGsplJjKsdfLwnftYaBc reads hardcoded base64-encoded IP address and port, which are decoded and used for network connection.",
  "sinks": "Socket connection in HWjzsLGjdqdZeGsplJjKsdfLwnftYaBc establishes a reverse shell by connecting to a remote host, then redirects stdin, stdout, and stderr to the socket, and executes a shell.",
  "flows": "The install process triggers the method sksWXUGzSQnfLabQnSQlmQgtutqAXSsK, which calls HWjzsLGjdqdZeGsplJjKsdfLwnftYaBc with hardcoded IP and port, leading to a reverse shell setup during package installation.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and function names, base64-encoded IP and port, and the reverse shell logic embedded inside the installation process are suspicious behaviors. The code does not log or warn about its network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that overrides the install method. During installation, it attempts to connect back to a remote server (49.233.121.53:54), decoding these from base64 strings, indicating hardcoded malicious intent. If the connection succeeds, it sets up a reverse shell by redirecting process I/O streams to the socket and launches an interactive shell. The purpose appears to be remote code execution and potential system compromise during package installation. The code is intentionally obfuscated with non-descriptive class and function names, and includes an embedded reverse shell mechanism that activates during the install process.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains malicious code designed to establish a reverse shell connection to a remote server during installation, enabling remote control of the host system. The obfuscation, hardcoded network details, and embedded shell access point to high malicious intent. The package should be considered dangerous and should not be used.",
