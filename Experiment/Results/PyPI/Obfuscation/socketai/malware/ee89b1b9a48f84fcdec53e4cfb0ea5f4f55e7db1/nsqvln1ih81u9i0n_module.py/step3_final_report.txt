  "purpose": "A simple Python function that prints a greeting message.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources; static code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no external communication or data leakage points.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; static print statement.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function name; no suspicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function with an obfuscated name that prints a static message. There are no external inputs, no network activity, no data processing, and no suspicious behavior. The obfuscated name suggests an attempt to hide intent, but the function's behavior is benign. Malware score is 0, security risk is very low (~0.1), and confidence in benign assessment is high (~0.9).",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious activity detected. The obfuscated name is a minor concern but does not indicate malicious intent. The overall security risk is negligible.",
