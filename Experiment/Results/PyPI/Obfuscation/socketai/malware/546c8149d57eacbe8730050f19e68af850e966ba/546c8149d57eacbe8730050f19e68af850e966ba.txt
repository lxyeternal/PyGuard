      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation and performs system-level modifications, package management, and privilege escalation, indicating malicious behavior. It should be considered malicious and unsafe. The high obfuscation, combined with system manipulation, warrants a malware score of 0.9, obfuscation score of 0.9, and security risk score of 0.9."

      "conclusion": "The reports are generally accurate and well-reasoned. The only recommended change is to reduce Report 3's malware score from 0.3 to 0.2 to align with the absence of confirmed malicious activity. The overall security posture remains low risk, with cautious suspicion in obfuscated code. Final adjusted scores: malware=0.2, obfuscated=0.8, securityRisk=0.4, confidence=0.7."
