  "purpose": "Obfuscated setup script with conditional logic, system modifications, package installation, and potential malicious activities.",
  "sources": "sys.platform, sys.argv, environment variables (os.getenv), os.path.exists, os.walk, ctypes.windll.shell32, os, Dispatch module, os.environ, file operations, system privilege checks.",
  "sinks": "pip.main(), os.makedirs(), os.path.expanduser(), os.path.exists(), os.remove(), file write operations, creating shortcuts via Dispatch, privilege escalation via ctypes.windll.shell32.IsUserAnAdmin(), os.system calls, os.path.exists, os.mkdir, os.rmdir.",
  "flows": "Input from sys.argv, environment variables, and system checks influence conditional branches leading to package installation, file system modifications, privilege escalation, shortcut creation, and system privilege checks.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation through dynamic string assembly, complex bitwise and shift operations, meaningless variable names, multiple conditional branches based on obscure calculations, use of system-specific modules, potential for privilege escalation, backdoor setup, or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code is heavily obfuscated, making static analysis difficult. It performs conditional actions based on command-line arguments and environment variables, often executing system modifications, package installations, shortcut creation, and privilege escalation. The use of dynamic string generation and convoluted calculations indicates an intent to evade detection. The presence of system privilege checks, file manipulations, and potential privilege escalation points strongly suggest malicious intent, such as backdoor installation or system compromise.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation and performs system-level modifications, package management, and privilege escalation, indicating malicious behavior. It should be considered malicious and unsafe. The high obfuscation, combined with system manipulation, warrants a malware score of 0.9, obfuscation score of 0.9, and security risk score of 0.9.",
