  "purpose": "Obfuscated conditional logic and dynamic execution potentially related to package setup or malicious activity.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, sys.argv input, and file system operations like open, os.getenv, os.makedirs, os.path.exists, os.path.expanduser, os.path.basename, os.path.isdir, and os.write.",
  "sinks": "Calls pip.main() (potential package installation), os.makedirs(), os.path.expanduser(), os.path.exists(), os.path.isdir(), os.write(), and os.remove(), which can modify the file system or execute code.",
  "flows": "Input from sys.argv or environment variables flows into conditional branches, some of which execute system or package management commands (pip, os.system, os.makedirs, os.write, os.remove). Obfuscated code dynamically constructs strings used in these operations. Nested loops and conditional checks control the execution flow, often based on obscure numerical conditions.",
  "anomalies": "Extensive use of obfuscated and complex bitwise, shifting, and string manipulations to dynamically construct method names, file paths, and commands. Use of obfuscated variable names (e.g., 馬女水女口目人馬鳥月水馬山山馬鸟) and meaningless calculations. Conditional branches trigger potentially dangerous operations like system modifications and file handling. The code appears deliberately complex to hide malicious intent or obscure real operations.",
  "analysis": "The code employs heavy obfuscation through convoluted calculations, dynamic string assembly, and obscure variable names, making static analysis challenging. Multiple conditional branches based on intricate numerical checks determine whether to execute system commands, modify files, or install packages via pip. Certain branches invoke system-level operations such as creating shortcuts, running Windows admin checks, or modifying filesystem paths, possibly to install or execute malicious payloads. The code constructs commands or file paths from encoded parts, likely to hide its true intent. The final setup() call with a generic package name and version appears benign but is likely a cover for malicious activities masked by the obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This script exhibits high obfuscation and complex control flows designed to conceal malicious behavior. It performs system modifications, potentially installs packages or executes code, and manipulates files based on obscure conditions. The heavy use of string manipulation, environment variables, and conditional logic indicates malicious intent masked by deliberate complexity. The overall security risk is high; this package should not be used or trusted.",
