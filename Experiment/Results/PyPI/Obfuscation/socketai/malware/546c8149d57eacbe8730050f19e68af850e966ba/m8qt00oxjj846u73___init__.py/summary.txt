  "conclusion": "The reports are generally accurate and well-reasoned. The only recommended change is to reduce Report 3's malware score from 0.3 to 0.2 to align with the absence of confirmed malicious activity. The overall security posture remains low risk, with cautious suspicion in obfuscated code. Final adjusted scores: malware=0.2, obfuscated=0.8, securityRisk=0.4, confidence=0.7."
