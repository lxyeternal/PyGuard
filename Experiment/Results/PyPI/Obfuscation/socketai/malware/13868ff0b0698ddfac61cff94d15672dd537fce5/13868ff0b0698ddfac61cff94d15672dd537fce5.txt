      "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious, potentially malicious behavior through obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during setup, with error suppression and stealth flags. The high obfuscation and stealth tactics justify high malware and security risk scores. While the exact payload remains unverified, the indicators strongly suggest malicious intent, making this package potentially dangerous. Further decoding of the PowerShell command is recommended to confirm malicious payloads."
