  "conclusion": "The code is primarily safe, serving as documentation for Python typing features. The embedded variable assignments in report 2 are suspicious and could indicate obfuscation or hidden markers but do not constitute active malware. Overall, the security risk is very low, but further review of embedded anomalies is recommended if part of a larger codebase."
