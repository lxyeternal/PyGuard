  "purpose": "Define generic classes and variables with conditional syntax based on Python version, involving type annotations and nested classes.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, dedent string executed via exec, class attribute annotations, and module-level variables.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted input handling or external data output observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; code mainly defines type annotations and class structures.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec with dedented code, which can potentially execute arbitrary code if the input is manipulated, though here it appears static. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic are present. The dynamic execution for version-specific syntax is a potential concern, but in this context, it seems intended for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally executes a block of code with exec() for Python >= 3.6, defining optional variables and generic classes with type annotations, including nested classes. For older Python versions, it assigns annotations and variables directly. No external data inputs or outputs are processed. The exec() usage could be a security concern if the code string were dynamic or untrusted, but here it appears static and controlled. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful system operations. The code is mainly for type hinting and class structure definition, typical in type-annotated modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. Its use of exec() is limited to version-specific compatibility and does not introduce known malicious patterns. No suspicious data flows or embedded malware indicators are present.",
