{
  "purpose": "Define generic classes and variables with conditional syntax based on Python version, primarily for testing or compatibility.",
  "sources": "Code reads input from sys.version_info, defines classes and variables via exec() or direct assignment, and sets type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No external data sources, network operations, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Version check leads to execution of static code defining classes and variables; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() with static, dedented string for compatibility; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs a controlled, static exec() for version compatibility, defining generic classes with annotations. No external inputs, network activity, or data leaks are present. The use of exec() is safe here, serving only to define types conditionally. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious data flows are evident. The code is benign and primarily for testing or compatibility purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, with no malicious intent or malicious behavior. The use of exec() is controlled and for compatibility, not malicious. The overall security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscation scores are zero.",
