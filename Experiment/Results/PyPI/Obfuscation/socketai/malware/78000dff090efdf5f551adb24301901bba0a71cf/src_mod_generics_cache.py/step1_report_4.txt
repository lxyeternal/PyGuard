{
  "purpose": "Define generic classes A and B with internal annotations for testing generic behavior across modules.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, the exec(dedent()) block, class attribute annotations, type variables, and potential external interactions through get_type_hints.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; no untrusted data handling or output operations are present.",
  "flows": "Code flow primarily involves defining types and annotations; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() with dedent() containing code that defines type annotations dynamically. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally executes a string of Python code that defines type annotations and classes with generic parameters. This dynamic execution is safe as it only defines types and variables. No external inputs, network calls, or sensitive data handling are present. The purpose appears to be for testing generic type behavior across modules. The structure and content do not show any malicious activity or obfuscation. The code avoids unsafe practices such as executing untrusted code from external sources. Overall, it is a standard test setup for type annotations and generics, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, intentionally designed module for testing generics and annotations. It uses dynamic execution solely for defining test classes and variables. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
