{
  "purpose": "Define generic classes A and B with some nested structures and optional default instances for testing generics across modules.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info for Python version check; exec(dedent(...)) for dynamic code execution; class attribute annotations and initializations.",
  "sinks": "No obvious sinks that process untrusted input or perform sensitive operations such as network communication, file access, or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Conditional execution based on Python version; dynamic execution of code that sets class annotations and variables.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec with dedent to dynamically define classes and variables; presence of string annotations that could be processed dynamically; no explicit input sources or data handling suspicious in context.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally executes a block of code that defines optional default variables, type variables, and nested generic classes with annotations. The dynamic exec executes a string of Python code with class definitions and variable assignments. The annotations are strings, which might be processed later with get_type_hints or similar. There are no external inputs, no data being sent over network, nor any file operations, nor any code that performs data leakage or system modification. The dynamic code is confined to type definitions and initializations, which are typical in type hinting and generic class setups. No evidence of obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious behavior was found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, self-contained module defining generic classes and optional defaults, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The use of exec is limited to class definitions and does not introduce malicious behavior in this context.",
