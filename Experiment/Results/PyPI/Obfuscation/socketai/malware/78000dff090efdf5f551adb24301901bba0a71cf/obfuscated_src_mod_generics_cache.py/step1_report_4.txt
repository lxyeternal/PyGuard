  "purpose": "Defines generic classes A and B with some attributes and type annotations, possibly for type hinting or class relationships.",
  "sources": "Type annotations, class definitions, and variable assignments",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data processing, I/O, or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; mainly static type definitions and class structure",
  "anomalies": "Use of string-based forward references in type annotations, no evidence of code execution or data leaks",
  "analysis": "The code defines two generic classes A and B with some class attributes. It employs forward references ('A', 'B.A') and type variables, which are typical in generic class definitions for type hinting. There are no functions, data processing, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets, malicious imports, or suspicious code constructs are present. The structure appears to be purely for type annotations and class relationships. No source-to-sink data flow or potential malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static type annotation setup involving generic classes and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be standard for type hinting in Python with no evidence of sabotage, malware, or security vulnerabilities.",
