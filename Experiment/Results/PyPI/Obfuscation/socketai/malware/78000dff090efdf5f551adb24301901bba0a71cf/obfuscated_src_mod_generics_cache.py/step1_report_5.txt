  "purpose": "Define generic classes A and B with type parameters, and declare some class attributes with optional and type annotations.",
  "sources": "Type annotations and class attribute declarations.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data input or output points.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; primarily static type annotations and class structures.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. The nested class structure is somewhat complex but not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines generic classes with type parameters, including nested classes and class attributes annotated with types referencing other classes. There are no functions, no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious constructs. The structure appears to be for type hinting or modeling relationships between classes. No signs of malicious intent or malicious code patterns are present. The complexity of nested classes is typical for advanced type annotations but not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a standard complex type annotation setup with nested classes and generic parameters. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, security risks, or supply chain attacks in this snippet.",
