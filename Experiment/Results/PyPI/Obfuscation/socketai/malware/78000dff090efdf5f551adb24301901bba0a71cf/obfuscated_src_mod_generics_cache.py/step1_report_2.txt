{
  "purpose": "Define generic classes A and B with nested class and type annotations, possibly for type hinting or structural modeling.",
  "sources": "Type annotations for 'A', 'B', 'default_a', 'default_b', and class attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed; mainly type definitions and class annotations.",
  "flows": "Type annotations and class attributes suggest flow of type information but no runtime data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected. The nested class structure and self-referential annotations are complex but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines generic classes A and B with type parameters. 'A' has an attribute 'some_b' of type 'B'. 'B' contains a nested class 'A' and attributes referencing instances of 'B.A', the outer 'A', and the inner class. There are no executable statements, input handling, or data transmission. The code appears to be intended for type hinting or structural modeling, with complex self-references that could be used for advanced type checks. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a static type structure definition with nested classes and annotations, exhibiting no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
