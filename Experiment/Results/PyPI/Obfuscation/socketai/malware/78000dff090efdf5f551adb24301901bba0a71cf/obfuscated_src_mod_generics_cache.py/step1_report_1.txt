  "purpose": "Define generic classes A and B with nested structures and optional attributes.",
  "sources": "None explicitly; no input reading operations are present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data outputs identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is primarily class and type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual nested class definitions and use of string annotations could suggest obfuscation, but are valid Python type hints.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions with generics and type annotations, including nested classes and optional attributes. No external input, data processing, or untrusted data handling is present. The code appears to be standard type hinting and class structure for type checking purposes. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors are observed. The structure is somewhat complex but aligns with typical advanced typing patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of class definitions using Python generics and type annotations with nested classes, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be for type checking or design purposes only.",
