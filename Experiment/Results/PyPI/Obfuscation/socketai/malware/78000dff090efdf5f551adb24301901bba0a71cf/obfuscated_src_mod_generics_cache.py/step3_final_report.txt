{
  "purpose": "The code defines static class attributes, generic classes with nested classes, and forward references for type hinting and structural modeling purposes.",
  "sources": "Class attribute definitions, type variable declaration, nested class declarations, string annotations for forward references.",
  "sinks": "No data input/output, external data sources, or runtime data flows; no untrusted data handling or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "None; the code consists solely of static class/type annotations with no data flow or runtime logic.",
  "anomalies": "Use of complex nested classes and string annotations for forward references, which are advanced type hinting techniques but not suspicious or malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code employs static class attributes, generic classes, nested classes, and string annotations for forward references, all typical in complex type hinting. There are no functions, data processing, external data handling, or runtime behaviors. The structure is purely for type annotations or modeling, with no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The use of nested classes and string annotations, while complex, is standard in advanced typing scenarios and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended solely for static type hinting and structural purposes. No malicious activity, data leaks, or obfuscation are present. The assigned malware score of 0 and low security risk score (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's static, non-executable nature.",
