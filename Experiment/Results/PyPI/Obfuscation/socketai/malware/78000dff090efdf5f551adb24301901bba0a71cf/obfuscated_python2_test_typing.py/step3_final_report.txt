  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code reading input data, environment variables, network calls, subprocess executions, dynamic code execution (eval/exec).",
  "sinks": "Network transmission, file operations, environment variable access, subprocess calls, potential data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or user input flow into network or file sinks; dynamic code execution may process untrusted data from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval/exec, hardcoded IPs/credentials, obfuscation, complex control flow, suspicious data handling, dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "Most reports indicate benign code with no suspicious activity, consistent low malware and obfuscation scores, and low security risk. Report 2 exhibits high suspicion due to eval/exec, obfuscation, and suspicious data handling, justified by high malware (0.65-0.7), obfuscation (0.7), and risk (0.75) scores. Other reports are straightforward and benign, with scores reflecting their descriptions. Overall, the scores align with the behaviors described, with the notable exception of report 2's suspicion, which is well justified.",
  "conclusion": "The majority of the code appears benign, with one report indicating potential malicious activity justified by suspicious features. The scoring is appropriate and consistent with the analysis, with a malware score around 0.2-0.3 overall, and higher for report 2. No further adjustments necessary.",
