{
  "purpose": "The code appears to initialize a simple command-line utility that processes user input and performs calculations or actions based on provided arguments.",
  "sources": "Input sources include command-line arguments via sys.argv and potentially environment variables or user input prompts.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, file operations, or network requests if present later in the code, but none are explicitly shown in the provided fragment.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user input (command-line arguments) through processing functions, potentially influencing system state or output. No direct evidence of untrusted data affecting critical operations in the fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior is evident. No dynamic code execution, suspicious external calls, or data leaks are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, initializing variables based on command-line arguments, performing calculations, and printing results. No malicious patterns, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are present. Usage of standard libraries and simple control flow suggests benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code fragment, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a benign utility with standard operations.",
