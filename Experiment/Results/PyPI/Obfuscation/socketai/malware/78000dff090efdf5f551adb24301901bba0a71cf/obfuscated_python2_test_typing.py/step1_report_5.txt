  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are visible. The code appears straightforward and typical.",
  "analysis": "Step-by-step analysis shows that the code is a standard Python script with no signs of malicious or suspicious activity. There are no unusual language features, dynamic execution, or hidden behaviors. Usage of third-party libraries is not inherently suspicious. Without more context or code, no malicious intent can be inferred.",
