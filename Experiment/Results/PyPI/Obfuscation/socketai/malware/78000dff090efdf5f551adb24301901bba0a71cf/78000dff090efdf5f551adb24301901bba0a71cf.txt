Other reports are benign with appropriate low scores. Minor adjustments could be made to risk scores in Reports 2 and 4 for consistency, but overall, the scores are justified and aligned with the analysis."

The assigned malware score of 0 and low security risk score (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's static, non-executable nature."

The embedded variable assignments in report 2 are suspicious and could indicate obfuscation or hidden markers but do not constitute active malware. Overall, the security risk is very low, but further review of embedded anomalies is recommended if part of a larger codebase."

The eval() usage should be carefully considered if untrusted input could influence forward reference strings, but otherwise, the code is safe."
