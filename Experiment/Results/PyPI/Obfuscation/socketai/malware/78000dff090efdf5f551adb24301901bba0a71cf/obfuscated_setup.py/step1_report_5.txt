  "purpose": "This code appears to initialize a web server that responds with a simple 'Hello, World!' message, likely for testing or demonstration purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads data from incoming HTTP requests (potentially user input) and environment variables if used.",
  "sinks": "Outputs HTTP responses, and potentially logs or external network connections if present.",
  "flows": "Request data is processed and responded to via the web server functions, with no indication of data being sent elsewhere or processed maliciously.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious function calls, or obfuscated code detected. The code uses standard library functions for web server setup.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a simple HTTP server, typically using Python's built-in modules like http.server or Flask. It processes incoming requests and sends back a static response. No data is transmitted to external domains or logs sensitive info. No obfuscation or unusual language features are present. The code structure appears straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic web server example with no signs of malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks. It is safe based on the provided snippet.",
