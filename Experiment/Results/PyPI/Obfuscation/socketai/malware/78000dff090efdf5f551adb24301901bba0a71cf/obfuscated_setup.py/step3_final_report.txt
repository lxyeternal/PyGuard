  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, file I/O, network connections, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), data processing functions.",
  "sinks": "Network transmissions, file writes, environment variable access, dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or user input flow into data processing, possibly leading to network communication or file modification.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation (0.8), use of eval/exec, dynamic code execution, suspicious data flows, and hidden network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits significant obfuscation and dynamic execution techniques, which are common indicators of malicious intent. The high obfuscation score (0.8) and malware likelihood (0.5) are justified. The presence of eval/exec and obfuscated code suggest potential malicious payloads, warranting a higher security risk score (0.6). Other reports show benign patterns with no obfuscation or malicious activity, aligning with low scores. The overall assessment indicates that the most suspicious code (Report 3) warrants caution, while others are benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code in Report 3 demonstrates red flags such as obfuscation and dynamic execution, justifying a malware score of 0.5, obfuscated score of 0.8, and risk score of 0.6. Other reports are benign with appropriate low scores. Minor adjustments could be made to risk scores in Reports 2 and 4 for consistency, but overall, the scores are justified and aligned with the analysis.",
