  "conclusion": "The dependency code appears largely benign, with one report (Report 2) showing signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution that warrant cautious monitoring. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the evidence. No significant adjustments are necessary; continued runtime analysis is recommended for suspicious patterns, especially in Report 2."
