{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated due to lack of comments or documentation, but it appears to be a Python module that may perform some data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'input_data' variable or parameter, environment variables, and possibly external modules or network sources if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include data output functions, logging, or network communication functions if present, but none are explicitly visible.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources such as variables or environment variables into functions or processing routines, with possible outputs to logs or external calls.",
  "anomalies": "There are no obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, unusual code structures, or obfuscated code. No dynamic execution or suspicious imports are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears straightforward with standard Python syntax. It does not contain obfuscated patterns, excessive dynamic execution, or suspicious function calls. Without additional context or external dependencies, no malicious behavior is evident. No hardcoded secrets or data leakage mechanisms are observed. The absence of network calls or file system modifications suggests no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems to be a benign utility or processing script. The overall security risk is low, with no immediate threats detected.",
