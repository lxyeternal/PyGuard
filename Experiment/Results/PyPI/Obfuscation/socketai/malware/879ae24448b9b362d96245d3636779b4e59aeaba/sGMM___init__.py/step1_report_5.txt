{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform a specific function which is not explicitly stated due to the absence of comments or documentation. It likely involves data processing or network communication based on the code structure.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, function parameters, and possibly external modules that provide data or configuration.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are network calls, file writes, or system commands that could process untrusted data, especially if there are any system or subprocess calls.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or inputs through processing functions and may reach sinks like network or file operations. The exact path depends on how data is used in functions.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials or secrets. No evidence of obfuscated code, malicious backdoors, or suspicious dynamic code execution. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard. No suspicious network domains or command patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code structure suggests normal processing routines with standard library usage. No malicious or malicious-looking code segments are present. No signs of data leakage, code injection, or malicious activity were detected. The absence of comments and the lack of explicit external communication or backdoor mechanisms limit certainty, but overall, the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the current analysis, the code shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be legitimate and safe for use. The confidence level is high due to the absence of suspicious patterns.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
