  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Data processing functions, environment variables, potential network or file operations, obfuscated code structures, dynamic execution points (eval/exec).",
  "sinks": "Potential network connections, file writes, environment variable access, data flows from sources to sinks that could leak data or execute malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or data inputs to sinks like network or file system operations, possibly via dynamic code execution or obfuscated control flow.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), complex control flow, potential hardcoded secrets, unusual variable usage, or misleading constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits typical benign patterns in most reports, with high confidence scores where no suspicious activity is detected. Report 2 shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, raising suspicion but lacking definitive malicious activity. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with their descriptions; obfuscation and dynamic execution are valid indicators of potential malicious intent. The overall security risk remains low to moderate, with the highest concern in Report 2. The malware score of 0.4 is justified, reflecting suspicion but not confirmed malicious behavior. The obfuscation score of 0.8 aligns with the presence of obfuscated constructs. The risk score of 0.5 in Report 2 appropriately indicates moderate concern. Other reports' low scores are consistent with their benign assessments.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency code appears largely benign, with one report (Report 2) showing signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution that warrant cautious monitoring. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the evidence. No significant adjustments are necessary; continued runtime analysis is recommended for suspicious patterns, especially in Report 2.",
