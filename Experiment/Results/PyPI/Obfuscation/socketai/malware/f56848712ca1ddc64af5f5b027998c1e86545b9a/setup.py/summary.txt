  "security_risk": 0.85,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious behavior due to the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during package setup. The pattern aligns with common malware techniques, warranting treating this package as potentially malicious until further decoding of the command confirms its benignity."
