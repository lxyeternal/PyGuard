  "flows": "Checks for 'tahg' directory -> If not exists, executes encoded PowerShell command in background.",
  "anomalies": "Encoded PowerShell command that appears to be obfuscated, executed with no window, and without error handling. No clear purpose provided for the command.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to perform package setup while also executing a background PowerShell process if a specific directory does not exist. The command is encoded in Base64, which suggests obfuscation. The use of subprocess.Popen() with hidden window and encoded commands is suspicious and commonly used for malicious activity or backdoors. The rest of the code is standard setup configuration with benign intent, but the embedded command is a red flag. The code does not appear to have any input sources besides filesystem checks; the main concern is the encoded PowerShell command as a potential malicious payload.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains a typical setup process but includes a suspicious obfuscated PowerShell command triggered conditionally, indicating potential malicious intent or a backdoor. The presence of encoded, hidden execution strongly suggests malicious behavior.",
