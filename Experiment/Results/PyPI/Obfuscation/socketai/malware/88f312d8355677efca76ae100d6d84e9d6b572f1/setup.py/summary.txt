  "malware_score": 0.85,
  "security_risk": 0.85,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious behavior due to obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution conditioned on filesystem state, with error suppression. While definitive confirmation requires decoding the payload, the pattern aligns with common malware tactics. The high scores are justified and indicate a significant security threat."
