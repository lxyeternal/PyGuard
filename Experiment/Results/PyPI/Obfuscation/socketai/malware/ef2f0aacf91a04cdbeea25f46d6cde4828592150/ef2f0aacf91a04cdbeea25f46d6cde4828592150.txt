      "conclusion": "The code contains a high likelihood of malicious behavior due to execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell payload during package setup. The behavior is consistent with malicious or backdoor activity, warranting caution. The assigned malware score of 0.8, obfuscation score of 0.8, and security risk score of 0.85 are justified given the stealthy, obfuscated execution and potential for harm."
