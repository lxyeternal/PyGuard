  "purpose": "The script is intended to set up a Python package, but it also executes hidden PowerShell commands during installation.",
  "sources": "The PowerShell command executed via subprocess.Popen when the 'tahg' directory does not exist.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen call which runs a PowerShell command encoded in base64; potential for malicious code execution.",
  "flows": "Check if 'tahg' exists; if not, execute hidden PowerShell command -> PowerShell command runs potentially malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of encoded PowerShell command with hidden window; attempt to run code silently; absence of error handling specifics; execution of external process during setup.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with importing 'distutils.core.setup' for package setup, then conditionally executes a PowerShell command encoded in base64 via subprocess.Popen if a specific directory does not exist. The encoded command appears to be obfuscated, likely to evade detection. The use of 'powershell' with hidden window and encoded command suggests malicious intent or at least suspicious behavior. The setup call is wrapped in a try-except block that suppresses errors, which is common in obfuscated or malicious scripts to avoid detection. The PowerShell command could potentially execute malicious payloads, such as downloading or executing further malicious code. Overall, the script attempts to run hidden code during installation, which is a serious security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by executing an obfuscated PowerShell command silently during setup, likely to perform unauthorized or malicious actions. Its primary purpose appears to be hidden code execution rather than standard package setup.",
