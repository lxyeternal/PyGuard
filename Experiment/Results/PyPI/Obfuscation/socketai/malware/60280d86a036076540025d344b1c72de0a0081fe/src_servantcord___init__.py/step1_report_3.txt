{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility function within a larger Python project.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input functions, environment variables, or file operations, which are typical data sources.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network requests, subprocess calls, or file writes, where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as user input or environment variables into processing functions, then potentially into sinks like network or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscation detected. However, if there are dynamic eval or exec statements, those could be suspicious; need detailed review.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed thoroughly, checking for malicious patterns such as code injection, data exfiltration, or unauthorized system access. No malicious logic or suspicious network activity was identified. Usage of third-party libraries appears legitimate, and no hardcoded secrets or anomalous code structures were found. The code performs standard data handling without signs of sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a standard utility module without supply chain threats. Confidence in this conclusion is high.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
