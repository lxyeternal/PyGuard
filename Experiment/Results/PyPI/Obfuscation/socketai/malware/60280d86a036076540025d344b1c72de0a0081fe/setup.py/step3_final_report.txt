{
  "purpose": "The code downloads and executes an external executable during package installation, indicating malicious intent and potential supply chain attack.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded URL to a Discord CDN executable, embedded in the function ktvrDyFbLiRWrxbErfaawQsOiKiQaoUi().",
  "sinks": "subprocess.call() executing the downloaded file, leading to remote code execution.",
  "flows": "The function ktvrDyFbLiRWrxbErfaawQsOiKiQaoUi() retrieves the executable from the URL and passes it directly to subprocess.call(), invoked during the custom install class's run method.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated function and variable names, suspicious URL hosting a Windows executable, immediate execution of remote code during setup, misleading package metadata referencing unrelated content.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup process that, during installation, downloads an executable from a Discord CDN URL and runs it immediately, without validation or user consent. The obfuscated names and suspicious URL suggest malicious intent. The package metadata is misleading, further indicating malicious or deceptive purpose. The code's behavior aligns with supply chain malware, capable of executing arbitrary code on the host system during package installation. The high scores assigned in the reports (malware: 1.0, security risk: 1.0, obfuscated: ~0.8) are justified given the severity of the activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, executing remote code during setup, representing a severe supply chain security threat. The reports correctly identify this behavior and assign appropriate high severity scores.",
