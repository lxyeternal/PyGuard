{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be setting up a Python package named 'servantcord' with installation procedures.",
  "sources": "The code reads the URL for a .exe file via urllib.request.urlretrieve and uses environment variables and standard library functions to handle temporary files and subprocess execution.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.call executes a downloaded executable file from the internet, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.",
  "flows": "The code downloads an executable from a Discord CDN URL and immediately executes it during the package installation process.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes executing a remote executable during installation, obfuscated function and variable names, and the download of a Windows executable from a Discord CDN, which is suspicious. Also, the package description and URLs are deceptive (e.g., linking to Rick Astley's video).",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that downloads an executable file from a Discord URL and executes it immediately. This is triggered during the package's installation via a custom install class. The code uses obfuscated function and variable names, indicating potential malicious intent. The URL points to an .exe file hosted on Discord, which could be malicious. Executing remote code during package installation is highly suspicious and can be used to compromise systems. The package metadata appears to be intentionally misleading. Overall, the code shows clear malicious behavior with high potential for harm.",
  "conclusion": "This code demonstrates malicious behavior by downloading and executing a remote executable during package installation, which poses a severe security risk. It is highly likely designed to compromise systems upon installation.",
