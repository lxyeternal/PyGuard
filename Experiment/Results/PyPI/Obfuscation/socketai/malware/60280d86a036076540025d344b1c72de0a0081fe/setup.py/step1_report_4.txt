{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a setup script for a Python package that, upon installation, downloads and executes a remote executable file.",
  "sources": "The URL in 'ktvrDyFbLiRWrxbErfaawQsOiKiQaoUi' function retrieves an executable file from a remote server. The download path is a temporary directory on the host system.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.call executes the downloaded executable, which can run malicious code. The code retrieves an executable from a URL and executes it without validation or user consent.",
  "flows": "The code downloads a file from a remote URL ('https://cdn.discordapp.com/.../funnymoment.exe') into a temporary directory, then executes it directly via subprocess.call.",
  "anomalies": "The function names and variable names are obfuscated, which is unusual and can indicate malicious intent. The URL points to an executable hosted on Discord, which is uncommon for legitimate package behavior. The setup script runs the remote executable immediately after installation, which is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and defines a function that downloads an executable file from a Discord CDN URL. This file is saved to a temporary directory and then executed without any validation. The custom install class overrides the 'run' method to invoke this download-and-execute sequence during package installation. The setup configuration specifies package details and points to a non-standard URL (a YouTube link) and an obfuscated class name, further suggesting malicious intent. Overall, the code is designed to surreptitiously download and run potentially malicious software during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains clear malicious behavior: it downloads and executes a remote executable without user consent or validation, which can be used for malware delivery. The obfuscated names, unusual URLs, and immediate execution indicate malicious intent. The package should be considered highly dangerous and should not be used.",
