  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that includes a custom installation step which downloads and executes an external executable from a remote URL during installation.",
  "sources": "The URL 'https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1126844776025694281/1126848315615612938/funnymoment.exe' used in urllib.request.urlretrieve; the subprocess.call command that executes the downloaded file.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.call(TwtVKGReHkeJygJLxdfLKZjsXEhvzvSA) which executes the downloaded executable, potentially executing malicious code.",
  "flows": "The code retrieves an executable from a remote URL (source), saves it to a temporary directory, and then runs it directly (sink), representing a clear source-to-sink malicious flow.",
  "anomalies": "The function ktvrDyFbLiRWrxbErfaawQsOiKiQaoUi performs an automatic download and execution of an external executable during package installation. The code uses obfuscated variable and function names, and the URL points to a suspicious file (an executable hosted on Discord, which is uncommon for legitimate package behavior). The setup metadata contains an unusual URL (a Rickroll link), possibly intended to disguise malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and defines a function ktvrDyFbLiRWrxbErfaawQsOiKiQaoUi that downloads an executable file from a remote URL and executes it immediately. This function is called during the installation process via a custom class sdXRuCdeKXgcumXQuMMImmIKVItaPSEo which overrides the 'install' command. The setup configuration specifies package details but includes obfuscated variable names and an unusual URL in the 'url' parameter. The core malicious activity is the automatic download and execution of an external executable at install time, which is highly suspicious and indicative of malicious behavior or supply chain attack.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a clear malicious behavior: it downloads and executes an external executable during package installation, which could lead to remote code execution, malware infection, or system compromise. The obfuscated naming and suspicious URL further support the malicious intent. This package should be considered unsafe to install.",
