  "purpose": "Implementation of SOCKS4/5 proxy client functionalities, including connection handling, authentication, and address resolution.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from network sockets, module imports, and function parameters.",
  "sinks": "Socket send/recv operations, address resolution functions, and network communication endpoints.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters or network sockets through async send/recv functions, address resolution, and connection establishment, potentially passing credentials and configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with nonsensical variable and class names, complex nested async functions, conditional dynamic imports of asyncio modules, no hardcoded secrets, and extensive protocol implementation without explicit malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a SOCKS proxy client supporting SOCKS4/5 and HTTP/HTTPS protocols, with functions for connecting, authenticating, resolving addresses, and managing socket communication asynchronously. Obfuscation and complex async flows are used, but no evidence of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or sabotage is present. The code appears to be a legitimate proxy client, possibly with obfuscation for intellectual property or code protection reasons. The absence of hardcoded secrets and malicious payloads, combined with the detailed protocol handling, suggests it is intended for legitimate use, though its obfuscation warrants cautious deployment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a sophisticated, obfuscated SOCKS proxy client implementation with no explicit malicious activity detected. Its obfuscation and complexity could be used to hide malicious intent, but based on the provided analysis, it appears legitimate. The malware risk score is low, but obfuscation and potential misuse justify moderate security concern. It should be reviewed further in deployment environments, and runtime monitoring is recommended.",
