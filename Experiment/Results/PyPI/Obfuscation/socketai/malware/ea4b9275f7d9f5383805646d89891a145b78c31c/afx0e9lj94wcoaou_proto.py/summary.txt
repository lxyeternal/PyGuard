  "conclusion": "The code is a sophisticated, obfuscated SOCKS proxy client implementation with no explicit malicious activity detected. Its obfuscation and complexity could be used to hide malicious intent, but based on the provided analysis, it appears legitimate. The malware risk score is low, but obfuscation and potential misuse justify moderate security concern. It should be reviewed further in deployment environments, and runtime monitoring is recommended."
