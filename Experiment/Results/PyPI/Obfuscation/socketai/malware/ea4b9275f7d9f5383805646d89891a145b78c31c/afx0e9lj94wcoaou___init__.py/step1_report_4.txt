{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a network proxy or SOCKS client implementation, defining imports, version info, and exported functions/classes.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto), string assignment for version info.",
  "sinks": "Exported identifiers (__all__), possibly used in other modules or scripts, but no direct data sinks or network connections are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Imports are read at startup; no runtime data flows involving untrusted input are evident in this fragment.",
  "anomalies": "Use of non-descriptive, seemingly random module attribute names (e.g., shAEzgWJFRsKzOAPnFzmpVBvnksPALnT, qZYmHZjJnuAnPfntNTHTVfKMlhBXqkDZ). No obvious secrets, hardcoded credentials, or malicious backdoors. The obfuscation of attribute names might be suspicious but could also be a code-generation or obfuscation measure.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs imports from internal modules and defines an exported API via __all__. The module version is declared as '0.1.2'. The use of seemingly random attribute names in import statements could indicate obfuscation or code generation, but in the context of this fragment, it does not necessarily imply malicious intent. No network activity, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The overall structure is typical for a Python package exposing certain functions/classes. The randomness in attribute names and the lack of visible logic or data handling points toward either obfuscation or a code-generation process rather than malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as part of a proxy or network-related Python package, with no clear malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage present. The unusual attribute naming may warrant further review in the context of the full project but is not inherently malicious in this snippet.",
