{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module defining internal imports and exposing an API for a network proxy or SOCKS client library, with obfuscated attribute names likely for code obfuscation or auto-generation.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto), version string, and the __all__ list.",
  "sinks": "None present; the code does not process untrusted input or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code is primarily import and export declarations without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated attribute names in import statements (e.g., shAEzgWJFRsKzOAPnFzmpVBvnksPALnT), which are non-descriptive and suggest obfuscation or code generation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python module that imports internal components with obfuscated attribute names, then exposes a set of identifiers via __all__. There are no signs of malicious activity, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or embedded payloads. The obfuscation appears to be a deliberate pattern, possibly for code protection or generated code, not necessarily malicious. The overall structure indicates a network utility, likely a SOCKS proxy or similar, with no evident vulnerabilities or malicious intent. The reports' scores reflect this: malware score 0, obfuscation score 0.6, and low security risk 0.2, which are consistent with the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and is likely part of a legitimate network proxy library. The obfuscated attribute names warrant further review in the full project context but do not indicate malicious activity. The supply chain risk is minimal based on this fragment.",
