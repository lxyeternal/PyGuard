  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for specific error handling scenarios",
  "sources": "Class definitions that inherit from base exception classes",
  "sinks": "No data processing, input reading, or output writing present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; only class inheritance is defined",
  "anomalies": "Class names are obfuscated, appear as random strings; no meaningful identifiers",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of multiple class definitions inheriting from standard exceptions and error classes, with no logic, data handling, or external interactions. The obfuscated class names suggest possible intent to hide or obfuscate the purpose, but there are no active malicious actions such as data exfiltration, network activity, or code injection. The absence of executable logic or suspicious patterns indicates benign intent. The only notable aspect is the use of obfuscated class names, which alone do not indicate malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of placeholder or obfuscated exception classes without malicious behavior. There is no evidence of malware or security risks. The obfuscation may suggest an attempt to hide intent, but without active malicious code or external interactions, it remains benign.",
