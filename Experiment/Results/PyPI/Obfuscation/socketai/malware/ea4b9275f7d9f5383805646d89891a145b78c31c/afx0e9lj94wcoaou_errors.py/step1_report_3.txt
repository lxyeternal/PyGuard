  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling, with some subclasses potentially representing specific error types.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; all class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data leaks, no untrusted data handling, no effect points identified.",
  "flows": "Class inheritance structure; no data flow from sources to sinks as there are no runtime data manipulations.",
  "anomalies": "Class names are obfuscated with nonsensical, randomized strings; no meaningful identifiers. No functional code or logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from standard exception types, with names that appear intentionally obfuscated. There are no functions, no data processing, no network operations, or any behavior that could be malicious. The obfuscated class names may suggest an attempt to hide intent, but without any active code or external interactions, there is no indication of malicious behavior. The absence of code logic or data flow points to benign intent, possibly for obfuscation or as a placeholder.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of obfuscated class definitions inheriting from exception types, with no active logic or data handling. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation appears superficial and does not indicate malicious intent.",
