{
  "purpose": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes, some inheriting from Exception and others from OSError, with seemingly random class names.",
  "sources": "Class definitions are sources; no external input handling present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing, output, or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; all are simple class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Class names are obfuscated and nonsensical; no meaningful logic, data handling, or network activity. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains class definitions for custom exceptions, with obfuscated, meaningless names. There is no code execution, input handling, data processing, or external communication. The lack of logic or functionality suggests this is either placeholder code or intentionally obscured but not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be obfuscated but does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It only defines exception classes with obscure names, providing no evidence of malicious intent or security threats.",
