  "conclusion": "The code is a set of obfuscated exception class definitions with no operational logic or external interactions. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security threats. The high obfuscation scores are justified, but malware and security risk scores should remain at zero or very low. Overall, the code appears benign, serving as placeholder or intentionally obfuscated exception classes without malicious intent."
