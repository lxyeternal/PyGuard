{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes, primarily subclasses of Exception and OSError, with no additional functionality or logic.",
  "sources": "Class definitions at the start of the code, creating new exception types.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only declares class types.",
  "anomalies": "All class names are obfuscated or nonsensical, with no descriptive identifiers or comments. No actual code logic or behavior. No input handling or external interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of class declarations for various custom exceptions, many of which inherit from a base exception class or built-in exceptions. Class names are intentionally obfuscated and do not suggest any functionality. There are no functions, method calls, data processing, external I/O, or other behaviors that could be malicious. The lack of logic, data flow, or external interactions indicates no malicious intent or security risks. This appears to be a set of obfuscated placeholder classes, potentially for concealment or code obfuscation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks. The code is simply defining obfuscated exception classes with no operational logic. No malicious intent or security threats are present based on this snippet.",
