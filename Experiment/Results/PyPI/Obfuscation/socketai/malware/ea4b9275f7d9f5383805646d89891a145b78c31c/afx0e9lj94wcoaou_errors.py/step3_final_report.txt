{
  "purpose": "Defines multiple custom exception classes with obfuscated names, inheriting from standard exception types, with no additional logic or data handling.",
  "sources": "Class definitions serving as exception types; no input, data reading, or external data sources present.",
  "sinks": "No data flows, external calls, or data leaks; purely class declarations without external interactions.",
  "flows": "None; no source-to-sink data flow exists in the code.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class names that do not convey meaningful purpose; lack of comments or identifiers; no operational code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of obfuscated exception class definitions with no logic, data flow, or external interactions. The obfuscation appears superficial, possibly for concealment or placeholder purposes. No malicious activity, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities are evident. Malware scores are correctly set to 0, and high obfuscation scores are justified due to nonsensical class names. Security risk scores are appropriately low, reflecting the benign nature of the code. The high obfuscation may be intended to conceal purpose but does not imply malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of obfuscated exception class definitions with no operational logic or external interactions. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security threats. The high obfuscation scores are justified, but malware and security risk scores should remain at zero or very low. Overall, the code appears benign, serving as placeholder or intentionally obfuscated exception classes without malicious intent.",
