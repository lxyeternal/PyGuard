      "conclusion": "The code exhibits all traits of malware: heavy obfuscation, dynamic code execution, covert file operations, and potential network activity. The behavior aligns with malicious payload deployment, backdoor setup, or data exfiltration. The high scores for malware (1), obfuscation (1), and security risk (1) are justified based on these indicators."

      "obfuscated": 0.8,
      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a network utility for establishing proxy connections, heavily obfuscated, with no direct evidence of malicious payloads. The obfuscation and flexible URL handling warrant caution, but the code itself does not demonstrate overt malicious behavior. The security risk is moderate, and the malware likelihood is low but non-negligible due to obfuscation. Further review of integrated components is recommended before deployment."

      "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated proxy and DNS resolution utility that does not exhibit explicit malicious behavior. The high obfuscation level warrants caution, but there is no concrete evidence of malware or malicious activity. The security risk is low, but further review is recommended if deployed in sensitive environments."

      "conclusion": "The code is a sophisticated, obfuscated SOCKS proxy client implementation with no explicit malicious activity detected. Its obfuscation and complexity could be used to hide malicious intent, but based on the provided analysis, it appears legitimate. The malware risk score is low, but obfuscation and potential misuse justify moderate security concern. It should be reviewed further in deployment environments, and runtime monitoring is recommended."

      "conclusion": "The code is a set of obfuscated exception class definitions with no operational logic or external interactions. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security threats. The high obfuscation scores are justified, but malware and security risk scores should remain at zero or very low. Overall, the code appears benign, serving as placeholder or intentionally obfuscated exception classes without malicious intent."
