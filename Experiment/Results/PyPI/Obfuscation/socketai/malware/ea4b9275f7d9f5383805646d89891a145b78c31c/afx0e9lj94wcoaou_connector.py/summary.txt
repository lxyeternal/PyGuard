  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated proxy and DNS resolution utility that does not exhibit explicit malicious behavior. The high obfuscation level warrants caution, but there is no concrete evidence of malware or malicious activity. The security risk is low, but further review is recommended if deployed in sensitive environments."
