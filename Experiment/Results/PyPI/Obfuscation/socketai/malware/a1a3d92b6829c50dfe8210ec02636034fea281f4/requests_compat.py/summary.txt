  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a compatibility and environment setup module. Obfuscation is present but not evidence of malicious behavior. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2). The obfuscation score is moderate (~0.7), reflecting the variable naming. Overall, the supply chain risk is minimal, but obfuscation warrants monitoring in broader contexts."
