{
  "purpose": "This code appears to set up environment and compatibility checks for different Python versions, and imports various standard libraries for handling data, URLs, cookies, and JSON serialization.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include sys.version_info for environment detection and module imports which do not take external input directly.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or exposed; no data output, network connections, or file writes are shown.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow from sources to sinks; primarily imports and variable assignments based on environment detection.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names and dynamic imports (e.g., fallback for 'chardet' and 'json') suggest attempts to obscure intent. No actual network or system modification code present.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs environment detection and conditional importing of modules. It defines some type aliases. The obfuscated variable names and dynamic imports could be suspicious but do not necessarily indicate malicious behavior. There are no network calls, data exfiltration, code execution, or other suspicious activities within the provided code. The structure seems consistent with a compatibility or utility library setup. Overall, no malicious or maliciously intended behavior is evident based on the code provided.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a setup/utility module focused on environment detection and import compatibility. It does not contain malware or security risks in its current form. The obfuscated variable names may be an attempt at concealment but are not inherently malicious.",
