{
  "purpose": "Setup environment, compatibility, import modules, define type aliases.",
  "sources": "Module imports, sys.version_info, conditional imports based on availability.",
  "sinks": "None; code does not process untrusted data or perform network/system operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; primarily import and variable definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, multiple fallback import mechanisms, version checks.",
  "analysis": "The code is mainly environment setup with obfuscated variable names, conditional imports, and compatibility handling. It does not process untrusted input, perform network activity, or execute malicious operations. The obfuscation may be for concealment but does not indicate malicious intent. The lack of data flows or dangerous functions suggests low security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a compatibility and environment setup module. Obfuscation is present but not evidence of malicious behavior. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2). The obfuscation score is moderate (~0.7), reflecting the variable naming. Overall, the supply chain risk is minimal, but obfuscation warrants monitoring in broader contexts.",
