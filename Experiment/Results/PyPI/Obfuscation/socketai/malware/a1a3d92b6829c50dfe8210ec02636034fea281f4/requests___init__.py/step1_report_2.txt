{
  "purpose": "To provide a brief description and usage examples of the Requests HTTP library in Python.",
  "sources": "Imports the 'requests' module; references to 'requests.get', 'requests.post', and related functions; documentation URL; copyright and license info.",
  "sinks": "The code mentions functions that handle external input and network requests, such as 'requests.get' and 'requests.post', which are sinks where untrusted data can be sent or received.",
  "flows": "User calls 'requests.get' or 'requests.post' with URLs and payloads; data flows from user input to the functions and potentially to external servers; responses are received and processed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; the code appears to be straightforward documentation and usage examples.",
  "analysis": "The code is a documentation snippet describing the Requests library, including example usage of GET and POST methods. It references external URLs and standard library functions. No code is executed that processes untrusted input or performs malicious actions. The content appears to be informational, with no embedded or hidden malicious code. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. Since the code is purely illustrative and relies on a well-known third-party library, it does not pose a security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is purely informational documentation demonstrating the usage of the Requests library. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. There are no signs of malware, suspicious flows, or anomalies. Overall, the code is safe.",
