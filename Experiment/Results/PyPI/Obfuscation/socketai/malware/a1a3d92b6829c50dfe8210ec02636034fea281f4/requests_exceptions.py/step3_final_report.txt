{
  "purpose": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes with obfuscated class names and static string constants, likely for error handling or as placeholders. It appears to be intentionally obfuscated to conceal its true purpose.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and static string constants within the code; no external data sources or input handling observed.",
  "sinks": "No data processing, external network interactions, or sensitive operations are present; no sinks identified.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code only declares classes and constants without active data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation through nonsensical class and variable names, import statements with obscure identifiers, static string constants with no apparent purpose, and lack of functional logic or data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of obfuscated class definitions inheriting from standard exceptions or custom classes, with static string attributes that seem arbitrary. The import statement references a nonsensical class name, which is suspicious. The absence of functional logic, data processing, or external interactions suggests this code is either placeholder, auto-generated, or intentionally obfuscated to hide malicious intent. Given the lack of active malicious operations such as network activity, data exfiltration, or system manipulation, the code appears benign but warrants caution due to obfuscation. The heavy obfuscation pattern could be used to conceal malicious payloads or backdoors in a larger context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated class definitions with static constants, showing no evidence of malicious activity within this fragment. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. The low malware score (0.2) and high obfuscation score (~0.85) are appropriate, with a moderate security risk (~0.3) due to potential concealment. Further analysis of the entire package is recommended to ensure no malicious code is hidden elsewhere.",
