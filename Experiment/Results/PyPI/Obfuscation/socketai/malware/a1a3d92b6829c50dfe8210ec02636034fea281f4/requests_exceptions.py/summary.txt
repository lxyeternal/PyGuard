  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated class definitions with static constants, showing no evidence of malicious activity within this fragment. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. The low malware score (0.2) and high obfuscation score (~0.85) are appropriate, with a moderate security risk (~0.3) due to potential concealment. Further analysis of the entire package is recommended to ensure no malicious code is hidden elsewhere."
