  "conclusion": "While the code appears to be a legitimate HTTP utility library, the heavy obfuscation and complex control flow suggest potential concealment of malicious behavior. The high obfuscation score (around 0.8) and elevated malware suspicion (around 0.7) are justified. Further dynamic analysis and source verification are recommended before deployment, especially considering supply chain security implications."
