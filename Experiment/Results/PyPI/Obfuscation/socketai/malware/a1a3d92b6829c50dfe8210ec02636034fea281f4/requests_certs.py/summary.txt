  "conclusion": "All reports correctly identify that the code snippets are benign documentation with textual anomalies that do not constitute malicious activity. The malware score should remain at 0, the obfuscation score can be slightly adjusted to around 0.2–0.3 to reflect the textual anomalies, and the overall security risk remains very low (~0.1). No active threats are detected, and the anomalies are likely benign artifacts."
