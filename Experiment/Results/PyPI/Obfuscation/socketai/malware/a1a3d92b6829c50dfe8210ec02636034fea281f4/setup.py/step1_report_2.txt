{
  "purpose": "The code is primarily designed to set up a Python package, manage dependencies, and include testing infrastructure. It also contains code for automatic installation of the 'requests' library and malicious-looking activities on Windows systems, such as downloading and executing files from external URLs, and manipulating system files and processes.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from '__version__.py', reading README.md, environment variables, and network requests to external URLs.",
  "sinks": "Execution of downloaded files, moving and deleting local files, running system commands via subprocess, network requests to potentially malicious URLs.",
  "flows": "Source: version info / environment / network request -> Sink: subprocess commands / file writes / system commands.",
  "anomalies": "Code for automatically installing 'requests' library if missing, downloading and executing external files, moving files to potentially execute malicious payloads, running 'cmd' commands to delete files, using network IP addresses directly, and executing remote scripts via subprocess.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with standard setup procedures, reading version info and README content. It includes a Windows-specific block that attempts to retrieve the temp directory, install 'requests' if not present, and then download and execute external files from hardcoded IP addresses. The downloaded files are saved locally and executed as batch scripts. There are multiple subprocess calls executing system commands, including moving, deleting files, and running potentially malicious scripts. The code is obfuscated with non-descriptive variable names, and contains network operations that fetch files from external IPs, which are then executed, indicating malicious intent. The presence of code that attempts to run external scripts and manipulate system files is highly suspicious and aligns with common malware behaviors. The package setup code itself appears legitimate, but the Windows-specific section indicates malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains clear signs of malicious behavior, especially on Windows systems, including downloading, executing, and deleting files from external sources, and running system commands that could harm or compromise the host system. The setup portion appears standard but is overshadowed by the malicious payloads embedded within the script. Overall, the code is highly suspicious with a high likelihood of malware.",
