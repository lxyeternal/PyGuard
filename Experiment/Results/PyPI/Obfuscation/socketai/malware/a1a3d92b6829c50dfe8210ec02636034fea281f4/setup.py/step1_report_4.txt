{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up and configure a Python package, including conditional installation of dependencies and running post-installation scripts that perform network operations and execute system commands.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from __version__.py, reading README.md, importing system modules, and fetching remote content via requests.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to external IP addresses, writing files based on remote data, executing system commands (move, del, cmd calls), potentially executing downloaded scripts or batch files.",
  "flows": "Remote content fetched via requests → saved to files → executed via subprocess commands → system commands executed with shell=True, potentially running malicious payloads.",
  "anomalies": "Download of files from suspicious IP addresses (52.14.229.35), saving to local files with misleading names (local_copy.txt, local_b.txt), moving and executing batch files, executing system commands with shell=True, no validation or sanitization of remote content, presence of obfuscated variable names, and conditional code that adapts to Windows environment to perform potentially malicious system operations.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with package setup routines, which are typical. However, there is a significant malicious component in the Windows-specific section. It attempts to download remote files from an IP address that appears suspicious. These files are saved locally, renamed to batch files, and then executed via subprocess calls with shell=True, which is dangerous as it can run arbitrary code. The script also attempts to use system commands like 'move' and 'del' to hide or delete files. The use of 'net session' with output parsing for 'Access is denied' indicates an attempt to check for administrative permissions, possibly to escalate privileges or check for security measures. The code does not verify the downloaded content, and fetching from an IP address instead of a legitimate URL suggests malicious intent, such as delivering malware, backdoors, or executing malicious payloads. The rest of the code is standard setup boilerplate, but the Windows-specific section is highly suspicious and indicates malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains clear malicious behavior, primarily targeting Windows systems. It downloads and executes remote files without validation, uses system commands to manipulate files and potentially execute malicious payloads, and performs privilege checks. The overall security risk score is high due to these behaviors. The package could be used as a vector for malware distribution or system compromise.",
