{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom data structures: a mutable mapping class with obfuscated names and a lookup class, both managing internal data without external interactions.",
  "sources": "Internal data storage within class attributes and methods; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No external data output, network activity, or data exfiltration points detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows are confined within class methods, from input parameters to internal storage and retrieval; no external flows observed.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of class and variable names; use of __dict__ in get method; no malicious patterns such as hardcoded credentials or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The classes serve as custom data containers with obfuscated identifiers, implementing standard mapping behaviors. No external communication, code injection, or malicious logic is present. Obfuscation raises suspicion but is not indicative of malicious intent. The code's structure and behavior are benign, functioning solely as internal data management structures.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as custom data containers with obfuscated names. No malicious activity or security risks are evident. The high obfuscation score is justified but does not imply malicious intent. The overall security risk remains low.",
