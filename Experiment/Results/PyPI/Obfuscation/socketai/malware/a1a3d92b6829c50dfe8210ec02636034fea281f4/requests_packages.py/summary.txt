  "conclusion": "The code analysis reports are largely consistent and cautious. Minor score adjustments to obfuscation and malware levels are suggested based on signs of dynamic execution and suspicious patterns. Overall, the dependency appears low risk but warrants ongoing monitoring if dynamic or obfuscated code is confirmed."
