  "purpose": "Assessment of supply chain security for the open source dependency based on provided code analysis reports.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user inputs, network modules (socket), random number generation, dynamic execution functions ('eval', 'exec'), imported modules such as os, sys, socket, random.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, environment variable access, dynamic code execution points, data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive functions.",
  "flows": "Sources include environment variables and user inputs; flows lead to potential dynamic execution, network activity, or data leakage points.",
  "anomalies": "Signs of obfuscation or unnecessary complexity, use of 'eval'/'exec', suspicious network activity, access to environment variables, use of 'random' for unpredictability.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits potential signs of malicious behavior primarily through dynamic execution functions and network activity. Some reports indicate signs of obfuscation or complexity, which could be used to hide malicious intent. The scores assigned across reports are generally consistent with the evidence, with low malware (0.2) and moderate security risk (0.4). Slight adjustments are recommended: increasing obfuscated scores to ~0.3 where signs of obfuscation or complexity are noted, and considering higher malware scores (~0.4) if dynamic execution or network activity is confirmed. The absence of explicit malicious payloads or active malicious code keeps the malware scores low, but potential misuse warrants cautious scoring.",
  "conclusion": "The code analysis reports are largely consistent and cautious. Minor score adjustments to obfuscation and malware levels are suggested based on signs of dynamic execution and suspicious patterns. Overall, the dependency appears low risk but warrants ongoing monitoring if dynamic or obfuscated code is confirmed.",
