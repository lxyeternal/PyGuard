  "conclusion": "The code exhibits multiple indicators of malicious behavior, including data exfiltration of environment variables and private keys, obfuscation tactics, and execution during package setup. These signs point to a high probability of malicious intent, classifying it as malware designed for covert data theft. The suspicious network activity, obfuscated variables, and sensitive file access justify a high malware score and security risk assessment."
