  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a specific task or function, but the exact intent is unclear without further context or comments.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the user, environment variables, and potentially external modules or network calls.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or system commands that could be exploited if untrusted data is involved.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions, potentially reaching sinks that perform actions such as network communication or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual control flow. However, lack of comments and some dynamic features merit caution.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward and does not contain any overt signs of malicious behavior. It utilizes standard Python libraries and typical coding patterns. There are no indications of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The structure suggests standard data handling without suspicious dynamic execution or obfuscated logic. Due to the lack of detailed context or hidden behaviors, the overall security risk appears low.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not demonstrate malicious intent or security risks. It seems to perform a normal function without evident malware or supply chain attacks. The confidence level is high given the clarity of the code and absence of suspicious patterns.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
