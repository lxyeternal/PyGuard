{
  "purpose": "To assess the security and malicious potential of the open source dependency based on provided code snippets and reports.",
  "sources": "Code execution points, data input/output, environment variables, network connections, external data sinks.",
  "sinks": "Network communication functions, file write operations, environment variable access, data serialization/deserialization.",
  "flows": "Input sources (e.g., user input, environment variables) to sinks (e.g., network, file system) via function calls and data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, suspicious network domains, obfuscated code, unusual dynamic code execution, hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code is absent or benign in all reports, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows. Static analysis indicates standard data handling with no anomalies. Confidence levels are high where code exists, and malware scores are zero, consistent with the absence of malicious indicators. Risk scores are low (0.2), reflecting cautious but justified assessment of potential external data interactions. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious network activity are detected. The scores across reports are coherent and justified by the analyses.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency appears safe with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks based on static analysis. The scores are consistent with the findings, and no further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
