{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a malicious Python package designed to execute hidden network requests and potentially perform malicious activities during installation or development.",
  "sources": "The code reads the system login name via os.getlogin(), and constructs a URL using a hardcoded IP address (194.233.164.169). It also reads package metadata and uses setuptools for setup.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get() call in the function XeVJvIWahDFKpUWFdQzmLkuQWvJCFYtO() sends data to an external IP address without user consent, acting as a data exfiltration point or command-and-control communication.",
  "flows": "The function XeVJvIWahDFKpUWFdQzmLkuQWvJCFYtO() is called during the 'install' command's execution, which is triggered during package installation, causing an external HTTP request with sensitive system info (login name).",
  "anomalies": "The code uses obfuscated function and variable names, hardcoded IP address and URL construction that includes system info, and makes network requests without user awareness. The code also suppresses clarity about its malicious intent via obscure naming.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard and third-party modules, defines a hardcoded IP address, and includes a function that retrieves the current system login name and makes a GET request to a remote server using that info. The setup configuration uses non-descriptive function names and custom classes inheriting from setuptools commands, which invoke the malicious function during package installation or development. This pattern suggests an attempt to hide data exfiltration or remote control communication within the package's lifecycle scripts. The code’s obfuscation and network activity during install strongly indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains clear malicious behavior, including hidden network communication that could be used for command-and-control or data exfiltration. The use of obfuscated identifiers and network requests during install phases confirms malicious intent. It should be considered highly dangerous and avoided.",
