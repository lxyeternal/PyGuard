{
  "purpose": "The code is a malicious setup script that exfiltrates user login information to an external IP during package installation or development, using obfuscated variable names and undefined variables to hide its intent.",
  "sources": "os.getlogin(), the function XeVJvIWahDFKpUWFdQzmLkuQWvJCFYtO() which constructs a URL with undefined variables 'ccip' and 'user' and performs requests.get()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() call to an external IP address, transmitting system login info",
  "flows": "Source: os.getlogin() and system info -> URL constructed with undefined variables -> requests.get() to external IP during install/develop commands",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names, use of undefined variables 'ccip' and 'user' in URL, unnecessary imports, code executed during setup commands, package metadata claiming malicious intent",
  "analysis": "The code overrides setup commands to execute a function that constructs a URL with undefined variables and performs a network request to an external IP, indicating data exfiltration. Obfuscated names and unused imports suggest an attempt to hide malicious behavior. The package metadata explicitly states malicious intent. The network activity occurs during package installation or development, which is suspicious. The undefined variables would cause runtime errors unless set elsewhere, but their presence indicates an attempt to obfuscate or dynamically generate URLs. Overall, the code demonstrates malicious exfiltration behavior with obfuscation, consistent with supply chain attack tactics.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, designed to exfiltrate user login information during package setup, with obfuscation and suspicious network activity confirming malicious intent. The package should be flagged and avoided.",
