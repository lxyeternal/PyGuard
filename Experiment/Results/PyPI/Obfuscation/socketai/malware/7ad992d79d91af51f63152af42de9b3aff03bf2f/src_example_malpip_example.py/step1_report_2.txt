  "purpose": "Simple function that increments a number by 1.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'number' provided to the function.",
  "sinks": "Returns the incremented number; no external sinks or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Input 'number' flows directly to the output after incrementing.",
  "anomalies": "Function name appears obfuscated or randomly generated, but no malicious code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function with a non-descriptive, obfuscated name that takes a single input and returns the input incremented by 1. There are no external data reads, no network activity, no use of environment variables, or other suspicious behavior. The code is straightforward and does not perform any malicious actions. The function's simplicity and lack of side effects suggest benign intent, but the obfuscated naming could be a sign of trying to hide intent; however, the logic itself is harmless.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign function that increments a number. Despite the obfuscated name, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
