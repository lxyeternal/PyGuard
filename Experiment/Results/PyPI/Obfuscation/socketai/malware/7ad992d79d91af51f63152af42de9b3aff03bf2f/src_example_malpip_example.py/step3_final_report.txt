  "flows": "Input 'number' flows directly to the return expression 'number + 1'",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function name, but no malicious code or external data handling",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, straightforward function that adds 1 to its input. The only notable aspect is the obfuscated function name, which does not affect the benign nature of the logic. No external data sources, network activity, or malicious behavior are present. The function performs a basic arithmetic operation with no side effects or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, trivial increment function with an obfuscated name. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. The obfuscation does not imply malicious intent given the simplicity of the logic.",
