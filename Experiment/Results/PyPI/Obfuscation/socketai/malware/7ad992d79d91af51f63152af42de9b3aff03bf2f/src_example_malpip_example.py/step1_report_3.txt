{
  "purpose": "The function appears to increment a given number by 1.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'number', which is used directly in an addition operation.",
  "sinks": "Return statement outputs the incremented number; no external or untrusted data output.",
  "flows": "Input 'number' flows directly to the return statement after addition.",
  "anomalies": "Function name appears obfuscated or randomly generated, but the code itself is straightforward and simple.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function with a seemingly random name that takes a parameter and returns that parameter incremented by 1. There are no external data reads, no environment variable access, no network connections, or any other typical malicious behavior indicators. The code's simplicity suggests no malicious intent. The function could be part of a larger program, but as presented, it performs a benign operation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and performs a simple increment operation. No malicious behavior, data leakage, or security issues are evident.",
