{
  "purpose": "The function appears to increment a given number by 1.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'number' is the source of data, likely from an external caller.",
  "sinks": "The return statement outputs the incremented number; no external sinks or data leaks are apparent.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the input parameter 'number' directly to the return statement after incrementation.",
  "anomalies": "The function name is an obfuscated, nonsensical string; no other unusual code structures or secrets are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple function that adds 1 to the input. The function name is obfuscated but the logic is straightforward and benign. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The lack of external dependencies and simple flow reduce suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a basic, harmless incrementation operation with obfuscated naming. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
