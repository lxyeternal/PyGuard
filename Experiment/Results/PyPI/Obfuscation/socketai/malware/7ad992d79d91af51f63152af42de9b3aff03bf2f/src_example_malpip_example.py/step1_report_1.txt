  "purpose": "Simple function to increment a given number by 1",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'number'",
  "sinks": "Return statement operating on 'number'",
  "flows": "Input 'number' flows directly to the return statement with an addition operation",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; the function name appears intentionally obfuscated but is benign",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function with a nonsensical name that takes a single argument and returns the argument incremented by 1. There are no external data sources, no external calls, and no side effects. The function is straightforward and performs a basic arithmetic operation. The obfuscated name might be suspicious but on its own does not imply malicious intent. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign function that increments a number. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks present.",
