  "purpose": "Simple function that increments a number by 1.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'number'.",
  "sinks": "Return statement outputs the incremented number.",
  "flows": "Input 'number' flows directly to the return statement after increment.",
  "anomalies": "Function name appears obfuscated, but the code itself is straightforward. No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic execution, no suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function with an obfuscated name that takes a single parameter and returns the value incremented by one. There are no external data reads, no side effects, no suspicious logic. The obfuscated name could be a tactic to hide intent, but the code's behavior is benign and simple. No malicious code, no data leaks, no external communication, and no obfuscation of logic beyond the naming.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a basic arithmetic operation without any malicious intent. Despite the obfuscated function name, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet.",
