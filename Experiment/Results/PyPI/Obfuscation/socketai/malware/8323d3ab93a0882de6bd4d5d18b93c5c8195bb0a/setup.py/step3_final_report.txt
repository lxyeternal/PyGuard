{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package and conditionally executes an encoded PowerShell command if the directory 'tahg' does not exist, likely for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads the existence of the 'tahg' directory; executes subprocess with encoded PowerShell command",
  "sinks": "Execution of the encoded PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with hidden window",
  "flows": "Checks directory existence -> executes encoded PowerShell command silently if missing",
  "anomalies": "Use of Base64-encoded PowerShell command, silent exception handling, obfuscated package name, hidden process creation",
  "analysis": "The code performs a benign-looking setup but contains a hidden, encoded PowerShell command executed silently, which is a common tactic in malicious payloads. The silent exception handling conceals errors, and the obfuscated package name suggests an attempt to evade detection. The encoded command's content is unknown, but its presence alone is suspicious. The high use of obfuscation, covert execution, and stealth tactics strongly indicate malicious intent, typical of supply chain attacks or malware delivery mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits behaviors characteristic of malicious payloads, notably executing an encoded PowerShell command in stealth mode. While the exact payload cannot be confirmed without decoding, the indicators suggest high malicious potential. The package should be treated as high risk, and further analysis of the encoded command is recommended.",
