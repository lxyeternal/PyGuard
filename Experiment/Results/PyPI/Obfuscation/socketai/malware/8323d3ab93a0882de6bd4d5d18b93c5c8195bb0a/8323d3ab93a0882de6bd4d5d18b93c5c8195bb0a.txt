      "conclusion": "The code exhibits behaviors characteristic of malicious payloads, notably executing an encoded PowerShell command in stealth mode. While the exact payload cannot be confirmed without decoding, the indicators suggest high malicious potential. The package should be treated as high risk, and further analysis of the encoded command is recommended."
