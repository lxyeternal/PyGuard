  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code reading input data, dynamic execution (eval), variable assignments, data processing routines.",
  "sinks": "Potential network connections, file operations, data exfiltration points, dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Input sources to data processing functions, eval to dynamic code execution, data to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval, obfuscated variable names, dynamic code execution, lack of clear purpose in some snippets.",
  "analysis": "Most reports describe benign code with no suspicious patterns, high confidence in safety, and low risk scores. Report 2 notes obfuscation and eval, which are red flags, but no malicious payloads are confirmed. Adjustments suggest increasing malware score in report 2 from 0.1 to 0.2 to better reflect potential risks associated with obfuscation and dynamic execution. Other reports are consistent with benign code. Overall, the assessment aligns with code features, with cautious scoring in presence of obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears mostly benign across reports, with a slight increase in malware risk score for report 2 due to obfuscation and eval. The overall security posture remains low risk, but monitoring obfuscated code is advisable. Final scores: malware=0.2, obfuscated=0.7, securityRisk=0.2.",
