{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for a standard Python package with no immediately obvious malicious intent. It seems to import common libraries and set up typical functions.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly present; there are no functions reading user input, files, or environment variables. The code imports modules but does not show data being fetched from untrusted sources.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks are present where untrusted data flows into dangerous functions like network calls, system commands, or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "flows": "There are no identifiable source-to-sink data flows; the code mainly performs definitions and imports without processing external input.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are detected. The code structure is typical for a Python package setup or module.",
  "analysis": "The code does not contain visible input handling, network activity, or obfuscated parts. It imports standard modules and sets up functions in a conventional manner. There is no evidence of malicious payloads, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior. Without additional context or more code, it appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It looks like a standard, benign Python module setup. Confidence is high in this assessment, with no detected obfuscation or malware indicators.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
