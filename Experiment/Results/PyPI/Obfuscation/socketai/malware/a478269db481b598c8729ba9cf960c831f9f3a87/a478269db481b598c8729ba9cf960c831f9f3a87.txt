      "conclusion": "The code is highly malicious, obfuscated to evade detection, and capable of executing system-level operations that could compromise security. It performs privilege escalation, package manipulation, file operations, and system modifications, all indicative of malicious activity. It should be considered dangerous and untrusted in any supply chain context."

      "conclusion": "The code appears mostly benign across reports, with a slight increase in malware risk score for report 2 due to obfuscation and eval. The overall security posture remains low risk, but monitoring obfuscated code is advisable. Final scores: malware=0.2, obfuscated=0.7, securityRisk=0.2."
