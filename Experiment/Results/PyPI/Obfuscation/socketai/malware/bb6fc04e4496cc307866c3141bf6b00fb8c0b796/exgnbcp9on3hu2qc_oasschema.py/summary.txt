  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate JSON schema validation with obfuscated method calls. There is no direct evidence of malicious payloads or external malicious activity. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. The malware score remains low (0.2), and the security risk is moderate (0.4). Further investigation into the custom method is recommended to rule out malicious extensions."
