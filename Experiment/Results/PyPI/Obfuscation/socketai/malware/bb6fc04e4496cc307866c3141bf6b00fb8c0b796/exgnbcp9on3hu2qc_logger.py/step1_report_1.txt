{
  "purpose": "Provide styled error and informational messages to the console",
  "sources": "The code reads input data through the print statements which output to stderr and stdout",
  "sinks": "The print functions output data to the console; no external data sinks are involved",
  "flows": "Input data (string arguments) flow into print statements for error and info messages, then are output to console",
  "anomalies": "The class name and method names appear obfuscated or randomly generated, which could be an anomaly; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with two static methods for printing styled messages using the termcolor library. It does not perform any data processing, input reading, or network activity. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious actions are present. The obfuscated-looking class and method names are unusual but do not constitute malicious activity. The code is straightforward and only outputs messages to the console.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple utility for styled logging messages. There is no malicious behavior or security risk identified. The obfuscated naming might be a concern for code clarity but does not indicate malicious intent.",
