  "purpose": "Utility class for styled console messaging (error and info logs).",
  "sources": "Method arguments providing message strings.",
  "sinks": "Console output via print statements styled with termcolor.",
  "flows": "Input strings passed to static methods, then printed with styling.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names; no other unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple logging utility with two static methods for printing styled messages. It uses 'termcolor' for colored output. No input validation, network activity, or data handling occurs. The class and method names are obfuscated, which is unusual but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious code are present. The code's functionality is benign, serving only to output styled messages to stderr or stdout.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for styled logging with obfuscated identifiers. No malicious activity or security vulnerabilities are evident. The obfuscation affects readability but does not imply malicious intent. The scores reflect this: malware score of 0, obfuscation score around 0.75, and a very low security risk score (~0.1).",
