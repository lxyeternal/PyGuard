{
  "purpose": "The code defines a utility class for printing colored error and info messages to the standard error and output streams.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only defines a class with static methods.",
  "targets": "There are no data sinks or untrusted data handling in the code; it merely outputs predefined messages.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the methods are called with explicit string arguments.",
  "anomalies": "Class name is obfuscated and unusual; methods have non-descriptive, seemingly random names. The code uses third-party library 'termcolor' but in itself does not perform any malicious actions. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides static methods for printing error and info messages with colored formatting. No input handling, no data processing, no network operations. The obfuscated class and method names might be suspicious but could also be intentionally obscured for obfuscation or stylistic reasons. No malicious or security-risk behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign utility for colored logging. No malicious intent or security risks are evident based on the provided code.",
