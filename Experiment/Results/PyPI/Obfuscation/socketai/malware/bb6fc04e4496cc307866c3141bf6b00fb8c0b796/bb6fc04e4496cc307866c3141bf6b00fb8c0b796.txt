      "conclusion": "The code primarily implements structured exception handling with logging, but the heavy obfuscation and dynamic override mechanisms introduce suspicion. There is no concrete malicious activity detected, but the obfuscation and override capabilities could be exploited if controlled by an attacker. Overall, the code warrants cautious review but does not constitute confirmed malware."

The obfuscation is superficial and does not impact security. The overall assessment indicates a low security threat with no malicious intent."

The obfuscation warrants attention but does not indicate malicious intent. The overall security risk is minimal, and the code can be considered safe."

While obfuscation and broad exception handling are present, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain compromise. The low malware score is appropriate, with some moderate concern over input validation practices."

The pattern of remote code execution, obfuscation, and dynamic route registration confirms a severe security threat. It should be classified as malware with maximum severity."

The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. The malware score remains low (0.2), and the security risk is moderate (0.4). Further investigation into the custom method is recommended to rule out malicious extensions."
