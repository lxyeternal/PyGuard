  "purpose": "A configuration loader class that reads and manages YAML configuration files for an application.",
  "sources": "Reading configuration file 'conf/config.yaml' or a specified filename; reading file contents with open()",
  "sinks": "Updating internal dictionary with loaded config data; raising exceptions; logging messages",
  "flows": "Open file -> yaml.load() -> update internal config dictionary -> possible exception or log",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic string formatting for logs and error messages; no hardcoded credentials or secret values observed; no suspicious code or obfuscated constructs",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class that loads configuration data from a YAML file, storing it in an internal dictionary. It logs success messages and handles missing files by raising an exception. No external or untrusted data sources are processed; the YAML parsing uses standard functions; no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. The code appears straightforward, with no obfuscated code, suspicious network activity, or hardcoded secrets. The logging function name appears deliberately complex but not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration loader with no signs of malicious intent or malware. It manages configuration data securely without exposing secrets or performing harmful actions. There are no anomalies or malicious patterns detected.",
