  "purpose": "Configuration loader that reads a YAML file, stores data in an internal dictionary, and provides access methods.",
  "sources": "File open/read operations, YAML parsing, class initialization.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or network operations; data is stored locally.",
  "flows": "Reading YAML file -> updating internal dictionary -> access via getter methods.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names, use of a custom YAML loader method name, no clear secrets or credentials.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a configuration loader with obfuscated identifiers, which raises suspicion but no malicious activity is evident. It does not perform network operations, code injection, or system modifications. The YAML parsing is straightforward, and no secrets or credentials are hardcoded. The obfuscation appears superficial, likely for concealment, but does not imply malicious intent. The exception handling for missing files is standard. Overall, the code is benign but obfuscated.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration loader with obfuscated naming, no signs of malware or malicious behavior. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not indicate malicious intent. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is high (0.7), and overall security risk is low (0.2).",
