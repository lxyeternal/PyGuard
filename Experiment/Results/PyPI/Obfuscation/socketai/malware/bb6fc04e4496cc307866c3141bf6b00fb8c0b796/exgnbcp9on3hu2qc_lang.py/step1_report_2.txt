{
  "purpose": "Selects an accepted language based on the available languages and request headers.",
  "sources": "request.accept_languages.values() - reads the client's Accept-Language header.",
  "sinks": "Return statement outputs the selected language code, potentially influencing response language.",
  "flows": "Request header data flows into language selection logic, which then returns a language code.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears obfuscated with random class and method names, but no malicious payloads or suspicious operations are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'request' from Flask and defines a class with a static method that inspects the client's 'Accept-Language' headers. It checks if the full language code or its first two characters are in the list of available languages, returning the match or a default value. There is no evidence of data exfiltration, code injection, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior. The obfuscated naming suggests concealment but does not indicate malicious intent. The code solely performs language negotiation.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements standard language negotiation logic with obfuscated identifiers. There is no sign of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a benign utility function.",
