  "purpose": "Custom JSON serialization for objects including ObjectId and datetime objects.",
  "sources": "Input data passed to the llRDCRjMoAQzJFagwZZVAVALbzKaFCzz function.",
  "sinks": "json.dumps output, which could potentially expose serialized data if misused.",
  "flows": "Data from input flows into json.dumps, with custom encoding handling ObjectId and datetime.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class and function names; no clear external inputs, no network or file operations, no hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom JSON encoder class that serializes ObjectId and datetime objects into string formats. The function wraps json.dumps with this custom encoder. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration observed. The obfuscated names suggest an attempt to conceal intent but do not inherently indicate malicious behavior. The code's purpose appears benign and limited to data serialization.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard data serialization with custom handling for specific object types. No malicious behavior or security risks detected. The obfuscation is suspicious but not malicious in itself. Overall, this code appears safe and non-malicious.",
