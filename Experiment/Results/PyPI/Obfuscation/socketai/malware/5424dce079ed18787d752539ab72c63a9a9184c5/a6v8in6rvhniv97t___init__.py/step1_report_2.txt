  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a Python script for data processing or utility functions, with no clear indication of malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, potentially user inputs, and imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Data output functions, network connections, or file writing operations could be sinks; specific details depend on code segments, such as print statements, network calls, or file access.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (input/env variables) through processing functions to sinks (output, network, files).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious imports; no obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic execution detected; no unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed for typical security issues such as hardcoded secrets, malicious network activity, or data leaks. The structure and content do not reveal any malicious behavior or malicious code patterns. The code uses standard libraries and functions with no signs of obfuscation or hidden backdoors. No suspicious input/output flows were identified. Overall, the code appears benign based on the provided snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks based on current analysis. It seems to serve its intended purpose without security concerns.",
