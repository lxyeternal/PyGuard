{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform benign data processing or system interactions without malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input data sources, environment variables, standard input/output functions, or internal variables.",
  "sinks": "Output functions, environment variables, or system calls that could potentially leak data or affect system state.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) to sinks (outputs or system calls) without suspicious transformations or external communications.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code shows no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports consistently assign malware=0 and obfuscated=0, with low risk scores (0.1-0.3) reflecting cautious but benign assessments. Confidence levels are high (0.7-0.9), indicating trust in the benign nature. No suspicious data flows or anomalies are observed. The overall pattern suggests a safe, standard codebase with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is benign with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk is very low, and the malware score should be set to 0. The overall confidence in this assessment is high.",
