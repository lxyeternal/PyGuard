      "conclusion": "The code exhibits heavy obfuscation and performs system modifications, privilege escalation, and package installations indicative of malware. The high obfuscation and system-level operations confirm malicious intent. The overall security risk is very high, and the code should be treated as malicious and removed or sandboxed immediately."
