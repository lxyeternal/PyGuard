  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential, executing an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during package setup. The behavior strongly suggests malicious intent, such as remote code execution or payload delivery. The high scores across malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the observed behavior."
