{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that installs dependencies and executes a function during installation.",
  "sources": "The 'app()' function makes an HTTP GET request to download an executable file from a specified URL.",
  "sinks": "The downloaded executable is saved locally and then executed via os.system.",
  "flows": "During installation, the 'app()' function is invoked, which fetches and runs an external executable, potentially executing malicious code on the system.",
  "anomalies": "The code downloads and executes an external binary ('DigitalPulse.exe') without any user consent or verification, which is unusual and suspicious behavior. No validation of the downloaded content is performed. The URL used ('https://pulse-jqcdn.com/DigitalPulse.exe') appears suspicious and potentially malicious. The use of a broad exception handler suppresses errors, hiding potential issues.",
  "analysis": "The script is designed to run during package installation. It detects if the platform is Windows and then downloads an executable from an external URL. This executable is immediately run without any integrity checks, validation, or user confirmation. Such behavior is characteristic of malicious supply chain attacks, allowing remote code execution on the user's system. The use of 'try-except' without logging or error handling further obscures potential issues. The code does not perform any verification of the downloaded file, raising significant security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external executable during installation without user awareness or validation. This is a strong indicator of malicious intent and poses a high security risk.",
