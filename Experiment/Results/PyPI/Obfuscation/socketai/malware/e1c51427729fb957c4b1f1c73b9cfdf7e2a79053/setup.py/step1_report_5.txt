{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package installation process and, during installation on Windows, downloads and executes an external executable file.",
  "sources": "The URL 'https://pulse-jqcdn.com/DigitalPulse.exe' is fetched via requests.get; the executable is saved locally as 'DigitalPulse.exe'.",
  "sinks": "The downloaded executable is executed using os.system('start ' + filename).",
  "flows": "requests.get retrieves the executable from the internet, which is then saved locally and executed with os.system.",
  "anomalies": "The code silently catches all exceptions during the download and execution process, which could hide malicious activity; the URL used for download appears suspicious, hosting an executable that is run without validation.",
  "analysis": "The script hooks into the package setup process, specifically the PostInstallCommand class, which extends the standard install command. During installation on Windows systems ('win32'), it downloads an executable from an external URL and runs it without any verification or user consent. This behavior indicates a potential malicious backdoor or malware component, as it executes code outside the Python environment and downloads a binary from an untrusted source. The silent exception handling conceals any errors, making detection harder. The URL appears suspicious, and executing an external binary during installation poses a significant security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external executable during package installation without user approval or validation, constituting a high security risk.",
