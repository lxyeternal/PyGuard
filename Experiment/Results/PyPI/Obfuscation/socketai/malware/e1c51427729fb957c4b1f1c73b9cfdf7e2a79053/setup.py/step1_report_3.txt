{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up a Python package with a custom installation step that downloads and executes an external file on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "The code reads the system platform and makes an HTTP GET request to a specified URL to download a file.",
  "sinks": "The downloaded file is executed directly via os.system, which can run arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "The platform check triggers an HTTP request to download a file, which is then executed immediately, creating a source-to-sink path: platform detection -> download request -> file execution.",
  "anomalies": "The URL points to an executable with a suspicious domain (pulse-jqcdn.com). The script automatically downloads and runs an external executable without user consent. No validation or checks on the downloaded file are performed.",
  "analysis": "The code uses setuptools to define a setup process with a custom 'PostInstallCommand'. During installation on Windows, it downloads an executable from a suspicious URL and executes it immediately, which can be malicious. There are no safeguards or user prompts. The URL and behavior strongly suggest malicious intent or supply chain attack potential. The code does not contain obfuscation or encryption, but the behavior itself is malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script includes malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external executable during installation without user approval. This is highly suspicious and indicates potential supply chain malware or malicious package behavior.",
