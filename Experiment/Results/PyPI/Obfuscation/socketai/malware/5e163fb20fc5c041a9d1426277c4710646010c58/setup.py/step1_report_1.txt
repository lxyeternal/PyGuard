{
  "purpose": "The code is setting up a Python package with specified metadata and attempting to execute a hidden PowerShell command if a certain directory does not exist.",
  "sources": "os.path.exists('tahg') check; subprocess.Popen call with encoded PowerShell command",
  "sinks": "subprocess.Popen executes a potentially malicious PowerShell command, which may run arbitrary code without user awareness",
  "flows": "If 'tahg' does not exist, subprocess.Popen runs encoded PowerShell command; this occurs during setup execution",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64-encoded PowerShell command executed with hidden window; no clear purpose for this command; try-except blocks suppress errors silently",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup utilities and conditionally executes a hidden PowerShell command encoded in base64, likely to conceal malicious activity. The encoded command appears to be obfuscated, and its purpose is unclear, but such techniques are often used to run malicious code covertly. The setup function defines package metadata. The silent exception handling further hides any errors, potentially masking malicious activity. The code resembles malicious tactics such as covert command execution during package installation, which is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a hidden, encoded PowerShell command that executes silently during package setup, indicating malicious intent. The obfuscated command and suppression of errors suggest attempts at concealment. Overall, this code poses a significant security risk.",
