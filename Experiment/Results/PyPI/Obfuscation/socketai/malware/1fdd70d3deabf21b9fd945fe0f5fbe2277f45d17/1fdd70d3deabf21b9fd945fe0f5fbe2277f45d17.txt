      "conclusion": "Overall, the majority of the code appears benign with appropriate low malware and obfuscation scores. Report 5's patterns suggest moderate suspicion; scores should be adjusted upward to better reflect potential risk. The supply chain risk remains low for most, but vigilance is advised for code exhibiting obfuscation and dynamic behavior."
