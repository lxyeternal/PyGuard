{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be the definition of a utility function or class, likely for data processing or manipulation within a larger application.",
  "sources": "Reads data from standard input, environment variables, or package resources; specifics are unclear due to the absence of explicit input functions or data sources.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes data to files, network sockets, or system commands; however, no explicit sink points are evident from the provided code.",
  "flows": "Data flow is unclear due to limited code context; no explicit source-to-sink paths are observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious URL calls, or obfuscated code detected. The code structure and variables seem standard. The code is minimal, making it difficult to identify malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code fragment is minimal and appears to contain a utility function or class definition with no visible input/output operations, external network calls, or embedded malicious logic. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are evident. Without further context or additional code, the analysis remains limited to surface-level review.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no clear signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems benign, but the lack of broader context limits confidence in this assessment.",
  "confidence": 0.6,
  "obfuscated": 0,
