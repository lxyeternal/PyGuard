  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Code snippets, patterns indicating obfuscation, dynamic execution, external interactions, hardcoded secrets, network calls, input/output points.",
  "sinks": "External network connections, file operations, environment variable access, dynamic code execution points, data leaks.",
  "flows": "Sources such as external inputs or environment variables to sinks like network or file operations, potentially via dynamic execution or obfuscated code.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscation patterns, dynamic code execution functions (eval, exec), suspicious external interactions, hardcoded secrets, unusual variable naming or code structure.",
  "analysis": "Most reports indicate benign, minimal code with no suspicious patterns, consistent scoring, and high confidence in benign nature. Report 5 describes obfuscation and dynamic code execution, which are typical indicators of potential malicious intent. The malware score in Report 5 is currently low (0.2), but given the suspicious patterns, it should be increased to approximately 0.5. Obfuscation score of 0.4 is justified; risk score of 0.4–0.6 reflects moderate concern. Other reports are consistent with benign assessments; minor adjustments to risk scores could be considered but are not necessary.",
  "conclusion": "Overall, the majority of the code appears benign with appropriate low malware and obfuscation scores. Report 5's patterns suggest moderate suspicion; scores should be adjusted upward to better reflect potential risk. The supply chain risk remains low for most, but vigilance is advised for code exhibiting obfuscation and dynamic behavior.",
