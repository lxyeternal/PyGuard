  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly clear due to lack of comments or documentation; it appears to be an import and setup script possibly for a larger application.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from environment variables and local modules; no external data sources are explicitly referenced.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include network connections or file operations if present later, but in the provided snippet, no direct sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to importing modules and fetching environment variables; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks are observable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic code execution are detected in this snippet. The code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet mainly consists of import statements and fetching environment variables. No network connections, file manipulations, or dynamic code execution are present. The absence of sensitive data handling or malicious patterns suggests no malicious intent. The structure is simple and adheres to standard Python practices.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain sabotage, or security risks. The code appears benign and typical for a setup or configuration module.",
