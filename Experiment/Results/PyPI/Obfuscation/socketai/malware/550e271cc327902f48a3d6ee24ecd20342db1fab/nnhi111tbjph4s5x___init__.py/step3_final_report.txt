  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, network communication, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), input/output functions, import statements.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, file writes, system commands, data exfiltration points, dynamic code execution paths.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or untrusted input to sinks like network transmission, file operations, or eval/exec functions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec with untrusted data, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated variable names, suspicious network activity, dynamic imports, suspicious patterns in code structure.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits behaviors such as dynamic code execution, obfuscation, and network communication to suspicious domains, indicating malicious intent. Benign code lacks such patterns. Scores assigned in reports align with these indicators, with high malware and obfuscation scores justified in reports 2 and 3, and low or zero scores in benign reports 1, 4, and 5. The confidence levels reflect the clarity of indicators. No false positives or unnecessary warnings are present.",
  "conclusion": "The reports' assessments and scores are consistent and justified based on the described behaviors. High suspicion in reports 2 and 3 is supported by indicators of obfuscation and malicious activity. Benign reports correctly show minimal or no risk. No revisions are necessary; the overall evaluation accurately reflects the code's security posture.",
