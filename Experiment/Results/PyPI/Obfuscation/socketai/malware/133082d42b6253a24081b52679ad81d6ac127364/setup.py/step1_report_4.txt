{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be setting up a Python package and potentially executing a hidden PowerShell command during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the filesystem to check for the existence of the 'tahg' directory and executes a PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen call executes a PowerShell command encoded in base64, which could perform arbitrary actions, potentially malicious.",
  "flows": "Filesystem check (source) -> Conditional execution -> PowerShell command (sink).",
  "anomalies": "The PowerShell command is encoded, likely to hide its true intent. The command runs with hidden window style, which suggests an attempt to conceal activity. The use of try-except blocks with broad exception handling suppresses errors, potentially hiding malicious failures.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by importing setup from distutils and attempting to import subprocess and os modules. It checks if a directory 'tahg' exists; if not, it executes a PowerShell command encoded in base64, run with hidden window style to avoid user detection. The PowerShell command itself is obfuscated, making it suspicious. The code then proceeds to call setup() with package metadata, wrapped in a try-except block that suppresses exceptions. The hidden execution of a possibly malicious PowerShell script during package installation indicates malicious intent or sabotage, especially given the encoding and window suppression.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign setup process but includes a hidden, obfuscated PowerShell command that could execute malicious actions. This behavior is suspicious and suggests the package may contain malicious code designed to execute arbitrary commands stealthily during installation.",
