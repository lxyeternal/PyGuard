{
  "purpose": "The code is used to define and configure a Python package setup, including its name and version.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package name and version from the arguments provided to 'setup()'.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks or untrusted data flows; the code primarily imports and calls setup functions.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows are present; the setup parameters are static strings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code are evident. The package name appears random, but that alone is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setup' and 'find_packages' from 'setuptools' and calls 'setup()' with fixed arguments. There are no user inputs, external data sources, or dynamic behaviors. The package name is unusual but does not indicate malicious intent. The code is minimal and straightforward, performing a standard package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The package name is non-descriptive but not inherently malicious. No malware or security risks detected.",
