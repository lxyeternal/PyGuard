{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a collection of utility classes and functions for terminal manipulation, including screen clearing, cursor visibility, text coloring, and animated effects, likely intended for creating stylized terminal interfaces or developer tools.",
  "sources": "Input is read via standard input functions within specific methods (e.g., wlHRRJTpjJYehUTFYlPcgPJHoPeYFlIY, tJaFlZPbGwEdzqbbXdnWqptTBUtAsHDn, wWRIXeeljelVHglWvlbUbXQXuycRVHaQ), as well as terminal size queries. Data flows from user input and terminal state queries.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe data concatenation and printing to stdout (via print and _stdout.write) can be manipulated to produce malicious terminal output or visual deception. Functions constructing terminal UI components do not directly write untrusted data, but can be used to obfuscate or mimic malicious UI overlays. No network or system command execution directly observed.",
  "flows": "Sources include user inputs and terminal size queries; sinks are stdout writes and print statements. The code can flow from user input through various display functions that render styled or animated terminal outputs, but no external network or file system actions are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The presence of many intentionally obfuscated class and variable names, unused variables, and functions with complex logic but no clear functional purpose suggest possible obfuscation. The class 'developper area' comment hints at a developer-only or hidden section. Some functions perform repetitive string manipulations that could be used for disguising behavior. No hardcoded credentials or obvious backdoors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code predominantly provides terminal UI utilities: clearing the screen, hiding/showing cursor, text coloring, animated spinners, and custom banners. There are no system calls, network operations, or data exfiltration code. Obfuscation is suggested by the naming conventions and some unused code snippets. Functions like 'wlHRRJTpjJYehUTFYlPcgPJHoPeYFlIY' and others manipulate terminal output with delays, likely for visual effects. No evidence of malicious payloads or external communication mechanisms. The overall structure appears to be a sophisticated terminal UI toolkit, potentially used for malicious purposes if combined with deceptive overlays, but on its own, it does not perform malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a terminal UI utility library with obfuscated identifiers and complex string manipulations. No active malicious behavior, network activity, or data exfiltration is present. The obfuscation could be used to conceal malicious intent if misused, but based on the provided code, it appears to be a legitimate UI toolkit. The malware score is low, and security risks are minimal. Confidence score is high due to the nature of the analysis.",
