{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up a Python package but contains embedded malicious payloads executed during import, which perform network requests to external IPs and execute obfuscated code.",
  "sources": "Base64-encoded string decoded and compiled during import, network requests to IP '20.224.2.213', and dynamic execution of decoded code.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decoded code via exec(), network requests to external IPs, potential download or execution of malicious payloads.",
  "flows": "Base64 string decoded, compiled, and executed via exec() during import; network requests made to suspicious IPs; possibly downloads and executes further malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated base64 payload decoded and executed at import time, network requests to suspicious IP addresses, code executed before setup() call, use of compile and exec for dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools, then performs obfuscated operations: imports builtins, decodes a base64 string, compiles, and executes it via exec(). The decoded payload involves network requests to IP '20.224.2.213' and likely downloads or executes malicious code. This pattern indicates malicious intent, obfuscation, and remote control capabilities. The setup() call appears benign but is compromised by the embedded payload. The obfuscation and network activity strongly suggest malicious behavior, with high potential for remote code execution and data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains highly obfuscated, malicious payloads that execute during import, making network requests to suspicious IPs. The behavior indicates a high probability of malicious activity, including remote code execution and data theft. The scores should reflect this high threat level.",
