{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package named 'zc03q4bucq55tpf7' with specific metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from a base64-encoded string executed via dynamic import and compile, which then executes code during import.",
  "sinks": "The dynamically decoded and executed code can lead to remote code execution, data exfiltration, or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Base64 string is decoded and compiled, then executed, which likely contains malicious code. This execution flows into package setup, potentially hiding malicious behavior.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses obfuscated base64 decoding and dynamic execution, which are common signs of malicious or obfuscated code. It executes code immediately upon import, which is unusual for standard setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with a normal import from setuptools and a print statement. It then imports modules and executes a base64-encoded string via compile and exec, which indicates obfuscation. The encoded payload, when decoded, appears to perform a dynamic import of 'NamedTemporaryFile' and 'urllib.request', and executes a network request to an IP address ('20.224.2.213') over HTTP. The presence of such network activity, combined with obfuscation and dynamic code execution, strongly suggests malicious intent, such as data exfiltration or remote command execution. The setup call at the end is standard, but the obfuscated payload runs before setup and is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated and dynamically executed payload that makes a network request, indicating malicious intent likely aimed at data exfiltration or remote control. The setup script itself appears legitimate but is compromised by the embedded malicious code.",
