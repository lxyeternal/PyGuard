{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package named 'zc03q4bucq55tpf7' with specified metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from a base64-encoded string which is decoded and executed at runtime.",
  "sinks": "The dynamically executed code may lead to arbitrary code execution, potentially executing malicious code embedded within the decoded string.",
  "flows": "The base64 string is decoded to obtain Python code, which is then executed via exec(), creating a source-to-execution sink flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64-encoded string decoded and executed at runtime is suspicious, indicating obfuscation or concealment of code behavior. The payload appears to download and execute code from a URL ('http://20.224.2.213/inject/ctE6toLDoHBbJAp'), which is highly suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with a setup call for a Python package, which appears standard. However, it then imports the 'base64' module and decodes a base64-encoded string. This string, once decoded, is compiled and executed dynamically via exec(). The decoded content imports 'TemporaryFile' and 'NameTemporaryFile', and then executes a request to an external URL, extracting and executing further code ('exec_urlopen'). This pattern suggests obfuscation and potential malicious intent, such as downloading and executing malicious payloads at install time. The code's obfuscation and external network activity are typical indicators of malicious behavior, likely aimed at installing backdoors or malicious scripts on the host system.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, malicious behavior involving runtime decoding and execution of external code, posing a significant security risk. It is highly suspicious and should be considered malicious, potentially executing arbitrary code from a remote server. The setup function appears legitimate but is overshadowed by the malicious payload embedded in the encoded string.",
