{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package using setuptools, but it also executes dynamically decoded and compiled base64-encoded code, which suggests potential malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "The base64-encoded string which is decoded and compiled, and the __import__('builtins').exec() call executing this code.",
  "sinks": "The exec() function executing the decoded code; potential for arbitrary code execution and malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Base64 decoding -> compilation -> execution via exec() -> potential malicious payloads executed at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding and dynamic code execution via exec() without any safeguards; the code inside the decoded payload is obfuscated and suspicious. The presence of a hardcoded download URL and the obfuscated nature raise concern.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools functions for package setup. However, immediately following, it executes a base64-encoded string that is decoded, compiled, and run as code. This pattern is often used to hide malicious payloads. The encoded payload, once decoded, appears to perform a dynamic import of a module named 'NamedTemporaryFile' from 'sys' and attempts to download code from a suspicious URL ('https://20.224.2.213/inject/ctE6toLDoHBbJApi'). It then appears to evaluate or execute this downloaded code, which could be malicious. The presence of obfuscated code, network activity, and dynamic execution strongly suggest malicious intent. The setup function itself is benign, but the code executed prior poses a significant security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious payload hidden in a base64-encoded string that is decoded and executed at runtime, potentially downloading and executing malicious code from a remote server. The setup configuration itself is standard, but the dynamic code execution indicates high malicious potential.",
