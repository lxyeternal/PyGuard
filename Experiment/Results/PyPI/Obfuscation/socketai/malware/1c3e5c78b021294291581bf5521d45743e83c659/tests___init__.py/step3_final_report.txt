  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Use of eval/exec, hardcoded secrets, environment variables, external network interactions, import statements.",
  "sinks": "Data leaks via environment variables, network connections, code execution points, file operations.",
  "flows": "Sources such as untrusted input or secrets flow into eval/exec, network functions, or data handling, potentially leading to malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval/exec, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation techniques, suspicious external interactions, minimal or no code in some reports.",
  "analysis": "The reports with suspicious patterns (reports 2 and 3) show indicators like eval/exec, hardcoded secrets, and obfuscation, justifying higher malware and risk scores. Benign reports (1, 4, 5) lack such patterns; their scores are appropriate but could be slightly lowered for confidence. The scores align with the described anomalies, with minor adjustments recommended for benign cases. Overall, the scoring reflects the suspicion level and evidence presented.",
  "conclusion": "The reports are generally consistent with their analyses. Suspicious reports (2 and 3) have justified higher scores, while benign reports (1, 4, 5) are correctly scored as low risk. Minor score adjustments improve alignment with evidence, but current assessments are reasonable.",
