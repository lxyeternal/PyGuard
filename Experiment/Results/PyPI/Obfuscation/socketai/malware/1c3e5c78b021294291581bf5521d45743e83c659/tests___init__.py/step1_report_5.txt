  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be the importation and utilization of various modules, potentially for data processing, system operations, or network communication, but the specific intent is unclear without more context.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the imported modules, environment variables, or possibly external data sources, but no explicit input sources are shown in the snippet provided.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, system commands, or data storage mechanisms if present later in the code; however, the snippet does not show direct dangerous sinks like system calls or network transmissions.",
  "flows": "No clear source-to-sink data flows are visible in the provided code snippet; further code is needed to trace data movement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is incomplete; no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious functions, or obfuscated code are evident in the provided fragment. The snippet mainly contains import statements with no malicious indicators.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements without any executable logic, functions, or data handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or anomalies. Without further code, it is impossible to identify suspicious flows or malicious intent. The code appears benign at this stage.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is incomplete, and no suspicious activity is evident. It is recommended to review the entire codebase for comprehensive assessment.",
