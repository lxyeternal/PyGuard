      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code contains highly obfuscated, malicious payloads that execute during import, making network requests to suspicious IPs. The behavior indicates a high probability of malicious activity, including remote code execution and data theft. The scores should reflect this high threat level."

      "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a non-malicious, obfuscated API client for GitHub with no signs of malware or malicious behavior. The primary concerns are obfuscation and lack of validation, which could be exploited if inputs are malicious, but these do not elevate the code to malicious status. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent and justified based on the code's behavior."

      "conclusion": "The reports are generally consistent with their analyses. Suspicious reports (2 and 3) have justified higher scores, while benign reports (1, 4, 5) are correctly scored as low risk. Minor score adjustments improve alignment with evidence, but current assessments are reasonable."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be an obfuscated test suite for a GitHub API wrapper, with no direct malicious actions or security threats evident. Obfuscation and silent error handling are suspicious but not definitive. Overall, the code is benign but warrants further review of the imported module for hidden malicious behavior."
