  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a network utility with significant obfuscation. While the obfuscation warrants caution, there is no direct evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The high obfuscation is a concern but not definitive of malicious intent. The scores assigned across reports are reasonable and align with the analysis. Continued monitoring and full context review are recommended if used in security-sensitive environments."
