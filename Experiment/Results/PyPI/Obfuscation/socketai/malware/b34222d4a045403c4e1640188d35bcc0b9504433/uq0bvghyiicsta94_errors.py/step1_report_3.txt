{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes, mostly inheriting from a generic exception class, likely for specific error handling.",
  "sources": "No input or external data sources are used in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data output, no untrusted data handling, and no sinks present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows, input/output, or exception handling flows to analyze.",
  "anomalies": "All classes are simply subclassed exceptions with no additional logic, no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. No dynamic code execution or external calls are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exception types, with no logic, data handling, or external interactions. The naming appears obfuscated, but that alone is not malicious. No signs of code injection, data leakage, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code appears to be standard exception class declarations, possibly auto-generated or deliberately obfuscated naming, but lacking any harmful behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains only harmless exception class definitions with no malicious intent, no data flow, and no security risks identified. It appears to be a standard pattern for custom exceptions, with obfuscated class names but no malicious behavior.",
