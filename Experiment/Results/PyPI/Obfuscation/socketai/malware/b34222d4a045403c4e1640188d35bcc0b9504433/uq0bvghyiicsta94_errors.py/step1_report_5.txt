{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes, mostly inheriting from built-in exception types, with no additional behavior.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and inheritance declarations, no input or data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling points detected.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; classes are simply declared without execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "Class names are obfuscated and nonsensical, suggesting potential concealment or attempt to hide intent. No functional code or operations are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of multiple custom exception class definitions, many inheriting from a base exception class with similar obfuscated names, and a few inheriting from built-in exceptions like OSError. No functions, method calls, data handling, or external interactions are included. The obfuscated class names may be intended to obscure purpose or mislead. There is no apparent malicious activity such as network communication, file access, or code execution. The code appears to serve as a placeholder or obfuscation rather than malicious payload.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains only obfuscated class declarations with no executable logic, data handling, or external interactions. While obfuscated names can sometimes be suspicious, in this context, there is no evidence of malicious behavior. The overall security risk is low, but the obfuscation warrants caution as it could be used to hide malicious intent if integrated into a larger codebase.",
