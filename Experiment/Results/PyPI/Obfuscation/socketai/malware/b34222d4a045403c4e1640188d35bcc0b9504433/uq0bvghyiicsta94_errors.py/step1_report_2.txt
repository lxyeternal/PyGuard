  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for specific error handling scenarios.",
  "sources": "No input or external data sources are read; the code solely defines classes.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present, as there are only class definitions with no instantiation or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Class names are nonsensical and appear randomly generated, with no meaningful identifiers or logic. No code performs operations beyond class inheritance.",
  "analysis": "The code exclusively consists of class definitions inheriting from built-in exceptions, with no methods, attributes, or logic. Class names are obfuscated or randomly generated, suggesting no functional purpose. There are no input sources, data processing, or external communication. The absence of operational code indicates no malicious activity or suspicious behavior. The code appears to be filler or placeholder definitions, not executing any harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code defines several custom exception classes with obfuscated names, but contains no executable logic, data handling, or external interactions. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks within this code fragment.",
