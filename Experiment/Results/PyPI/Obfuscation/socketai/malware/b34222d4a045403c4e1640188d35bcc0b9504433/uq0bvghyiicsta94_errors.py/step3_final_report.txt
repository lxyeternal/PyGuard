  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes with obfuscated names; no external data or logic.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from Exception or OSError, class name assignments.",
  "sinks": "No data flows, external inputs, or outputs; no sinks present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; code contains only class declarations.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class names, no logic or data processing, only placeholder exception classes.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class declarations with obfuscated names inheriting from standard exception classes. There is no logic, data handling, or external communication. The high obfuscation scores are justified given the nonsensical class names. No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or active vulnerabilities are present. The malware score should be 0, as no malicious activity is evident. The obfuscation score is high (around 0.8-1), justified by the class names. The security risk score is very low (around 0.1-0.2), reflecting the benign nature of the code. The confidence in this assessment is high (above 0.8).",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of obfuscated exception class definitions with no active malicious behavior. The high obfuscation warrants caution in broader contexts but, in isolation, poses no security threat. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
