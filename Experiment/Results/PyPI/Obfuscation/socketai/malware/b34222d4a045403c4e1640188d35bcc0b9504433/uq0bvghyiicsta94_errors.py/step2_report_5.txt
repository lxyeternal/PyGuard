  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** The code only defines obfuscated exception classes with no logic, data processing, or external interactions. No data flows, sinks, or active behavior. The obfuscation is suspicious but benign in isolation.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 — aligns with no malicious activity.\n  - Obfuscated: 0.9 — justified given the obfuscated class names.\n  - SecurityRisk: 0.1 — reasonable, as the code itself is benign but obfuscation can be suspicious.\n\n**Assessment:** The scores seem appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to Report 1, just class definitions with obfuscated names. No logic or data handling. The obfuscation is complete (obfuscated=1), which is slightly higher than Report 1, but justified.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 — correct.\n  - Obfuscated: 1 — justified.\n  - SecurityRisk: 0 — appropriate, as no active risk.\n\n**Assessment:** The scores are consistent. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same pattern—only class declarations, no logic, data, or external communication. Obfuscation is high but no malicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 — correct.\n  - Obfuscated: 0.8 — consistent with obfuscation.\n  - SecurityRisk: 0 — justified.\n\n**Assessment:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Again, only class definitions with no active behavior. Obfuscation is moderate to high, but no malicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 — correct.\n  - Obfuscated: 0.8 — justified.\n  - SecurityRisk: 0.1 — acceptable.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same pattern—obfuscated class names, no logic, no data flow, no active code. Obfuscation is noted as 0.8, which is justified.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 — correct.\n  - Obfuscated: 0.8 — justified.\n  - SecurityRisk: 0.2 — slightly higher but still reasonable, considering obfuscation.\n\n**Assessment:** The scores seem consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify that the code only contains class declarations for custom exceptions with obfuscated names. No logic, data flow, or active behavior is present.\n\n- **Malware Score:** All are correctly set to 0, as there is no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** High (0.8-1), justified due to the obfuscated class names.\n\n- **Security Risk:** Very low (0-0.2), appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code analysis.\n\n- The obfuscation, while suspicious, does not currently translate into a security risk or malware presence.\n\n- No changes are necessary to the scoring based on the provided code and analysis.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\nConsidering the entire code fragment and reports, I would assign:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.8 — high obfuscation, consistent with class names.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, mainly due to obfuscation but no active threat.\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** While the code appears harmless, persistent obfuscation can sometimes hide malicious intent in larger contexts. Continuous monitoring and context-aware analysis are recommended.",
