{
  "purpose": "Define multiple custom exception classes, primarily inheriting from built-in exception types.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and inheritance statements; no input or data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No apparent untrusted data handling or potential data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; purely class inheritance without data processing.",
  "anomalies": "All classes are empty and only define exception types; no logic, no data handling, no suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class declarations for custom exception types, inheriting from standard exceptions like Exception and OSError. There are no functions, no data manipulation, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, or network operations. The naming appears obfuscated, but that alone does not indicate malicious intent. The code appears to be a set of custom exception class definitions, likely used elsewhere in a larger codebase. No signs of malware, malicious code, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and serves to define custom exception classes, with no malicious behavior or security issues detected.",
