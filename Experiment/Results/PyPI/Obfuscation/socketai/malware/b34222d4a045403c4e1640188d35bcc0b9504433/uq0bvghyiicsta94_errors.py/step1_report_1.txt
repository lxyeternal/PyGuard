{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes, mostly inheriting from built-in exception types.",
  "sources": "Class definitions that inherit from Exception or OSError, no external input or data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or potentially leaked.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code consists solely of class declarations.",
  "anomalies": "Class names are obfuscated and appear random; no functional code or logic present; no clear purpose beyond defining exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class declarations with obfuscated names inheriting from standard exception classes. There is no logic, data processing, input handling, or output. The obfuscation of class names suggests an attempt to hide intent, but as written, there are no active behaviors or potential attack vectors. The code is benign and appears to serve as placeholders or part of a larger, possibly obfuscated, codebase.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains only obfuscated class definitions for custom exceptions without any malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscated naming might be suspicious but does not indicate malicious activity in this fragment.",
