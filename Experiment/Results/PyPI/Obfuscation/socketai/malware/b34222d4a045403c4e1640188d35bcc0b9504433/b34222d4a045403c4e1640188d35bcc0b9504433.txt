      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code demonstrates high suspicion of malicious intent due to its obfuscation, dynamic script generation, and execution of potentially harmful PowerShell commands. The employed techniques align with common malware behaviors, warranting a high malware and security risk score."

      "conclusion": "Based on the provided code and reports, there is no evidence of malicious activity or vulnerabilities. The obfuscation is not inherently malicious, and the empty reports lack sufficient detail to justify concern. The security risk and malware scores should be very low, with the obfuscated score being moderate due to naming obscurity. No immediate action is necessary, but continued monitoring is advised if further evidence emerges."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a network utility with significant obfuscation. While the obfuscation warrants caution, there is no direct evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The high obfuscation is a concern but not definitive of malicious intent. The scores assigned across reports are reasonable and align with the analysis. Continued monitoring and full context review are recommended if used in security-sensitive environments."

      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, albeit obfuscated, proxy management library. There is no concrete evidence of malicious payloads or sabotage, but the obfuscation and proxy flexibility could be exploited in a supply chain attack. Overall, the code is low risk but warrants further contextual review and runtime monitoring."

While the obfuscation warrants caution, there is no evidence of malicious payloads or sabotage. The supply chain risk is low, but deployment should include monitoring and dynamic analysis if used in untrusted environments."

The high obfuscation warrants caution in broader contexts but, in isolation, poses no security threat. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
