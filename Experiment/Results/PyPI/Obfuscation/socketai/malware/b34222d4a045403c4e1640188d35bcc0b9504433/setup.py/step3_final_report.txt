{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package environment, installs dependencies, creates temporary files with decoded base64 content, and executes a VBS script that runs a PowerShell command, employing obfuscation techniques and dynamic execution.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from __init__.py, environment variables (USERPROFILE), base64-encoded strings, and system arguments.",
  "sinks": "Executes the generated VBS script via subprocess Popen, which in turn runs PowerShell commands.",
  "flows": "Decodes base64 strings into scripts -> writes scripts to temp directories -> executes VBS script -> runs PowerShell commands.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding for scripts, dynamic creation and execution of files in temp directories, no validation of decoded content, and reliance on obfuscated code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script employs obfuscation via base64 encoding and dynamic script creation, which are common in malware. It creates files in user temp directories and executes scripts without validation, enabling potential malicious payloads. The decoded VBS runs PowerShell commands, which could be used for malicious activities such as remote code execution or data exfiltration. The dependency installation via subprocess is typical but can be exploited for malicious purposes. Overall, the code exhibits techniques characteristic of malware delivery mechanisms, with high suspicion based on obfuscation, dynamic execution, and covert file handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates high suspicion of malicious intent due to its obfuscation, dynamic script generation, and execution of potentially harmful PowerShell commands. The employed techniques align with common malware behaviors, warranting a high malware and security risk score.",
