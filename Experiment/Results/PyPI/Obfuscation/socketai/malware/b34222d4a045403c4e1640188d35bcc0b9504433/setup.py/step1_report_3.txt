{
  "purpose": "This script appears to set up a Python package, install dependencies, and execute a script from a hidden directory, possibly to run embedded code.",
  "sources": "Reads from the package's __init__.py for version info, reads README.md, environment variable 'USERPROFILE', embedded base64-encoded strings, and script files from a temporary directory.",
  "sinks": "Potentially executes a script file ('main.scripts.cpython-39.vbs') via subprocess.Popen, which could run arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "Reads version info and README -> installs dependencies via subprocess -> decodes embedded base64 strings -> writes files into a temp directory -> changes directory -> executes a script file.",
  "anomalies": "Uses base64 decoding to embed code or data, writes files into a temp directory, creates a VBS script that appears to be a shell command, then executes it. The base64-encoded string decodes to a PowerShell command, indicating hidden code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by importing modules and reading package version info. It enforces minimum Python version. It installs dependencies using subprocess calls to pip. It accesses the environment variable 'USERPROFILE' and constructs a path within the user's temp directory, creating a __pycache__ folder if not exists. It writes two files: a binary-encoded Python file (empty string decoded) and a VBS script with embedded base64-encoded PowerShell command. The script then changes directory into the temp folder and executes the VBS script via subprocess.Popen. The base64 string decodes to a PowerShell command that executes code ('WshShell') and runs a script with 'WScriptShell', indicating potential remote or malicious code execution. The use of base64 decoding, dynamic script writing, and execution of hidden scripts strongly suggests malicious intent or covert operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears designed to secretly decode and execute hidden scripts, likely malicious. It installs dependencies, manipulates temp files, and runs embedded PowerShell code via a VBS script, indicating high malicious intent and security risk.",
