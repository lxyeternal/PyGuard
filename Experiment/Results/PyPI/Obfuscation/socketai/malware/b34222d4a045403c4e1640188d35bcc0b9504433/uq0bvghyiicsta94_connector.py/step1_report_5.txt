{
  "purpose": "Custom HTTP proxy resolver and connector classes for network communication, likely used for managing proxy configurations and making network requests.",
  "sources": "Data is read from function parameters, class attributes, and imported modules. Specifically, proxy configuration parameters, environment variables, and imported helper functions.",
  "sinks": "Network communication functions such as 'super().__init__()', 'gNNlNXtVCoAXorhgwoXpYDPgJTMEKJDZ', and 'await vuzwmEgbxAWRokjBQgsZBgFBiMOmUePT.gNNlNXtVCoAXorhgwoXpYDPgJTMEKJDZ' that send data over the network or modify proxy settings.",
  "flows": "Proxy configuration data flows from class initialization to network request functions. The 'YstfajqWvfFQgaKjNYcVReNyiljaEExl' method updates proxy settings and calls the superclass method for requests. The 'gNNlNXtVCoAXorhgwoXpYDPgJTMEKJDZ' method updates proxy headers if proxy type matches, then proceeds with network requests.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes obfuscated variable and class names, unusual import patterns, and complex proxy handling logic. Use of imported helper functions 'OnKOsciLIPyWtEWDsMvzoQbsUSQuYxup' and 'ttXrxnoTBLyoXxBgoSkMVVJOsNMRkWrG' without context. No hardcoded credentials evident but proxy configuration variables are present, which could be misused. No explicit malicious code such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or damage routines detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom resolver 'zRMBwjIaBayQYofelJhYMYqkvwPaJOoF' that returns DNS resolution info, and a proxy connector 'dMKrfSZHfFFcjKCAohkuKhmOSrmBotrS' that manages proxy configuration and network requests. Proxy credentials are handled through parameters, with some dynamic URL formatting. The functions include conditional logic for proxy type and updating proxy headers, potentially to manipulate network traffic routing. Obfuscated variable names suggest an attempt to obscure intent, but no concrete evidence of malicious activity is found. The imported helper functions and proto module are unknown, but no direct malicious behavior is apparent from their usage. No network exfiltration, command execution, or data leakage routines are visible.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a complex proxy and DNS resolver setup, possibly used for managing network requests through proxies with custom configuration. Although obfuscated, there is no explicit indication of malicious intent or malware. The code’s complexity and obfuscation could be for legitimate reasons or to hinder analysis, but no malicious activity such as data theft, backdoors, or remote command execution is evident. Risk is primarily associated with potential misuse of proxy credentials or traffic manipulation, but no malicious payloads are present.",
