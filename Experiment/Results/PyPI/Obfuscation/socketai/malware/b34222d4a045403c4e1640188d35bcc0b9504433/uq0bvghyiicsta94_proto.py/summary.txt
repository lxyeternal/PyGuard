  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate SOCKS proxy client implementation with significant obfuscation. While the obfuscation warrants caution, there is no evidence of malicious payloads or sabotage. The supply chain risk is low, but deployment should include monitoring and dynamic analysis if used in untrusted environments."
