  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior, actively exfiltrating sensitive system and credential data to external servers while employing obfuscation and stealth techniques. The high frequency of data collection, encoding, and external communication, combined with error suppression and file handling, confirms its malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.9-1, obfuscated ~0.8, security risk ~0.9) are justified and reflect a high-confidence malicious activity."
