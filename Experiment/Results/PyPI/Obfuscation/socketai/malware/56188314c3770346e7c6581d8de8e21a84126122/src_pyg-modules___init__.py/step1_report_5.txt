  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly provided, but it appears to be related to a Python package that may include data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from input parameters, environment variables, or possibly external files (if present). Specific source points are not clearly indicated in the provided code snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communication functions, file write operations, or environment variable manipulations. However, no explicit network or file operations are visible in the code snippet provided.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions, with potential for untrusted data to reach sensitive operations if such exist. In this code, no clear source-to-sink flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code constructs, or unusual behavior are observed. The code appears standard without obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code lacks any obvious malicious payloads such as network connections to suspicious domains, data exfiltration routines, or backdoors. There are no signs of obfuscated code or hidden behaviors. Usage of third-party libraries, if any, does not inherently suggest malicious intent. The structure is straightforward, with no apparent attempts to conceal functionality. Without additional context or external calls, the code seems benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears normal, with no suspicious elements or malicious patterns detected.",
