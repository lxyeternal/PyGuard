  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be a Python package or module, potentially for general utility or application logic.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not clearly evident; the code does not read user input, files, or external data sources explicitly. If environment variables or configuration files are used, they are not shown here.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or system commands if present, but no such actions are explicitly visible in the code snippet provided.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows from untrusted sources to sinks are identifiable within the code. The flow analysis cannot be completed due to the lack of code details.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated sections are detected in the provided snippet. The code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is either minimal or not provided, limiting the depth of analysis. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are evident. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard; no obfuscation or anomalies are present. Without additional context or code, no malicious activities or security issues are identifiable.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain sabotage, or security risks. The code appears benign and does not demonstrate suspicious or malicious patterns.",
