  "purpose": "Assess the security posture of the open source dependency based on provided code snippets and reports, focusing on malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "No code or data input sources are explicitly present; reports indicate absence or minimal code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks are identifiable due to lack of code.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths are observable in the provided information.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code, no suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "All reports consistently note the absence or minimal nature of code, with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. Confidence levels are high where code is absent, and scores for malware and obfuscation are appropriately zero. Security risk scores are slightly above zero in some reports but should be lowered to zero for consistency, given the lack of any suspicious behavior. The reasoning across reports is sound, and the assessments are conservative and justified.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of code and malicious indicators, the dependency poses no security threat. Malware and obfuscation scores should be set to 0, and security risk scores should also be 0 for consistency. Confidence remains high, and no further action is necessary.",
