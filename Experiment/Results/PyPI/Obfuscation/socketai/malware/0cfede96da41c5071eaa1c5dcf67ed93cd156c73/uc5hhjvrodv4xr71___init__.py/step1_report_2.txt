  "flows": "No data flow; the code only performs an import statement with no execution or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of an import statement. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function from a relative module, which is standard in Python packages. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious behavior. The import alone does not indicate any malicious intent, as it is a common practice to organize code in modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It simply imports a function, likely for use elsewhere. No malicious activity, security risks, or obfuscation are evident.",
