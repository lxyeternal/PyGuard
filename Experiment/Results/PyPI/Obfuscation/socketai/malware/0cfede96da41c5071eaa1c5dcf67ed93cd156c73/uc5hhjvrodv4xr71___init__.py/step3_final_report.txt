  "purpose": "Importing the motivate_me function from a local module 'me'.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no data input or external sources involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output data, only imports a function.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the import is static and does not involve runtime data transfer.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import with no obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple relative import of a function from a local module, with no data processing, external communication, or dynamic behavior. The minimal structure and clarity indicate benign intent. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security risks are present. The import is standard practice in Python projects and does not introduce any security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement with no malicious or suspicious activity. All signals confirm its safety, and the minimal nature of the code supports a malware score of 0 and a security risk score of 0. The confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
