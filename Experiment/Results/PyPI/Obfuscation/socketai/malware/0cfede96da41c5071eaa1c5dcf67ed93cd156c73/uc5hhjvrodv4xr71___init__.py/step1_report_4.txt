  "purpose": "Import the 'motivate_me' function or object from a local module named 'me'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module 'me'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or output functions.",
  "flows": "Import statement potentially loads code from 'me' module, but no further data flow in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a simple import statement with no apparent anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward import of 'motivate_me' from a relative module 'me'. This is typical in Python projects to organize code. There are no signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior. Since it is only an import statement, it cannot be evaluated for runtime malicious actions without additional context. The minimal code reduces the likelihood of malicious intent or malicious payloads embedded here.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard import statement with no evident malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet. It appears to be part of a larger, benign codebase.",
