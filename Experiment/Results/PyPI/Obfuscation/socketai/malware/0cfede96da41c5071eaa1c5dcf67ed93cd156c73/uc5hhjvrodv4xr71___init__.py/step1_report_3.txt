  "purpose": "Import the function 'motivate_me' from a local module named 'me'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module '.me'.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data or output operations present.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flow or execution flow beyond import.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; potential concern is the dynamic import from a relative module, but this is standard practice. No suspicious or malicious activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement using relative import syntax. It does not include any input handling, data processing, or output. There are no embedded payloads, obfuscated code, or external data sources. The import appears to be part of a larger package structure. Given the limited scope, there are no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It is standard Python code for importing a function from a local module.",
