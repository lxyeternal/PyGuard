  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward function with no inputs, outputs, or external dependencies. It performs a benign print operation with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and behavior.",
