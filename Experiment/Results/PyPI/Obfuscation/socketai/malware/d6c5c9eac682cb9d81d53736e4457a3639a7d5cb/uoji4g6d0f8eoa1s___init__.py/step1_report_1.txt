{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for a Python package that performs specific data processing or utility functions, with no explicit malicious intent identified.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function parameters, configuration files, environment variables, or standard input; no suspicious external data sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "Data is output via return statements, file writes, or network connections; no obvious leakage points or malicious exfiltration detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (parameters/env) through processing functions to output or network sinks; no suspicious source-to-sink paths identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, unusual code constructs, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors detected. No backdoors or malicious code patterns evident.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard Python constructs with clear data flow. It uses typical libraries and does not exhibit obfuscated or malicious patterns. No suspicious network connections, credential handling, or system modifications are present.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate, functional Python script with no signs of malware or security concerns.",
