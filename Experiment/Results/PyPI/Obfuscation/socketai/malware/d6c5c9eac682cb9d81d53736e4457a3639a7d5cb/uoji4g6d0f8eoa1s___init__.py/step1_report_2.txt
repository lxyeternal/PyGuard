{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a standard Python script performing some data processing or utility functions. No explicit indication of malicious intent is present.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from environment variables and possibly from function parameters or files (if any). The code imports modules such as 'os', 'sys', and 'subprocess', which can read environment variables or execute system commands.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system command execution via 'subprocess' and data handling functions that could leak data if untrusted input is used improperly.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or input parameters into processing functions, and potentially into system calls or output functions. However, without explicit use of untrusted data in dangerous contexts, these flows appear benign.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials or secrets detected. The code does not contain obfuscated or suspicious language features. No hidden backdoors or malicious network activity are apparent. Usage of 'subprocess' warrants scrutiny but is common for legitimate system tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries like 'os', 'sys', and 'subprocess'. It reads environment variables and defines functions for data processing. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communication to suspicious domains, or backdoor creation. The code does not execute untrusted input directly in system calls without validation. No obfuscated code or malicious payloads detected. Overall, the structure and content suggest legitimate utility code.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code appears to be a benign utility script without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It relies on standard libraries and performs expected operations. No indicators of malware or security risks were found.",
