{
  "purpose": "Obfuscated installer that conditionally installs packages, creates shortcuts, or manages files based on platform and input args.",
  "sources": "Reads sys.platform, sys.argv[1], environment variables, filesystem; imports pip, os, win32com, ctypes.",
  "sinks": "Executes pip.main() for package install, creates shortcuts (CreateShortcut()), manipulates files, directories, environment variables, checks admin rights.",
  "flows": "Input args and environment influence package installation, file operations, shortcut creation; complex calculations determine behavior.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with complex bitwise operations, non-descriptive variable names, nested expressions, dynamic string generation.",
  "analysis": "The code’s obfuscation and behavior—installing packages, creating shortcuts, system modifications—are characteristic of malicious activity. The use of pip, system API calls, and file manipulations, combined with obfuscation, strongly suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Likely malicious, sabotage, or supply chain attack. High confidence (0.9), obfuscated (1), malware (0.9), risk (0.9).",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 1,
