    "deletion of files in system directories, indicating potential cleanup or obfuscation"
  ],
  "analysis": "The script begins by setting up a package configuration and ensures required modules ('requests' and 'subprocess') are installed. It then creates a hidden directory in the Windows system directory. The code downloads two executables from Discord CDN links and saves them into the hidden directory, renaming them to system-like filenames. These files are then executed immediately, and finally, the script attempts to delete the downloaded files and remove the directory. The use of obscure variable names, remote executable downloads, and immediate execution strongly suggests malicious intent, potentially for installing malware or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits highly suspicious behavior characteristic of malware. It downloads and executes remote binaries without validation, uses hidden directories, and deletes files afterward, all of which indicate an attempt to conceal malicious activity. The overall security risk is high.",
