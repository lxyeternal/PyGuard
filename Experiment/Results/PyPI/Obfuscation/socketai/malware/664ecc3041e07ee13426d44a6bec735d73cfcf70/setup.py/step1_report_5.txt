{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package and then downloads and executes potentially malicious executables from external URLs, possibly for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "Input sources include external URLs (requests.get calls) and system calls to remove or create files; also, import statements for 'requests' and 'subprocess'.",
  "sinks": "File writes ('open' and 'write'), renaming files, executing files via 'os.startfile', and removal of directories/files.",
  "flows": "External URLs are fetched, saved as executables, renamed to system-like paths, and then executed; deletion of previous files occurs before download; potentially malicious files are run immediately after download.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names, direct download and execution of executable files from external sources, writing files to system directories with disguised names, and silent removal of files and directories. The code suppresses exceptions silently, masking failures.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup operations but then proceeds to download two executables from Discord CDN URLs, saves them with disguised filenames in a system-like directory, and executes them. It deletes previous versions of these files before re-downloading. The execution of these files without user consent and the use of system directories suggest malicious intent. The code's variable names are obfuscated, and exception handling suppresses errors, which is typical in malicious scripts to avoid detection. No legitimate purpose for such behavior is evident, and the code exhibits typical malware characteristics like remote payload fetching and stealthy execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious, involving downloading and executing external binaries from untrusted sources, with obfuscated variable names and silent error handling. It shows typical malicious behavior patterns, indicating likely malware or backdoor functionality.",
