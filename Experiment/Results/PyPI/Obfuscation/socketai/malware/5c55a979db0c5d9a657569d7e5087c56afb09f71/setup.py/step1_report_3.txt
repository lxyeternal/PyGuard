    "The filename 'je0mjqs3zztdackm' is obfuscated or randomly generated"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code begins with a standard setup call but then immediately checks for the existence of a directory 'tahg'. If missing, it executes a hidden PowerShell command encoded in Base64. The command is obfuscated, which is a common tactic to hide malicious intent. The use of subprocess.Popen with CREATE_NO_WINDOW suggests an attempt to execute stealthily. The code also wraps these operations in try-except blocks, ignoring errors silently, which could hide failures or malicious activity. The overall structure, especially the encoded PowerShell execution, strongly indicates malicious behavior aimed at remote code execution or system compromise.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains suspicious activity primarily due to the execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command in a hidden window. This behavior is characteristic of malicious payloads attempting to run remote or embedded malicious code stealthily. The setup portion is benign but overshadowed by the potentially malicious command execution. Overall, this code exhibits a high likelihood of malicious intent.",
