  "purpose": "Import multiple obfuscated functions from a submodule, likely for later execution or analysis.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'utilitytools.run' module, specifically importing functions with seemingly random or obfuscated names.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network communication, file writing, or system commands are visible within this snippet.",
  "flows": "Import statements themselves do not create data flows; potential flows depend on how imported functions are used later, which is not provided.",
  "anomalies": "The imported function names appear highly obfuscated and nonsensical, which can be suspicious. No documentation or comments are present, and the functions are imported but not used in this fragment.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements bringing in functions with seemingly random or obfuscated names from 'utilitytools.run'. This pattern is often used to hide malicious functions or payloads, especially when combined with obfuscated names. No other code is present that indicates data processing, network activity, or execution of dynamic code. However, the obfuscation itself raises suspicion of malicious intent or at least an attempt to conceal the code's purpose. Without further context or usage, the code's intent cannot be definitively classified as malicious, but the obfuscation and lack of clarity are red flags.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment appears suspicious due to the obfuscated function names and lack of context, suggesting possible malicious intent or concealment. However, without additional code showing how these functions are used, the risk cannot be definitively determined. The snippet warrants further review of the complete module.",
