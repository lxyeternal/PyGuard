  "purpose": "Importing functions with obfuscated or nonsensical names from the 'utilitytools.run' module, likely to conceal functionality.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'utilitytools.run' with obfuscated identifiers.",
  "sinks": "No data flows, function calls, or network activity observed; potential sinks are not present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "None, as only import statements are present; no execution or data transfer occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated, nonsensical import names, which is suspicious and suggests possible concealment.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with obfuscated names, which raises suspicion but does not demonstrate malicious activity. The high obfuscation scores are justified due to the nonsensical identifiers. No evidence of code execution, data leaks, or network activity is present. The malware scores are low (around 0.2-0.3), reflecting suspicion but no confirmed malicious intent. The security risk scores are moderate (~0.2-0.4), considering the obfuscation alone. Further analysis of how these imported objects are used later in the code is necessary to determine actual risk.",
  "conclusion": "The import statements with obfuscated names are suspicious but passive; no malicious activity is demonstrated in this snippet. The scores assigned are appropriate given the context. Caution is advised, and further review of the usage of these imported objects is recommended to assess potential malicious behavior.",
