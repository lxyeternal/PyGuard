{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up a Python package, but it contains malicious activity including downloading and executing an external executable during installation or development commands.",
  "sources": "The code reads input/data from a hardcoded URL ('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IncsecRishie/wdwddwdw/main/pics.exe') during the function qLvwJnGaVVCrzGfRLJFShuDtRmTVEwYJ, which is invoked in setup commands.",
  "sinks": "The executable downloaded from the URL is written to disk and then executed via subprocess.Popen, leading to potential remote code execution.",
  "flows": "The flow involves the function qLvwJnGaVVCrzGfRLJFShuDtRmTVEwYJ() downloading the executable from the URL, saving it as 'pics.exe', and then executing it, triggered during setup/develop commands.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains obfuscated function names, an unused base64 decoding function, and performs remote download and execution during package setup, which are unusual behaviors for a typical setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script includes functions that download and execute an external executable from a remote URL during package installation or development setup, which is a classic malicious pattern. The obfuscated function names and unused base64 decoder suggest attempts to hide malicious intent. The download occurs without validation, and the executable is run immediately, indicating high malicious potential. The code's behavior aligns with supply chain attack tactics, aiming to execute arbitrary code on the target system during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high-confidence malicious activity, specifically remote code download and execution during setup, with obfuscation to hide intent. The package is unsafe and should be flagged for removal or further investigation.",
