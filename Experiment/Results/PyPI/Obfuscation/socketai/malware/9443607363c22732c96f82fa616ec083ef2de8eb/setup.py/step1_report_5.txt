{
  "purpose": "The script is intended to set up a Python package with some utility functions and optional installation steps, primarily using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Requests library for downloading files; hardcoded URL for fetching an executable; code executing subprocess to run downloaded file.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.Popen to execute the downloaded executable; file write operation for the downloaded content.",
  "flows": "The code downloads an executable from a remote URL, saves it locally, and then attempts to run it using subprocess.Popen.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual obfuscation of function names; downloading and executing a remote executable during setup process; no explicit checks or validations for the downloaded file; the code could be used maliciously to fetch and run arbitrary code during package installation.",
  "analysis": "The script contains functions that decode base64-encoded strings and download a remote executable from GitHub. It then attempts to execute this downloaded file using subprocess.Popen. The setup configuration includes custom commands that invoke these functions during the install and develop phases. The code employs obfuscated function names and hardcoded URLs, which are suspicious. The process of downloading and executing an external executable during package installation is highly unusual and potentially malicious. There are no safety checks, validation, or sandboxing, raising significant security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code demonstrates potentially malicious behavior, specifically downloading and executing a remote executable during package setup. Such behavior can be used for supply chain attacks or malware distribution. The obfuscation and the direct execution of downloaded code are strong indicators of malicious intent. Caution is advised, and this package should be considered unsafe for use.",
