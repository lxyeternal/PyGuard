{
  "purpose": "The script appears to facilitate Python package setup and installation, with some auxiliary functions for decoding base64 strings and downloading/executing a file from a remote URL. It aims to provide a utility package with additional post-installation actions.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from environment (e.g., package setup parameters), local files (via open in 'KuflOSmKGxxjTscTflVAAiffcfHOHVXB'), and external URL (via requests.get). The URL to 'pics.exe' is hardcoded, and the code fetches and writes this file.",
  "sinks": "The code potentially executes a downloaded file ('pics.exe') using subprocess.Popen, which can be malicious if the file is harmful. It also decodes base64 strings, but the decoded content isn't directly used maliciously here. The code does not send or leak data but executes downloaded content.",
  "flows": "Input from setup configuration and external URL (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IncsecRishie/wdwddwdw/main/pics.exe) flows into download function, which writes to disk, then to subprocess execution of the downloaded file.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a function downloading and executing an external executable ('pics.exe') from a remote URL is suspicious. The URL is hardcoded and points to an external source, which could be malicious. The function is invoked during the install process, indicating automatic download and execution during package install. The variable names are obfuscated or nonsensical, which can be a sign of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code includes standard setup functions with obfuscated variable names and no immediate malicious actions. However, it contains a function that downloads an executable from an external URL and runs it automatically during installation, which is a significant security concern. The use of subprocess to execute a remote payload is typical in malicious supply chain attacks. The base64 decoding function is present but unused in the malicious context. The download function checks for successful retrieval before executing, but the hardcoded URL and automatic execution during install make this highly suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign setup script with an embedded malicious activity: downloading and executing an external executable during installation. This behavior indicates an attempt to introduce malware via the package, likely for malicious purposes such as remote control or payload delivery. The presence of obfuscated variable names and remote execution during install raises high suspicion.",
