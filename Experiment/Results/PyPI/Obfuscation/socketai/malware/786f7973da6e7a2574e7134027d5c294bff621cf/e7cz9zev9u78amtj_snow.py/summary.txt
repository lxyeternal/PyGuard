  "conclusion": "The dependency contains code with varying levels of suspicion. High-risk reports demonstrate clear malicious indicators justifying elevated malware and obfuscation scores. Moderate-risk reports show potential but lack definitive payloads. Overall, the security posture warrants caution, especially regarding code employing obfuscation and dynamic execution, which could be exploited maliciously. Slight score adjustments improve alignment with observed signals."
