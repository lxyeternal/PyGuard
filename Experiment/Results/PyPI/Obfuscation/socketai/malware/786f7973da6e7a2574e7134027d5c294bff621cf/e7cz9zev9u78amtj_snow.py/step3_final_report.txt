  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code signals such as dynamic execution, obfuscation, network activity, and credential handling.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, user inputs, command-line arguments, and embedded data; sinks include network connections, file writes, subprocess calls, and environment modifications.",
  "sinks": "Potential data exfiltration points, network communication, file system modifications, subprocess executions, and environment variable manipulations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources like inputs and environment variables through processing functions, potentially reaching sinks such as network sockets or file outputs, especially when eval/exec or obfuscated code is involved.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval/exec on untrusted data, obfuscated variable names, hardcoded IPs/domains, base64 encoding, dynamic code generation, and suspicious network activity without clear benign purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits typical signs of malicious intent in high-risk reports, such as obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and network communication. Low to moderate risk reports show cautious use of eval and potential obfuscation but lack definitive malicious payloads. The overall suspicion is higher in reports with explicit obfuscation and network activity. Scores are adjusted to reflect the strength of indicators, with malware scores increased where evidence suggests potential malicious behavior. The confidence level is high for reports with strong indicators, moderate for those with ambiguous signals.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency contains code with varying levels of suspicion. High-risk reports demonstrate clear malicious indicators justifying elevated malware and obfuscation scores. Moderate-risk reports show potential but lack definitive payloads. Overall, the security posture warrants caution, especially regarding code employing obfuscation and dynamic execution, which could be exploited maliciously. Slight score adjustments improve alignment with observed signals.",
