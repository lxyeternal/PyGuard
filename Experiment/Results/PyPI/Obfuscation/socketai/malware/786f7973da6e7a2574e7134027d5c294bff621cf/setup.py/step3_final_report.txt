{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a credential, token, cookie, and data stealer targeting browsers, Discord, wallets, and system info, exfiltrating data via webhooks and anonymous hosts.",
  "sources": "Browser data directories, local storage files, Discord local files, wallet directories, system files, and user input logs.",
  "sinks": "Webhook URLs, anonymous file hosts, file uploads, and network requests to exfiltrate collected data.",
  "flows": "Sources (local files, directories, API responses) → Decryption routines and data parsing → Data stored in variables → Exfiltration functions (uploadToken, upload, ZipThings) → Webhook or file host.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded webhook URL, silent dependency installation, extensive system and file access, process termination commands, minimal obfuscation, and data collection routines without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code actively collects sensitive data such as Discord tokens, passwords, cookies, wallet info, and system IP. It decrypts stored credentials using Windows APIs, validates tokens, and exfiltrates data via a hardcoded webhook and anonymous hosting. It employs threading for concurrent collection, silently installs dependencies, and manipulates processes to conceal activity. All behaviors are consistent with malicious credential and data theft malware. The code's structure and routines are straightforward, with minimal obfuscation, and the data flows from sources to sinks without legitimate purpose. The presence of hardcoded webhooks, decryption routines, and system access confirms malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a highly malicious credential and data stealer, actively exfiltrating sensitive user information through multiple channels. It employs system API calls for decryption, extensive file and directory access, and network communication with external servers. The behavior is consistent with malware designed for espionage, credential theft, and system compromise. The assigned malware score of 1, obfuscation score of approximately 0.2, and security risk score of 1 are justified and align with the observed activities.",
