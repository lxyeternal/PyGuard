{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a stealer designed to extract and exfiltrate sensitive user data such as Discord tokens, passwords, cookies, and browser credentials, and then upload this data to remote servers or file sharing services.",
  "sources": "Reading files from browser directories (passwords, cookies, local storage), reading local database files (Chrome, Edge, Brave, Yandex, Opera, Steam, Exodus, wallets), API requests to Discord for token validation, IP retrieval via URL, and environment variables for paths.",
  "sinks": "Requests to upload data to external webhooks and transfer.sh, writing to temporary files, executing subprocesses to kill processes and zip files, network requests to exfiltrate data, and potentially executing pip installs and other subprocess calls.",
  "flows": "Data is collected from browser/local storage/database files, decrypted, and then sent via HTTP POST requests or file uploads to remote servers. Data flows from file reads and API responses into in-memory variables, then to external endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation is minimal but the code contains numerous suspicious behaviors: including dynamic library loading, decryption routines for Chrome data, network requests to Discord API and webhooks, and direct execution of commands to kill processes and zip files. It also dynamically installs packages without user consent, which is suspicious. The code includes hardcoded webhook URLs, potentially malicious data exfiltration points, and extensive credential theft logic.",
  "analysis": "The script collects sensitive data such as browser passwords, cookies, Discord tokens, and wallet information by accessing local files, databases, and browser storage. It decrypts encrypted data using system APIs and cryptography modules. It also queries Discord API endpoints for user info, guilds, billing, and friend lists, potentially for further exploitation. The collected data is then uploaded to a Discord webhook or anonymous file-sharing services. The code includes functions to process, zip, and exfiltrate the data. It also attempts to install missing dependencies silently, indicating persistence or obfuscation efforts. Multiple threads are used for parallel data collection. Overall, the code exhibits typical stealer characteristics with extensive data exfiltration, active process termination, and file uploads, strongly indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, acting as a credential and data stealer targeting browser data, Discord tokens, and wallet information. It exfiltrates data via webhooks and file sharing services, and performs suspicious system modifications such as process termination and file zipping. The code demonstrates clear malicious intent with no legitimate user-facing functionality.",
