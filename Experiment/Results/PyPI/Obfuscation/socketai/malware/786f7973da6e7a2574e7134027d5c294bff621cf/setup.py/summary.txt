  "conclusion": "The code is a highly malicious credential and data stealer, actively exfiltrating sensitive user information through multiple channels. It employs system API calls for decryption, extensive file and directory access, and network communication with external servers. The behavior is consistent with malware designed for espionage, credential theft, and system compromise. The assigned malware score of 1, obfuscation score of approximately 0.2, and security risk score of 1 are justified and align with the observed activities."
