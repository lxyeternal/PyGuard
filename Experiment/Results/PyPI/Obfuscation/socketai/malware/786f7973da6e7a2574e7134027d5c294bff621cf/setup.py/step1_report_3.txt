{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for stealing sensitive information such as Discord tokens, passwords, cookies, and browser data, then exfiltrating this data via webhook and anonymous file transfer services. It also includes functions for collecting browser and application data and packaging them into archives for exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables (e.g., LOCALAPPDATA, APPDATA, TEMP), browser data files (Chrome, Opera, Brave, Yandex, Edge, Discord, Lightcord, Canary, PTB), Discord local state files, and log files within user directories, as well as network requests to APIs for token validation, user info, billing, and friend data.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows into requests to external URLs (webhook, transfer.sh, anonfiles), file uploads, and data exfiltration functions, including sending tokens, passwords, cookies, and browser data. Data is sent via HTTP POST requests and file uploads without encryption or validation, indicating potential exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Sensitive data such as Discord tokens, passwords, cookies, IP address, and user info are collected from various local files and APIs, then transmitted via webhook payloads and file uploads. The functions gather tokens/passwords/cookies, validate tokens, then assemble and send data to remote servers. Archive files are also created and uploaded.",
  "anomalies": "Obvious malicious behavior includes extensive data theft functions, such as stealing browser passwords and cookies, Discord tokens, user info, and exfiltrating via webhook and anonymous file hosting. The code attempts to silently install dependencies, collects browser and Discord data, and uploads it without user consent. Additionally, the code disables processes (taskkill) for certain applications. The use of hardcoded webhook URL and malicious data collection patterns are suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is structured to perform multiple malicious activities: 1) It installs dependencies like requests and pycryptodome silently. 2) It collects sensitive data from browsers, Discord, and system files. 3) It decrypts stored credentials and tokens, validates tokens, and then compiles user info, passwords, cookies, and tokens. 4) It exfiltrates data via a Discord webhook and uploads files to anonymous hosting services. 5) It includes functions for collecting wallet data and other sensitive files, zipping them, and uploading. 6) The presence of hardcoded webhook URLs, silent dependency installation, and data exfiltration functions strongly suggest malicious intent. 7) The code is designed to run in the background, hidden, and silently gather user data without consent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious intent, aimed at data theft and exfiltration, including Discord tokens, passwords, cookies, and system information. It uses multiple techniques to gather, decrypt, and upload sensitive data, indicating it is malware rather than legitimate software. The behavior is consistent with spyware or information-stealing malware.",
