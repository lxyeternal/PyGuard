      "confidence": 1,
      "conclusion": "The code is a highly malicious credential and data stealer, actively exfiltrating sensitive user information through multiple channels. It employs system API calls for decryption, extensive file and directory access, and network communication with external servers. The behavior is consistent with malware designed for espionage, credential theft, and system compromise. The assigned malware score of 1, obfuscation score of approximately 0.2, and security risk score of 1 are justified and align with the observed activities."

      "conclusion": "No confirmed malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The main security concern is the use of eval(), which elevates the risk slightly but does not constitute malware. The overall security posture is low risk, with scores adjusted to reflect cautious evaluation of dynamic code execution."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The dependency contains code with varying levels of suspicion. High-risk reports demonstrate clear malicious indicators justifying elevated malware and obfuscation scores. Moderate-risk reports show potential but lack definitive payloads. Overall, the security posture warrants caution, especially regarding code employing obfuscation and dynamic execution, which could be exploited maliciously. Slight score adjustments improve alignment with observed signals."
