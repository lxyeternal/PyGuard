{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that, upon installation, attempts to establish a reverse shell connection to a remote server.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the network socket connected to a remote IP and port during the install process.",
  "sinks": "The socket connection and the pty.spawn call create a reverse shell, providing remote control access to the system.",
  "flows": "During installation, the code creates a socket connection to the remote server, duplicates socket file descriptors to standard input/output/error, then spawns a shell, enabling remote command execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class and method names, hardcoded IP address and port, and the reverse shell behavior all indicate malicious intent; no legitimate package setup requires such activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that, when invoked, establishes a TCP connection to a specified remote server. It then redirects the system's standard input, output, and error streams to this socket, and spawns a shell process, effectively creating a reverse shell. The IP address and port are hardcoded, which is suspicious. The obfuscated class and method names serve to hide malicious behavior. The code does not include any legitimate package functionality beyond the setup configuration, and the reverse shell code is embedded directly in the install routine, indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains embedded malicious code that, upon installation, creates a reverse shell back to a remote server. The use of obfuscation, hardcoded network details, and reverse shell behavior indicate high malicious potential. The package should be considered dangerous and not used.",
