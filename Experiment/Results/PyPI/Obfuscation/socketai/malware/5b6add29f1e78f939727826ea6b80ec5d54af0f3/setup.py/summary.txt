  "conclusion": "The code contains explicit malicious behavior, establishing a reverse shell during package installation. The obfuscation and hardcoded C2 address further confirm malicious intent. The activity warrants a malware score of 1, a security risk score of 1, and an obfuscation score around 0.9. The package should be flagged and avoided due to its severe security implications."
