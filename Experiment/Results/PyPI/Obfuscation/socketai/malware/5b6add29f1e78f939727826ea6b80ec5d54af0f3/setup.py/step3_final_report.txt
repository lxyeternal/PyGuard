{
  "purpose": "The code establishes a reverse shell connection to a hardcoded IP and port during package installation, enabling remote control of the host system.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the socket connection established to the hardcoded IP and port.",
  "sinks": "The socket connection and os.dup2 calls redirect input/output streams to the socket, which then leads to spawning a shell, allowing remote command execution.",
  "flows": "The code creates a socket connection to the remote server, duplicates the socket's file descriptor to stdin, stdout, and stderr, then spawns a shell, facilitating remote command execution.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names, hardcoded IP and port, and the immediate spawning of a shell during setup are unusual and indicative of malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code explicitly connects to a remote server via socket, redirects standard input/output/error to this connection, and spawns a shell, creating a reverse shell backdoor. The obfuscated identifiers aim to conceal malicious activity. The behavior is consistent with malicious remote access tools, and the hardcoded IP/port suggests command-and-control infrastructure. The activity occurs during package installation, which is highly suspicious and dangerous. The code's actions pose a severe security risk, enabling remote code execution and potential system compromise.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains explicit malicious behavior, establishing a reverse shell during package installation. The obfuscation and hardcoded C2 address further confirm malicious intent. The activity warrants a malware score of 1, a security risk score of 1, and an obfuscation score around 0.9. The package should be flagged and avoided due to its severe security implications.",
