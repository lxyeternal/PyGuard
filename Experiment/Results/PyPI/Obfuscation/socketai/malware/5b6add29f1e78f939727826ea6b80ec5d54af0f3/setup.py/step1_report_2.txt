{
  "purpose": "Setup script that installs a Python package and overrides the install command to establish a reverse shell connection.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded IP address and port, and socket creation and connection occur during installation.",
  "sinks": "Socket connection and file descriptor duplication potentially allow remote command execution and control.",
  "flows": "During installation, IP and port are used to establish a network connection, then file descriptors are duplicated to stdin, stdout, stderr, and a shell is spawned.",
  "anomalies": "The install command is overridden to initiate a reverse shell, which is unusual and malicious behavior. The IP address and port are hardcoded, indicating potential command-and-control server.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command for setuptools. During installation, it creates a socket connection to a remote IP and port, then redirects standard input, output, and error to this socket, and spawns a shell. This behavior allows remote code execution upon package installation. The code is intentionally designed to establish a backdoor. No other third-party library or obfuscation is present. The structure is straightforward but malicious in intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior—setting up a reverse shell during package installation. The hardcoded IP and port suggest command-and-control. This package is malicious and should not be used.",
