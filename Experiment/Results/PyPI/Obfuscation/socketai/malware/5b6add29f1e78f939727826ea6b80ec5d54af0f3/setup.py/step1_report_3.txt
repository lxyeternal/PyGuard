{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up a Python package installation configuration.",
  "sources": "The code reads external data from a hardcoded IP address and port within the method 'aLwnNntXmYhNtmZFJvqZDfEIBAwVuBvX'.",
  "sinks": "The socket connection and 'pty.spawn('/bin/sh')' are potential sinks where data could be transmitted or a shell could be spawned.",
  "flows": "The code initiates a socket connection to a remote IP and port, duplicates the socket's file descriptor to standard input/output/error, then spawns a shell.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated class and method names, hardcoded IP address and port, socket connection and spawning a shell which can be used for remote control, indicating malicious intent. The code does not serve typical package setup purposes.",
  "analysis": "The class 'kOXLYNLykbGHmvJPjSaFIuYxelBIwQLI' overrides the 'install' command from setuptools. Within its method, it connects to a remote server at 85.159.212.47:61985, then redirects standard input/output/error streams to this socket, and spawns a shell. This behavior is characteristic of backdoors or remote access tools, not typical setup code. The obfuscated naming further suggests malicious intent. The rest of the setup code appears normal but is likely used to hide malicious activity behind ostensibly benign packaging.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains clear malicious behavior intended for remote access, including hardcoded IP, socket connection, and spawning a shell. This is highly suspicious and indicative of a backdoor within a package, which poses serious security risks.",
