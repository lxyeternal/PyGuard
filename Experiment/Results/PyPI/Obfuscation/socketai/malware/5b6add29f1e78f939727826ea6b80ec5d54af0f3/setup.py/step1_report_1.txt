{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom setup script for a Python package that, during installation, initiates a reverse shell connection to a remote server.",
  "sources": "The IP address '85.159.212.47' and port 61985 are hardcoded in the code; socket connection is established during the install process.",
  "sinks": "The socket connection acts as a sink, potentially allowing remote command execution; spawning a shell via pty.spawn('/bin/sh') further enables remote code execution.",
  "flows": "The install process (source) triggers a socket connection to the hardcoded IP and port, then duplicates the socket's file descriptor to standard input, output, and error, and spawns a shell, creating a reverse shell path.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names; hardcoded IP and port; no user input or external configuration; initiating a reverse shell during package installation is highly suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports socket, os, pty, and setuptools modules. It defines a class inheriting from 'install' with a method that creates a socket connection to a specified IP and port. Once connected, it duplicates the socket's file descriptor to standard streams and spawns a shell, effectively creating a reverse shell. This behavior indicates malicious intent as it allows remote control of the host system during package installation. The obfuscated class and method names suggest an attempt to conceal malicious functionality. No other benign functionality is apparent; the code is explicitly designed to establish unauthorized remote access.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains embedded malicious code that creates a reverse shell to a remote server during installation. The behavior is highly suspicious and indicates malicious intent, such as remote code execution or backdoor access. The package should be considered dangerous and not used.",
