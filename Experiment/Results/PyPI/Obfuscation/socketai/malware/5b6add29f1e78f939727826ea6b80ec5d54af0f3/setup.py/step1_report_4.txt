{
  "purpose": "This code defines a setup script for a Python package that, during installation, attempts to establish a reverse shell connection to a remote server.",
  "sources": "The code reads the hardcoded IP address and port within the class method to establish a socket connection.",
  "sinks": "The socket connection is used to redirect standard input/output/error, spawning a shell ('/bin/sh'), enabling remote command execution.",
  "flows": "The code reads the IP and port (sources), then creates a socket connection (sink), redirects stdin/stdout/stderr to this socket, and spawns a shell (sink), allowing remote control.",
  "anomalies": "The class name and method are obfuscated, and the code performs network communication and spawning a shell during the installation process, which is unusual for a typical setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code imports socket, os, pty, and setuptools modules, and overrides the install command in setuptools. Within the custom install class, it creates a socket connection to a specific IP address and port, then redirects the process's standard input, output, and error streams to this socket. It subsequently spawns a shell via pty.spawn, effectively creating a reverse shell back to the attacker-controlled server. The IP address and port are hardcoded, indicating malicious intent to provide remote access. The obfuscated class and method names are common tactics to hide malicious functionality. The code executes during the package installation, which could be triggered by unsuspecting users, leading to potential system compromise.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains malicious code that establishes a reverse shell to a remote server during installation, representing a serious security risk. The behavior indicates intent to gain unauthorized remote access. The code appears deliberately obfuscated, and the activity is highly suspicious, confirming malicious intent.",
