  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code input, data handling, network connections, dynamic execution points, hardcoded secrets.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission, file operations, environment variable access, dynamic code execution, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources leading to sinks via data processing, obfuscated code paths, dynamic execution, network communication.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation (high), dynamic code execution, network activity, ambiguous data flows, potential data exfiltration, inconsistent suspicion levels.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits high obfuscation (score 0.8-0.7), dynamic execution, and network activity, indicating potential malicious intent. Suspicion is moderate to high but no definitive malicious payloads are confirmed. The malware score is adjusted to 0.4 for reports with suspicious patterns, aligning with the suspicion level. Obfuscation scores are justified by the described techniques. Security risk scores reflect moderate concern, justified by obfuscation and network activity, but no confirmed malicious actions. Confidence levels are moderate to high, based on the described patterns and absence of concrete payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows signs of obfuscation and suspicious behavior but lacks definitive malicious payloads. The adjusted malware score of 0.4 and high obfuscation scores are justified. Overall security risk is moderate (~0.45). The assessments are consistent with the evidence, with slight upward adjustments for suspicion levels in some reports.",
