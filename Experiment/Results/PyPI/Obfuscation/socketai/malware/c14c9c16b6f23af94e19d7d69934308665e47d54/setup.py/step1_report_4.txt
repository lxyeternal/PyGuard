  "purpose": "The code defines a custom installation command for a Python package that executes an external module during installation.",
  "sources": "The subprocess call executing 'poc_nvk.my_module' using the current Python interpreter.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess execution could potentially run arbitrary code from 'poc_nvk.my_module'.",
  "flows": "During installation, the code calls subprocess with the current Python interpreter and a module 'poc_nvk.my_module', executing it immediately.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names, minimal descriptive information, and execution of an external module during install process.",
  "analysis": "The script redefines the install command to invoke a subprocess that runs 'poc_nvk.my_module' using the current Python interpreter. The class and method names are deliberately obfuscated, which is suspicious. The subprocess call is a potential malicious behavior, as it may execute arbitrary code contained within 'poc_nvk.my_module'. There are no explicit credentials, hardcoded secrets, or obvious malicious intents visible, but the obfuscation and execution pattern raise security concerns. The package name and version are generic, and the metadata does not reveal further intent. The code's primary concern is the execution of external code during install, which could be used maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits obfuscation and executes an external module during installation, which could be malicious. While no explicit malicious actions are shown, the pattern is suspicious and warrants caution. It could be used to run arbitrary code at install time, representing a security risk.",
