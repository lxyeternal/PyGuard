  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that customizes the installation process by running an additional module after installation.",
  "sources": "sys.executable and subprocess.VdlPtvNmMzGyJYoRouOSpPwLPYNaIxUI()",
  "sinks": "subprocess.VdlPtvNmMzGyJYoRouOSpPwLPYNaIxUI()",
  "flows": "sys.executable -> subprocess.VdlPtvNmMzGyJYoRouOSpPwLPYNaIxUI() -> execution of 'poc_nvk.my_module'",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated method names and variable names; invocation of subprocess with a dynamically constructed command that could run arbitrary code",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools modules for packaging and overrides the 'install' command to run an additional subprocess during installation. The method names and variables are obfuscated, which raises suspicion. The subprocess call executes the module 'poc_nvk.my_module' using the current Python interpreter, which could potentially run malicious code or perform unwanted actions. The obfuscation and dynamic execution raise concerns about hidden or malicious intent, especially since the module executed is not part of the standard setup process.",
  "conclusion": "The script exhibits suspicious obfuscation and runs an additional module during installation, which could be malicious. The use of obfuscated names and the subprocess call to an unspecified module suggest potential malicious behavior or backdoor capabilities. This code warrants further investigation before use.",
