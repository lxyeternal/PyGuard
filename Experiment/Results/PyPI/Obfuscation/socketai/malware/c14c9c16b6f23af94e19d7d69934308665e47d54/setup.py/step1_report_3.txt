{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a setup script for a Python package, with a custom installation class that executes a subprocess during installation.",
  "sources": "sys.executable, subprocess.VdlPtvNmMzGyJYoRouOSpPwLPYNaIxUI (potentially calling subprocess with a function name that looks obfuscated or malformed)",
  "sinks": "subprocess.VdlPtvNmMzGyJYoRouOSpPwLPYNaIxUI([sys.executable, '-m', 'poc_nvk.my_module']) (executes a module potentially during installation)",
  "flows": "During the install process, the code runs a subprocess that invokes a Python module (poc_nvk.my_module), which could execute arbitrary code",
  "anomalies": "Class and method names are nonsensical and appear obfuscated; the method call 'subprocess.VdlPtvNmMzGyJYoRouOSpPwLPYNaIxUI' likely intends to execute a command but uses an unusual attribute, indicating potential obfuscation or tampering; variable 'QjZQpiKeeIcTPFYCXZOrZnKuJgocYWrg' is assigned a string resembling a media type, which is unused elsewhere",
  "analysis": "The setup script imports 'setuptools' and defines a custom class inheriting from 'install'. The class overrides a method with an obfuscated name and calls a similarly obfuscated method 'VdlPtvNmMzGyJYoRouOSpPwLPYNaIxUI' on 'install', passing a subprocess command that executes a module 'poc_nvk.my_module'. The use of obfuscated method and class names suggests intentional concealment. The subprocess execution during installation could run arbitrary code from the specified module, posing a security risk. The presence of nonsensical variable names and the invocation of a potentially malicious module indicates malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated method names and executes an external module during installation, which could be malicious. The execution of 'poc_nvk.my_module' during setup is suspicious and indicates potential malicious behavior or sabotage of the package.",
