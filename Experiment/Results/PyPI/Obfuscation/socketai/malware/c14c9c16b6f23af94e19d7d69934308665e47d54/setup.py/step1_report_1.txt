{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom installation command for a Python package, which executes a specific module during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package setup parameters and runs a subprocess call within a custom install class.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess call executes a module ('poc_nvk.my_module') using the current Python interpreter, which could execute arbitrary code if the module is malicious.",
  "flows": "During package installation, the custom install command triggers subprocess execution of 'poc_nvk.my_module', which could potentially run malicious code if the module contains harmful payloads.",
  "anomalies": "The class and method names are intentionally obfuscated (e.g., 'BsUlXdScNZhRfzxypcUmjWtvpmHVivhX', 'VdlPtvNmMzGyJYoRouOSpPwLPYNaIxUI'), and the subprocess call uses a non-standard method 'VdlPtvNmMzGyJYoRouOSpPwLPYNaIxUI', which is unusual and suspicious. The module name 'poc_nvk.my_module' suggests potential malicious intent ('poc' commonly used as an acronym for 'proof of concept'), and the code dynamically executes code during setup.",
  "analysis": "The script redefines the setup process by creating a custom class that inherits from 'install' and overrides a method with an obfuscated name. Inside this method, it calls a subprocess that runs a module ('poc_nvk.my_module') using the current Python interpreter, which could execute malicious payloads if that module is harmful. The obfuscation and dynamic execution during installation are suspicious behaviors, often associated with malicious or backdoored packages. The package name and the presence of obfuscated identifiers suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits highly suspicious obfuscation and dynamically executes an external module during installation, which is a common tactic in malicious packages to run harmful code unnoticed. The combination of obfuscation, the module name ('poc'), and execution during setup strongly indicates malicious behavior. This package should be treated as potentially malicious and avoided.",
