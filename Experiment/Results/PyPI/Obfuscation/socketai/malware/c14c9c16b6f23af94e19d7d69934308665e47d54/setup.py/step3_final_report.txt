{
  "purpose": "The code attempts to execute an external module during installation, likely to run malicious or hidden code, while obfuscating its intent.",
  "sources": "The subprocess call executing 'poc_nvk.my_module' via sys.executable",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'poc_nvk.my_module' during setup, which could run malicious code or payloads",
  "flows": "The obfuscated method calls a subprocess that runs 'sys.executable -m poc_nvk.my_module' during the install process",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names, missing explicit 'import sys', use of a suspicious module name 'poc_nvk.my_module', and execution during setup",
  "analysis": "The code defines an obfuscated class inheriting from setuptools' install, overrides a method that calls a subprocess executing 'poc_nvk.my_module' with 'sys.executable'. The obfuscation and execution pattern are suspicious, indicating potential malicious intent. The missing 'import sys' would cause runtime errors unless fixed, but the pattern suggests an attempt to hide malicious behavior. The subprocess call during setup is a common tactic in malicious packages to run arbitrary code. The scores assigned in reports (malware ~0.8, obfuscated ~0.8, security risk ~0.85) are consistent with this pattern. The high suspicion justifies treating this package as potentially malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits strong indicators of malicious intent: obfuscation and execution of an external module during installation. The pattern is typical of malicious or backdoor packages. The scores are justified; caution is advised, and the package should be avoided or further analyzed.",
