The pattern is typical of malicious or backdoor packages. The scores are justified; caution is advised, and the package should be avoided or further analyzed."

Overall security risk is moderate (~0.45). The assessments are consistent with the evidence, with slight upward adjustments for suspicion levels in some reports."
