  "flows": "Data from hostname, OS, IP -> HTTP POST request to external server",
  "anomalies": "Silent data exfiltration to hardcoded suspicious URL, minimal error handling, variable naming complexity",
  "analysis": "The code gathers system information and transmits it to an external URL without user consent or encryption. Variable names are obscure, possibly obfuscated. Exception handling is flawed, with an unused exception variable. The URL used is suspicious, indicating potential covert data collection. No malicious payloads or destructive actions are present, but the behavior aligns with reconnaissance or data exfiltration tactics. The exfiltration occurs silently, increasing suspicion. The code's simplicity suggests it could be benign or malicious depending on context, but in supply chain scenarios, it poses a security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs covert system info exfiltration to a suspicious URL, indicating malicious intent in a supply chain context. It lacks destructive payloads but demonstrates behavior typical of reconnaissance or data theft scripts. The risk is high, and the malware potential is moderate to high.",
