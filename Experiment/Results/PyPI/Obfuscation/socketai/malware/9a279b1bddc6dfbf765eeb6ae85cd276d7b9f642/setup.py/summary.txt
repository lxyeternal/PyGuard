  "conclusion": "The code exhibits highly suspicious behavior through obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during package setup, indicating a high probability of malicious intent. The high scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified and should be maintained or increased pending further decoding of the payload."
