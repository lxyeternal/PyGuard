      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation and stealthy execution of an encoded PowerShell command, strongly suggesting malicious intent. The use of hidden windows, error suppression, and conditional execution based on filesystem state are typical tactics in malicious scripts. Scores of malware (0.8), obfuscation (0.9), and security risk (0.8) are justified given the evidence. Further decoding of the PowerShell payload is recommended to confirm malicious activity."
