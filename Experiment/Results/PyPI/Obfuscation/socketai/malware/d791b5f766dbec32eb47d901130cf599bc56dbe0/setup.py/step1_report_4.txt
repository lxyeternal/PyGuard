  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package with some embedded obfuscated code that decodes and executes additional code, potentially for malicious purposes.",

    "File reading functions such as SvcDELIGTdhlyTfMtbGEPDRCeQbfjSjc() which reads from a file path",

  "sinks": [
    "exec() function called with code decoded from base64, which executes arbitrary code",

    "Code reads and processes files (possibly configuration or version info)",
    "Base64 string decoded to Python source code",
    "Decoded code is executed via exec()",

  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "Obfuscated code via base64 decoding and dynamic execution",
    "Function names that are non-descriptive and randomly generated",
    "Use of exec() with decoded code, which is a common pattern for malicious obfuscation",
    "Reading version info from a file, possibly for version-based behavior"
  ],
  "analysis": "The script begins with obfuscated, seemingly random variable names and imports, then defines functions for reading files and extracting version info. It then decodes a base64-encoded string, which contains additional Python code, and executes it dynamically with exec(). This pattern is suspicious, as it hides malicious or undesired behavior. The embedded code may perform network connections, system modifications, or data exfiltration, although the exact actions depend on the content of the decoded code. The setup() call indicates this is intended to be a Python package, but the embedded obfuscation raises concerns about hidden malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits obfuscation techniques that suggest it may be malicious or maliciously crafted. The use of base64 decoding combined with exec() to run hidden code is a common indicator of malicious activity. Without executing the decoded code, certainty is limited, but the suspicious pattern warrants caution. The package should not be trusted without further analysis of the decoded content.",
