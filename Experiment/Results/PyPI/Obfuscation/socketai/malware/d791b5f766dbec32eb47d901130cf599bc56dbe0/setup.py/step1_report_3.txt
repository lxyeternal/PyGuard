    "Use of arbitrary variable names that do not clarify intent",
    "Embedded payload that is decoded and executed at import time",
    "Attempt to hide malicious intent through obfuscation"
  ],
  "analysis": "The script begins with standard imports and a function to read files and extract version info, which appear normal. However, it then executes a base64-encoded string that, once decoded, is compiled and run as Python code. This payload is suspicious because it is obfuscated and executed dynamically, which is a common technique to hide malicious activities. The embedded code decodes from base64, compiles, and executes, potentially running malicious code without detection. No explicit network activity or malicious system modifications are directly visible in the static code, but the pattern of obfuscation and dynamic execution strongly suggests malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains obfuscated code that executes dynamically decoded payload, indicating malicious intent likely aimed at hiding malicious activities. The overall behavior is suspicious due to obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and lack of transparency, warranting caution.",
