{
  "purpose": "The script appears to prepare and set up a Python package named 'lhdwif1khefhdlz9' with associated metadata, including versioning and keywords.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from files (via open), embedded base64-encoded strings, and environment variables (potentially).",
  "sinks": "Execution of dynamically decoded and compiled code, especially via exec() on base64-decoded content; reading files; importing modules.",
  "flows": "Reads file contents, decodes base64 string, compiles and executes it, then proceeds with package setup.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64-encoded string that is decoded and executed dynamically is suspicious; obfuscated variable names; unconventional imports; function names are nonsensical; no clear documentation; version string extraction via regex is hidden; potential for malicious code execution hidden within embedded code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules but then decodes a base64-encoded string, which is then compiled and executed dynamically using exec(). This base64 string, when decoded, contains code importing 'tempfile' and 'NamedTemporaryFile' from it, then performing an import from 'urllib.request', and executing code that appears to fetch data from a URL ('http://wasp.plagueu.fun/inject/ISUP8AvHicLUbVI') and potentially run or process that data. The code's obfuscated structure and dynamic execution suggest malicious intent, such as retrieving and executing remote payloads or backdoors. The setup process includes harmless-looking package metadata, but the embedded code could perform malicious actions upon package import or installation. The usage of obscure variable names and encoding strongly indicates an attempt to hide malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains obfuscated code that dynamically executes a remote payload, indicating malicious intent. The presence of encoded, executable code hidden within the package setup process is suspicious and could compromise systems upon installation. Overall, this code should be considered malicious with high confidence.",
