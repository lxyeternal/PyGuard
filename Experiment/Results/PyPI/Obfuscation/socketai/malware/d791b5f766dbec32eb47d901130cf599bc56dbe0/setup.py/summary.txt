  "conclusion": "The code contains a heavily obfuscated, dynamically executed payload, which is a strong indicator of malicious activity. The use of exec() on decoded base64 data, especially with a remote URL fetch pattern, warrants high suspicion. The scores assigned in the reports are justified, and the package should be treated as malicious or at least highly suspicious until further analysis confirms its intent."
