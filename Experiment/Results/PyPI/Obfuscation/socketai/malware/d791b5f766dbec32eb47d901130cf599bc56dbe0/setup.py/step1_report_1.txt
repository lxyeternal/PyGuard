{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, handling package metadata and reading files.",
  "sources": "Reading files via 'SvcDELIGTdhlyTfMtbGEPDRCeQbfjSjc', which loads file content; decoding and executing base64-encoded string; importing setup functions from setuptools or distutils.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the base64-decoded code via 'exec', which can run arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "Base64 string is decoded and then executed with 'exec', which may run any code contained in the decoded payload, potentially malicious.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a base64-encoded string that is decoded and executed dynamically; the variable names and functions are obfuscated and nonsensical; no clear documentation or comments explaining this behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, defines functions for reading files and extracting version info, and then decodes and executes an obfuscated payload from a base64 string. The code uses obfuscation tactics, which is suspicious. The 'exec' on decoded base64 data could potentially run malicious code. The rest of the script appears typical for a setup script but is overshadowed by the dangerous dynamic execution. No other malicious indicators like hardcoded credentials or network activity are evident outside this obfuscation. The obfuscation suggests an attempt to hide malicious or unauthorized code.",
  "conclusion": "The code's core concern is the execution of the obfuscated payload via base64 decoding and 'exec', which is a significant security risk. The obfuscation and dynamic code execution are suspicious and could potentially contain malicious behavior. The script's overall purpose appears to be installing a package but includes a hidden, potentially malicious payload that executes at runtime.",
