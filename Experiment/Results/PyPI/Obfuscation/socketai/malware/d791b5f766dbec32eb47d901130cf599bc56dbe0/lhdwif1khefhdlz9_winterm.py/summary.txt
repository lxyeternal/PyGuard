  "conclusion": "This code is a heavily obfuscated console utility library that manages console styling, cursor positioning, and buffer operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, but the obfuscation warrants cautious monitoring in supply chain contexts. The low malware risk score is appropriate, with the high obfuscation score justified by the code's obscured identifiers."
