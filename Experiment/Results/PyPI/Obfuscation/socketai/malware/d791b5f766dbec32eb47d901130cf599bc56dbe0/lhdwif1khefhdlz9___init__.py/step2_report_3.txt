  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports identify the code as primarily consisting of import statements from internal modules with obfuscated identifiers.\n- No direct data sinks, network activity, or code execution is observed.\n- The code is very minimal, with only imports and a version string assignment.\n- The obfuscation is consistent across reports, which could be either legitimate code protection or an attempt to hide malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Importing obfuscated symbols, possibly part of a larger package.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity, just obfuscated imports. The confidence (0.6) and malware score (0) are reasonable.\n- **Scores:** \n  - *securityRisk (0.2)*: Slightly elevated, considering obfuscation.\n  - *malware (0)*: Correct, no evidence.\n- **Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1—importing functions/variables with obfuscated names.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No evidence of malicious behavior; obfuscation is suspicious but not conclusive.\n- **Scores:** \n  - *securityRisk (0.3)*: Slightly higher, justified by increased obfuscation concern.\n  - *malware (0.2)*: Slightly elevated but still plausible.\n- **Verdict:** Scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Same pattern—importing obfuscated symbols, defining a version string.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity detected; obfuscation remains a concern but not evidence of malware.\n- **Scores:** \n  - *securityRisk (0.3)*: Appropriate.\n  - *malware (0)*: Correct.\n- **Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Importing obfuscated symbols, setting a version string.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior; obfuscation is noted but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** \n  - *securityRisk (0.2)*: Appropriate.\n  - *malware (0)*: Correct.\n- **Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Similar import pattern with obfuscated identifiers.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No direct malicious activity; pattern consistent with other reports.\n- **Scores:** \n  - *securityRisk (0.2)*: Slightly higher but acceptable.\n  - *malware (0)*: Correct.\n- **Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.2, which aligns with the absence of concrete malicious activity. Given only this fragment, there is no evidence of malware.\n- **Obfuscated score:** High (0.7-0.8), justified by the nonsensical import names.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly elevated due to obfuscation but not indicative of active malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **My final evaluation:**\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — no evidence of malicious activity.  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0.8 — high obfuscation, consistent across reports.  \n**Risk score:** 0.3 — moderate, considering obfuscation but no active malicious indicators.\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- The code is minimal and only involves imports with obfuscated names.  \n- No network, file, or data exfiltration activity is present.  \n- Obfuscation alone does not imply malicious intent, especially in legitimate packages that use internal symbol obfuscation for protection or namespace management.  \n- Without additional context or code, the risk remains low.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Value | Justification                                                  |\n|-----------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0            | No evidence of malicious activity in the provided snippet.    |\n| Obfuscated      | 0.8          | Consistent high obfuscation, justifiably so given the naming. |\n| Security Risk   | 0.3          | Moderate due to obfuscation; no active malicious behavior.   |\n\n**Note:** Continue monitoring the larger codebase for similar patterns. Obfuscation alone warrants caution, but in this isolated snippet, the security risk is low.",
