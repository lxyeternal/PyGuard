{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions and classes for generating ANSI escape sequences for terminal styling, including color and mode control sequences.",
  "sources": "The functions generate escape sequences based on input parameters; class attributes define constants for color codes and modes.",
  "sinks": "No external data input, network activity, or data exfiltration observed; the code only constructs strings for terminal control sequences.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to construct escape sequence strings; no external data flows or untrusted data handling are present.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation through nonsensical variable and class names, dynamic attribute setting, and string concatenation; no documentation or comments.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily for terminal styling, using obfuscated variable names and dynamic string construction to generate ANSI escape sequences. No malicious payloads, network activity, or system modifications are evident. The obfuscation appears to serve concealment or aesthetic purposes rather than malicious intent. The functions and classes do not perform any data exfiltration, privilege escalation, or malicious system interaction. The high obfuscation scores are justified, but they do not indicate malicious behavior. The absence of external communication or harmful system calls supports a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code for terminal styling, heavily obfuscated but without any evidence of malicious activity or security risks. The obfuscation likely aims to conceal the purpose or deter straightforward analysis but does not imply malicious intent. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2), consistent with the analysis.",
