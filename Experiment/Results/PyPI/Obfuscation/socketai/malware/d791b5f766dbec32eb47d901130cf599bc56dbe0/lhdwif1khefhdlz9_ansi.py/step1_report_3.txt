  "purpose": "Obfuscation of ANSI escape sequences and defining classes with numeric constants, potentially for terminal control or hidden functionality.",
  "sources": "The functions qQdvFIBZPfZQHiQkkvYjXFRWqTXPhkfh, AdyHqEEHkNQrfCSGYweZCFEFYfUhAHyf, DDBfurpFAQBjZqddjhmCQreIJIeLdslp, YqIphndlzKPjOYrTBbMfqzopqcpSodXj; class constructors; class variables with numeric values.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of escape sequences for terminal control; no clear data leaks or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "The classes' __init__ methods set class attributes to escape sequences; class methods generate escape codes based on input parameters; no external data flows or untrusted data handling evident.",
  "anomalies": "Code heavily obfuscated via dynamic string construction of escape sequences, with class names and variables that do not reveal their intent; no explicit malicious code, but the obfuscation and lack of documentation are suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script defines multiple escape sequences related to ANSI terminal control, possibly for manipulating terminal output. The functions generate escape codes dynamically, which could be used for controlled display or hiding behaviors. Classes contain numeric constants, and their methods produce escape sequences with parameters, but there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The obfuscation, dynamic string construction, and absence of comments suggest an attempt to hide the true purpose, warranting caution. No external communications, system modifications, or suspicious activity is observed within this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be primarily designed for terminal control through escape sequences with obfuscated structure. While it does not explicitly demonstrate malicious intent, its obfuscation and structure raise suspicion. No direct malware behavior or security risks are evident within this snippet, but further context is needed to fully assess intent.",
