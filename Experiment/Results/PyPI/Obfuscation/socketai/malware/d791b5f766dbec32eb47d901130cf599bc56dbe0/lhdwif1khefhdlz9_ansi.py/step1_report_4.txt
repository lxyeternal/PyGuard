{
  "purpose": "The code appears to generate and manipulate terminal escape sequences and control codes, possibly for customizing terminal output or disguising output formatting.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from class attribute values and string constants defined at the beginning, as well as class and instance attributes.",
  "sinks": "The functions generate ANSI escape sequences which could be used to manipulate terminal display; no external data sinks or network communication observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from attribute values (or constants) through functions that embed these values into escape sequence strings, primarily for terminal formatting purposes.",
  "anomalies": "The code defines numerous obfuscated class attributes with numeric values and methods that generate escape sequences, possibly to disguise their purpose. There are no obvious malicious payloads like network connections, file operations, or system commands. The use of escape sequences might be intended for visual effects, but no direct malicious activity is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily focuses on defining escape sequences and wrapping attribute values into terminal control codes. Class constructors modify attributes with escape sequence functions, which could be used for terminal manipulation. No network, file I/O, or system commands are present. The obfuscation via seemingly random class and variable names suggests an attempt to conceal the code's purpose, but the actual content does not include malicious payloads or suspicious behavior beyond obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be designed for terminal output formatting using ANSI escape codes, with obfuscated class and variable names. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system disruption, or network activity. Its purpose seems benign but obfuscated.",
