  "malware_score": 0.65,
  "security_risk": 0.65,
  "obfuscated": 0.8,
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "conclusion": "The code is suspicious due to its obfuscation, regex-based control sequence parsing, environment checks, and dynamic external function invocation. Although it may serve legitimate terminal handling purposes, its complexity and potential for misuse suggest a high security concern. The overall malware score is estimated at approximately 0.65, reflecting a high probability of malicious behavior, especially if external functions are unsafe or environment variables are manipulated. The obfuscation score is high (~0.75), consistent with the code's opaque structure. The security risk score is around 0.65, indicating a significant threat level that warrants caution and further analysis."
