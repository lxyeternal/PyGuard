      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code contains a heavily obfuscated, dynamically executed payload, which is a strong indicator of malicious activity. The use of exec() on decoded base64 data, especially with a remote URL fetch pattern, warrants high suspicion. The scores assigned in the reports are justified, and the package should be treated as malicious or at least highly suspicious until further analysis confirms its intent."

      "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated set of Windows console API wrappers that do not exhibit malicious behavior or data exfiltration. The high obfuscation score reflects the code's obscured identifiers, but overall, it appears to be utility code for console management. The low malware and risk scores are justified, though obfuscation warrants cautious deployment."

      "obfuscated": 0.8,
      "confidence": 0.85,
      "conclusion": "The code is suspicious due to its obfuscation, regex-based control sequence parsing, environment checks, and dynamic external function invocation. Although it may serve legitimate terminal handling purposes, its complexity and potential for misuse suggest a high security concern. The overall malware score is estimated at approximately 0.65, reflecting a high probability of malicious behavior, especially if external functions are unsafe or environment variables are manipulated. The obfuscation score is high (~0.75), consistent with the code's opaque structure. The security risk score is around 0.65, indicating a significant threat level that warrants caution and further analysis."

      "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with high obfuscation but no concrete evidence of malicious behavior. It is likely part of a larger, possibly protected or internal package. Further review of the complete codebase is recommended if concerns persist, but based solely on this fragment, the security risk is low."

      "conclusion": "The code is primarily designed for output stream redirection and cleanup, with high obfuscation but no explicit malicious activity detected. The potential for misuse exists due to obfuscation and stream control, but based solely on this fragment, it appears benign. The malware score is low, and the security risk is moderate, warranting cautious monitoring if deployed in sensitive environments."

The obfuscation likely aims to conceal the purpose or deter straightforward analysis but does not imply malicious intent. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2), consistent with the analysis."

There are no signs of malicious behavior, but the obfuscation warrants cautious monitoring in supply chain contexts. The low malware risk score is appropriate, with the high obfuscation score justified by the code's obscured identifiers."

      "conclusion": "The code is suspicious due to obfuscation and the immediate invocation of an obfuscated function, which could execute malicious code. However, no direct malicious activity is confirmed. The scores should reflect low malware likelihood but acknowledge obfuscation and potential concealment, with moderate security risk."

      "conclusion": "The code functions as a CLI for styled text output with significant obfuscation. No explicit malicious activity is evident, but the obfuscation and dynamic attribute access could conceal malicious behavior. The scores reflect suspicion due to obfuscation but are justified by the lack of concrete malicious actions. Overall, the code appears benign but warrants caution if sourced from untrusted modules."
