  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and anomalies.",
  "sources": "Use of environment variables, network connections, dynamic code execution (eval(), exec()), hardcoded secrets, and standard input/output.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks through environment variables, network transmission, or file system; dynamic code execution leading to arbitrary command execution.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables and untrusted input flow into eval()/exec() or network functions, potentially leading to malicious actions or data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval()/exec() with untrusted data, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, suspicious network or system commands.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and unsafe dynamic execution, especially with eval()/exec() and hardcoded secrets, indicating potential malicious intent. Some reports show benign patterns with no suspicious activity. The presence of obfuscation and dynamic code execution increases security risk. Scores are adjusted to reflect these behaviors, with malware likelihood set higher where malicious patterns are evident. The overall risk is moderate to high in suspicious cases, consistent with the described behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code in reports 2 and 4 demonstrates behaviors associated with malicious or high-risk activity, such as obfuscation, dynamic execution, and hardcoded secrets, warranting elevated malware and security risk scores. Other reports appear benign. The final assessment assigns a malware score of approximately 0.6 for report 2 and 0.7 for report 4, with obfuscation scores around 0.6, and overall security risk around 0.65–0.75. These scores are consistent with the observed patterns and descriptions.",
