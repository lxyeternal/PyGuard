{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package with an embedded obfuscated malicious payload executed during installation.",
  "sources": "The obfuscated string assigned to 'wopvEaTEcopFEavc' and the large numeric string 'iOpvEoeaaeavocp' used for deobfuscation and dynamic code execution.",
  "sinks": "The 'eval(compile(...))' statement which executes dynamically decrypted code, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.",
  "flows": "The code reads obfuscated strings, decrypts them via XOR with a large numeric string, then compiles and executes the resulting code at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated, encrypted payload that is decrypted at runtime and executed via 'eval', which is suspicious and typical of malicious obfuscation. The large encrypted string suggests hidden malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup utilities and defines a custom install command class. During installation, it attempts to decrypt a hardcoded, obfuscated payload using XOR with a large numeric string. After deobfuscation, it compiles and executes the decrypted code dynamically. This pattern indicates malicious intent, as the payload is hidden, decrypted at runtime, and executed without transparency. The rest of the setup script appears standard, but the embedded malicious behavior significantly elevates the risk.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains a hidden malicious payload embedded in obfuscated form, decrypted, compiled, and executed at runtime during package installation. The obfuscation and dynamic execution strongly suggest malicious intent, such as establishing backdoors, executing arbitrary code, or other malicious activities. The overall security risk is high, and the package should be considered unsafe.",
