{
  "purpose": "This code defines a setup script for a Python package with a custom install command that executes obfuscated code during installation.",
  "sources": "The obfuscated code block assigned to 'wopvEaTEcopFEavc' and the encrypted string 'iOpvEoeaaeavocp'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the dynamically decoded code via eval(compile(...)), which can lead to arbitrary code execution.",
  "flows": "The obfuscated string is decoded through XOR with a repeating key, then executed via eval(compile()), allowing arbitrary code to run during installation.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a large, unreadable, obfuscated string and a seemingly random numeric string; use of eval on dynamically decoded code; no clear reason for obfuscation or encryption; the code attempts to run during setup installation.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom install command that, when run, attempts to decode a large obfuscated string through XOR with a repeating key derived from a numeric string. After decoding, it executes the code via eval(compile()), which is a common tactic for obfuscating malicious payloads. The presence of obfuscation, dynamic code execution during installation, and lack of transparency strongly suggest malicious intent. The code does not interact with inputs or environment variables in a transparent or safe manner; instead, it hides potentially harmful code that executes automatically upon package installation. These characteristics are typical of supply chain malware designed to execute arbitrary malicious actions when the package is installed.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, dynamically decoded code executed during installation, indicating malicious intent. The overall structure suggests it is malicious software aimed at executing hidden code during package setup, which could lead to system compromise.",
