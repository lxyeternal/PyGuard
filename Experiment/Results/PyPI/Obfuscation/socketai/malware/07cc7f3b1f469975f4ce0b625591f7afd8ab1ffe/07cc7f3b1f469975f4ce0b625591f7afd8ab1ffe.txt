      "conclusion": "The code in reports 2 and 4 demonstrates behaviors associated with malicious or high-risk activity, such as obfuscation, dynamic execution, and hardcoded secrets, warranting elevated malware and security risk scores. Other reports appear benign. The final assessment assigns a malware score of approximately 0.6 for report 2 and 0.7 for report 4, with obfuscation scores around 0.6, and overall security risk around 0.65–0.75. These scores are consistent with the observed patterns and descriptions."
