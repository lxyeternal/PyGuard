  "conclusion": "The code is benign and functions as a standard setup script. The main concerns are the suspicious package name and external URL, which could introduce supply chain risks if the archive is malicious. No evidence of malware or obfuscation is found. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; a conservative risk score of around 0.3 is justified due to the external dependency. Verification of the external URL's content is recommended before trusting the package."
