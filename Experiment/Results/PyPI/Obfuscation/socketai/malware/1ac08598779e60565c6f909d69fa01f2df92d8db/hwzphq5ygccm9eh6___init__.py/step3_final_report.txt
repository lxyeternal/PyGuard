  "flows": "Download from URL -> Save to AppData directory -> Execute file via subprocess",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names, hardcoded URL, immediate execution without validation",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves a remote executable from a fixed URL, writes it to a user directory, and runs it without any integrity check or user consent. Variable names are obfuscated, likely to conceal malicious intent. The pattern matches typical malware droppers, posing high security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by silently downloading and executing external code without validation, indicating high probability of malware. Obfuscated variable names further suggest concealment. The overall security risk is very high.",
