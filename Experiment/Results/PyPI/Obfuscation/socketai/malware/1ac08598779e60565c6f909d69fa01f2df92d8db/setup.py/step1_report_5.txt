  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, defining metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only defines static variables and calls setup().",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no data leaks or malicious actions are evident.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: static variable definitions followed by setup() invocation with fixed parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The variable names appear obfuscated or randomly generated, but this is likely harmless. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and calls setup() with fixed package metadata. Variables are assigned but not used for any dynamic or malicious purposes. The package name and version are arbitrary. No external data is processed, and no code execution or malicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign setup script with obfuscated variable names that do not indicate malicious intent. No malware or security risks are detected.",
