  "purpose": "To define and configure a Python package setup using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Input data from the setup() function arguments and variable assignments.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function call where package metadata and requirements are specified.",
  "flows": "Variable assignments (e.g., version and name) to setup() parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated or non-descriptive variable names; no clear malicious code, but variable names and structure are unusual and obscure intent.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports 'setup' and 'find_packages' from setuptools, assigns several variables with seemingly random or obfuscated names, and calls setup() with package metadata. The variables are used directly in the setup() call. There is no apparent malicious payload, network activity, or backdoor code. The code appears to be a standard package setup script with obfuscated variable names, which could be a minimal attempt at hiding intent. No suspicious data handling, input/output, or harmful behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names, which could be an attempt at hiding purpose but contains no malicious or harmful code. It solely configures package metadata without any malicious behavior.",
