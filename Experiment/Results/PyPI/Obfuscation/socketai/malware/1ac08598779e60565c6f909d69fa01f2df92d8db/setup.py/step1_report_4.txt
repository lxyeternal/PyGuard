  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, defining metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Variables assigned at the beginning (e.g., version, package name, classifiers).",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; setup function parameters are standard.",
  "flows": "Variables are used as arguments in the setup() function, but none involve untrusted input or data flow that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variable names; no meaningful comments; unusual variable naming with seemingly random strings. The code appears to be intentionally obfuscated or generated to conceal details.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and defines several variables with obfuscated names assigned to static strings, likely to mask their purpose. The setup() function is called with parameters referencing these variables, but all values are static and standard. There are no inputs, network calls, or dynamic executions that could be malicious. The obfuscation might suggest an attempt to conceal the package's purpose, but no malicious actions are evident. The code is minimal, standard for a setup script, with unusual variable names that could be benign or a red flag for obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard setup.py file with obfuscated variable names, likely to conceal some details. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The obfuscation could be benign or a minor red flag, but no actual malicious activity is detected.",
