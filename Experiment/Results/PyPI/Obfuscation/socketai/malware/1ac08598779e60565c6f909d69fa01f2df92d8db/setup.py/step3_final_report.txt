{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for a Python package, obfuscated with non-descriptive variable names, assigning static strings and used in the setup() call.",
  "sources": "Static variable assignments for package metadata (name, version, classifiers, etc.)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; no data leaks or malicious effects observed",
  "flows": "Variables assigned static data and directly passed to setup(), with no dynamic or external data flow",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, but no malicious code, network activity, or dynamic execution present",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script with obfuscated variable names, which do not introduce malicious behavior. All variables are static, and no external input or network activity occurs. The obfuscation appears superficial and does not imply malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0, risk 0.1-0.2, obfuscated 0.6-0.8) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated setup script with no malicious payloads or security risks. The obfuscation is superficial and does not indicate malicious intent. The scores across reports are justified and appropriate.",
