{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract and steal sensitive user information such as Discord tokens, passwords, cookies, browser data, and other personal data from a user's system, then upload the collected data to remote servers or webhooks.",
  "sources": "Input sources include user environment variables, local files (browser databases, local storage, cookies, login data), and network responses from Discord API endpoints, IPify, and other web requests.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows into remote webhooks, requests to external servers (transfer.sh, discord API, custom URLs), and file uploads via HTTP POST, leading to data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Data is collected from local browser storage, cookies, login databases, and Discord tokens; then decrypted and aggregated; finally sent over HTTP requests to webhook URLs and transfer.sh links.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Discord webhook URL, extensive use of reflection and dynamic imports, code that attempts to silently install modules, and multiple functions designed explicitly for credential theft and data exfiltration. Use of obfuscation or misleading imports is not explicit but the code structure and purpose are suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by importing necessary modules, some of which are dynamically installed, indicating an intent to avoid missing dependencies. It contains functions to retrieve IP address, decrypt stored credentials and cookies from Chromium-based browsers, and collect Discord-related data such as tokens, user info, badges, billing info, and friends list. It also searches common directories for stored passwords, cookies, and wallet data, zips and uploads them. The presence of hardcoded webhook URLs, extensive data exfiltration routines, and credential harvesting strongly suggests malicious intent. The code is structured to run silently in the background, gathering sensitive info without user consent and transmitting it externally. The overall design indicates malicious spyware or stealer behavior, with no legitimate purpose evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious intent, functioning as a credential and data stealer targeting browser data, Discord tokens, wallets, and other personal information. Its techniques include decryption of stored credentials, system information gathering, and exfiltration through webhooks and file uploads. The code is highly suspicious and should be considered malware.",
