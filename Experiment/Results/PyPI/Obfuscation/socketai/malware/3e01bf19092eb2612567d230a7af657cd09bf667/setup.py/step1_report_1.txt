{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a malicious stealer designed to extract sensitive information such as Discord tokens, passwords, cookies, and other personal data from various browsers and applications, then exfiltrate the data via Discord webhooks or transfer services.",
  "sources": "Input sources include local browser and application data files, log files, cookies, local storage, and environment variables for tokens, passwords, cookies, and IP address fetching via web requests.",
  "sinks": "Data exfiltration occurs through requests to Discord webhooks, transfer.sh file uploads, and requests to various online services. Sensitive data like tokens, passwords, cookies, and system info are sent over the network.",
  "flows": "Untrusted data such as browser database files, log files, environment variables, and memory data flows into decryption and parsing functions, then into exfiltration functions that send the data to remote servers.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes obfuscated import statements, dynamic package installation, use of Discord webhooks for data exfiltration, automated data extraction from browsers and apps, and use of cryptographic functions for decrypting stored credentials. It also employs threading for concurrent data collection. The code structure and functions are typical of a stealer or malware, not legitimate software.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing numerous modules, some of which are imported dynamically or forcibly installed. It defines functions to gather system IP, decrypt stored credentials, retrieve Discord tokens, and extract cookies/passwords from browsers. It uses regex to find tokens and decrypts them, then gathers user info, billing info, badges, and friends from Discord, which indicates credential theft. It then uploads data via webhooks or anonymously hosted file-sharing services. It also searches directories for files with potentially sensitive info, archives them, and uploads the zip files. Multiple threading is used to expedite data collection. The code's primary purpose appears to be stealing user credentials, cookies, and personal info from browsers, Discord, and wallets, then exfiltrating that data covertly. The presence of hardcoded webhook URL, dynamic package installs, decryption routines, and file exfiltration strongly suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious malware designed to extract sensitive user data from browsers, Discord, wallets, and other sources, then send it to external servers via webhooks and file-sharing services. It employs obfuscation and automation to maximize data theft while avoiding detection. It should be considered high-risk and unsuitable for use.",
