{
  "purpose": "This script appears to be a stealer or malicious data extractor targeting Discord tokens, passwords, cookies, and browser data, then exfiltrates this information via webhook or uploads to anonymous file hosts.",
  "sources": "Reads data from browser storage files (Local Storage, leveldb), browser cookies, Discord local files, logins, and other user data files from specific directories, environment variables, and API responses.",
  "sinks": "Sends collected data to a Discord webhook, uploads files to transfer.sh, and sends information through HTTP requests to various endpoints. Also executes commands such as 'taskkill' and installs packages via subprocess, which could be used maliciously.",
  "flows": "Extracts tokens, passwords, cookies from local browser and app files -> decrypts sensitive data -> compiles and uploads/stores the data via HTTP requests, webhooks, and file uploads.",
  "anomalies": "Code imports all functions from 'builtins', executes an empty exec() call, installs packages dynamically, uses hardcoded webhook URL, obfuscates paths, and retrieves sensitive info without user consent. Uses regex patterns that extract tokens and decrypts data with Windows API calls, indicating malicious intent. Also, it kills processes and zips files before uploading, which is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is designed to locate and extract user credentials, cookies, tokens, and browser data from multiple browsers and applications. It decrypts stored credentials using Windows APIs, retrieves Discord user info, and exfiltrates via webhook or anonymous file upload services. The presence of hardcoded webhook URLs, dynamic package installation, process termination, and collection of sensitive data without user knowledge strongly suggest malicious intent. The code structure and multiple threads for parallel processing aim to maximize data theft efficiency, confirming it as a malicious data-stealing tool.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly malicious, functioning as a comprehensive credential and data stealer targeting browsers and Discord. It exfiltrates user data to external services and employs obfuscation and process-killing techniques to avoid detection. The overall security risk is extremely high.",
