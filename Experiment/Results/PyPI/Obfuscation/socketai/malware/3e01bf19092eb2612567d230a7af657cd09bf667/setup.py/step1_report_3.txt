{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a stealer or malware designed to extract user tokens, passwords, cookies, and other sensitive information from various browsers and applications, and then exfiltrate this data via Discord webhooks and file uploads to anonymous file sharing services.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from browser storage paths (Chrome, Opera, Yandex, Brave, Edge), Discord local storage, and wallet files (MetaMask, Exodus, Wallet, NationsGlory, Steam). It also reads environment variables, local database files (Login Data, Cookies), and local state files for decryption keys.",
  "sinks": "The code sends data to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, uploads files to transfer.sh and anonfiles, and executes pip install commands for missing dependencies. It also opens and reads local files and databases, and performs network requests to external APIs (ipify, Discord API).",
  "flows": "Sources include browser storage files, wallet files, environment variables, and local database files. These data sources flow into decryption and parsing functions, which extract tokens, passwords, cookies, and other info. Extracted data then flows into functions that upload or send this data via webhooks or file uploads. The code also spawns threads for parallel data collection.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual use of dynamic environment variables, code that forcibly installs dependencies if missing, and the use of hardcoded webhook URL. The script kills processes related to wallet apps, archives files into ZIPs, and uploads them. It contains obfuscated regex patterns, indirect token extraction, and extensive browser profile parsing. The code also performs unsolicited network requests and decryption routines, which could be misused for malicious purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code is structured as a malicious data exfiltration tool targeting browser credentials, tokens, and wallet information. It uses several techniques to access local browser data, decrypt encrypted tokens (e.g., using Windows DataProtection API and AES-GCM), and gather user information. It uploads this data to a remote webhook, likely for malicious exploitation. The presence of functions like 'GetToken', 'getPassw', 'getCookie', 'GetDiscord', and 'uploadToken' all point to credential theft. Additionally, the script kills process for wallet apps and zips files for exfiltration. The setup call at the end loads dependencies and triggers the whole process, indicating an intent to run silently upon execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and appears to be malicious malware designed for credential theft and data exfiltration. It targets browsers, wallets, and applications, and communicates with a remote webhook. Its structure and behavior are consistent with known stealer malware. The use of hardcoded URLs, process termination, and extensive local data parsing further reinforce malicious intent.",
