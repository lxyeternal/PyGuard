  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple script that performs data processing or a basic utility function, with no explicit purpose or context provided.",
  "sources": "Reading input data from command-line arguments, environment variables, or external files (if present in the code).",
  "sinks": "Potentially writing data to files, printing output, or network communication if present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (user input, environment variables, files) to sinks (outputs, network transmission).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are evident. No obfuscated code or unusual language features detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with standard data processing or utility functions. No signs of malicious intent, such as data exfiltration, network connections to suspicious domains, or system modifications. Usage of third-party libraries appears typical. No suspicious behaviors, code injections, or malicious logic are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs typical data handling tasks without any suspicious or malicious intent.",
