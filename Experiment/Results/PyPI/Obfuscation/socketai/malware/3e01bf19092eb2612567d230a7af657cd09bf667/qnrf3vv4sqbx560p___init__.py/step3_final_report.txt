  "purpose": "Assess the supply chain security of the open source Python dependency by analyzing code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include code snippets, environment variables, network operations, and data processing functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks involve network connections, file operations, environment variable access, and data transmission points.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as user input or environment variables to sinks like network sockets or file writes, with no suspicious patterns detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns are present; code appears standard and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets are either minimal, standard data processing scripts, or involve network operations without evidence of malicious intent. Malware scores are consistently 0, obfuscation scores are 0, and security risk scores are low (0.2), reflecting benign assessments. Confidence levels are high (0.8-0.9), supporting the conclusion of no malicious activity. Given the lack of suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors, the scores are appropriate and consistent with the descriptions.",
  "conclusion": "All reports accurately identify the code as benign with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The current scoring is justified; no modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
