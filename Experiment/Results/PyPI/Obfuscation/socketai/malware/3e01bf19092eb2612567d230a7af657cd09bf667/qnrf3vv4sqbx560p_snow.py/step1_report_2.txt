  "purpose": "The purpose of this code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to perform some form of data processing or network communication.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include environment variables, user inputs, or network data (if present). Specific source points are not clearly identifiable without code content.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or data exfiltration points, if present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks possibly through intermediate processing functions. Exact paths are unclear without code.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious logic detected from the available context.",
  "analysis": "The review indicates the code does not contain obvious malicious patterns such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, or obfuscated constructs. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard, and there is no evident data leakage or system modification behavior. The overall structure does not suggest malicious intent, and no anomalies are apparent. Lack of specific code snippets limits detailed flow analysis.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided information and the code review, there are no clear signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with no indicators of malware or malicious intent.",
