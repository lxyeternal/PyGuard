  "sinks": "No sensitive sinks such as network connections, file writes, or environment variable modifications are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks, as the code does not handle external data.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no suspicious or unusual constructs, obfuscation, or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a simple print statement that outputs a static message. There are no external data inputs, no data processing, and no operations that could compromise security. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or malicious code patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a basic output function without any malicious intent or security risks.",
