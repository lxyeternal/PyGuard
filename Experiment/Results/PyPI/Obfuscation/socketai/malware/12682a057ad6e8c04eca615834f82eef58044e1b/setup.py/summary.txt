  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during package setup. The pattern aligns with common malware techniques involving stealth, obfuscation, and remote code execution. It should be treated as malicious or highly suspicious until further decoding of the payload confirms its intent."
