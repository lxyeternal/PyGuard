{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a minimal, straightforward utility or sample snippet with no malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input, environment variables, or data sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present; the code is static and self-contained.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and benign, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2) are consistent with the analysis. Confidence levels vary but are appropriate given the limited context. No suspicious behaviors or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk score (0.2) is justified, though it could be slightly lowered to 0.1 considering the minimal threat level. Overall, the assessments are accurate and consistent.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.1,
