  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior: it covertly collects sensitive system information, encodes and transmits it to an external server during package installation, with obfuscation to hide intent. The external URL is suspicious, and the pattern aligns with known data exfiltration tactics. Scores of malware 0.95, obfuscated 0.9, and security risk 0.95 are justified given the activity."
