{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform system information gathering, environment inspection, and data exfiltration during installation of a Python package, likely as part of a malicious supply chain attack.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables, hostname, current directory, user info, network interfaces, and IP addresses. It also accesses local directories.",
  "sinks": "The code sends collected data via an HTTP POST request to an external domain (https://425a2.rt11.ml), potentially exfiltrating system information.",
  "flows": "Data is gathered from system environment, network interfaces, and local directories (sources), then processed, encoded, and sent over the network to an external server (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, hex encoding of environment and system data, dynamic hostname resolution with crafted URL, and POST request to a suspicious domain. The code collects extensive system info and transmits it unencrypted.",
  "analysis": "The script imports several modules and defines functions to collect IP addresses, local directory listings, and environment details. It encodes sensitive info (hostname, user, IPs) into hex, constructs a URL with encoded hostname and IP info, then attempts to resolve this URL to an IP address, possibly as a check or trigger. It then creates a JSON payload with system details and sends it to a suspicious external domain. The setup() call with a custom install class indicates this code runs during package installation, potentially without user consent. The obfuscated variable names and hex encoding suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent. The network activity (POST to external domain) is a key malicious indicator.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates malicious behavior typical of data exfiltration malware embedded in a package setup script. It gathers extensive system information and transmits it to an external server during installation, indicating a high security risk.",
