{
  "purpose": "The code appears to gather system information such as hostname, IP addresses, current working directory, and user details, then send this data to an external server during installation.",
  "sources": "Input sources include system commands (hostname, current directory, username), environment variables, network interfaces, and possibly user-provided directories.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent via an HTTP POST request to an external server ('https://425a2.rt11.ml'). The data includes hostname, IP addresses, username, and directory info.",
  "flows": "Data flows from system information collection functions (e.g., socket.gethostname(), getpass.getuser(), netifaces) into a JSON payload, which is then transmitted via requests.post() to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, dynamic hostname/IP collection, encoding of environment variables and paths, and the use of hex encoding for sensitive data. The code also performs DNS resolution with a custom domain, which could be suspicious. The external URL ('https://425a2.rt11.ml') is not recognized and could be malicious. The code also collects and transmits detailed system info during installation.",
  "analysis": "The code uses obfuscated variable names and dynamically collects system data, including hostname, IP addresses (both IPv4 and IPv6), current working directory, and username. It encodes some data in hex and constructs a custom hostname string that includes encoded path segments, then attempts to resolve this hostname. The data is packaged into a JSON object and sent to an external server via HTTP POST during the setup process. The use of obfuscation, encoding, and external data transmission strongly suggests malicious intent, particularly as the data collected can be used for tracking or reconnaissance. The external server URL appears suspicious and could be involved in malicious activities. There are no explicit hardcoded credentials, but the overall behavior indicates potential privacy invasion or malware behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is potentially malicious, performing system reconnaissance and exfiltration of system information during installation without user consent. The obfuscation, external communication to an untrusted domain, and data collection methods point toward malicious intent. It is highly recommended to avoid using this package.",
