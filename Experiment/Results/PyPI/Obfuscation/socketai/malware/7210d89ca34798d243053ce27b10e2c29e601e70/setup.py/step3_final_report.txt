{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information (hostname, current directory, username, IP addresses), encodes this data, constructs a hostname, attempts DNS resolution, and exfiltrates the data via an HTTP POST request to an external suspicious domain during package installation. Its obfuscated variable names and encoding suggest malicious intent.",
  "sources": "os.listdir, os.getcwd, getpass.getuser, netifaces interfaces, environment variables, hostname resolution",
  "sinks": "requests.post to external URL, DNS resolution on constructed hostname",
  "flows": "Data collected from system functions, encoded in hex, assembled into payload, DNS resolution on hostname, HTTP POST request transmitting data",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of variable names, extensive hex encoding of data, external network communication during setup, DNS resolution to suspicious domain, data collection without user consent",
  "analysis": "The code is a setup script that defines a custom install class. During installation, it gathers system info such as hostname, current directory, username, and network IPs. It encodes these pieces of data in hex, constructs a hostname with encoded segments, and attempts DNS resolution on this hostname. It then creates a JSON payload with the collected data and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a suspicious external domain. The variable names are intentionally obfuscated, and encoding is used to hide malicious intent. The external URL and data exfiltration pattern strongly indicate malicious activity, likely for covert data theft or reconnaissance. The code runs during package installation, which is unusual and suspicious, further suggesting malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior: it covertly collects sensitive system information, encodes and transmits it to an external server during package installation, with obfuscation to hide intent. The external URL is suspicious, and the pattern aligns with known data exfiltration tactics. Scores of malware 0.95, obfuscated 0.9, and security risk 0.95 are justified given the activity.",
