  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates high malicious potential, executing an obfuscated PowerShell command stealthily during setup. The use of encoded commands, hidden execution, and error suppression aligns with common malware tactics. Scores of malware (0.9), obfuscation (0.9), and security risk (0.9) are justified. The overall assessment indicates a high likelihood of malicious activity requiring further investigation or mitigation."
