{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be setting up a Python package using setuptools, but it includes a custom installation step that downloads and executes a file from an external URL.",
  "sources": "The URL 'https://tryg.ga/normal.exe' is used as a source for downloading an executable file during installation.",
  "sinks": "The downloaded 'normal.exe' is executed immediately after download using Popen, which executes external code without verification.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the URL source to the download function (urllib.request.urlretrieve), then from the downloaded file to execution via Popen.",
  "anomalies": "The class name is obfuscated and unusual; the method name is also non-descriptive. The setup parameters include nonsensical keys such as 'czYrIkMbtUKuSYHzqRsTDJdAGqEGdFGD' and 'KqyPsyJqOIpTefsnwUCFEpWNhrDbNQXD'. The code downloads and runs an external executable during setup, which is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup tools but then defines a custom install class with a method that downloads an executable from an external URL and runs it immediately. This behavior is characteristic of malicious supply chain attacks, as it allows arbitrary code execution during package installation. The use of obfuscated class and variable names further suggests malicious intent. The setup parameters are malformed or deliberately obfuscated, indicating potential malicious obfuscation or sabotage. The download and execution of an external executable without verification constitutes a serious security risk, potentially installing malware on systems where this package is installed.",
  "conclusion": "This code demonstrates malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external executable during package installation. The obfuscation and unusual setup parameters reinforce suspicion of malicious intent, posing a high security risk if used. It should be considered unsafe and potentially malicious.",
