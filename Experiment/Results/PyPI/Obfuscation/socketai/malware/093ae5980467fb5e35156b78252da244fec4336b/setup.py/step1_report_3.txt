{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be a setup script for a Python package, with an added custom installation step.",
  "sources": "The code retrieves a file from a remote URL ('https://tryg.ga/normal.exe') using urllib.request.urlretrieve during the installation process.",
  "sinks": "The retrieved 'normal.exe' is executed immediately via Popen(['normal.exe']), which runs the downloaded executable on the host system.",
  "flows": "Source: URL retrieval ('https://tryg.ga/normal.exe') -> sink: execution with Popen(['normal.exe']) during the install process.",
  "anomalies": "The class name is obfuscated, and the method name is non-descriptive. The download URL points to a suspicious domain. The executable is fetched and run during setup, which is highly unusual and potentially malicious. The setup parameters are also obfuscated with random variable names, and the code ignores the actual setup configuration, focusing on downloading and executing external code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a modified setup script that includes a malicious payload. During installation, it downloads an executable from an external, suspicious URL and runs it silently, potentially installing malware. The obfuscated class and method names, along with the hardcoded URL, indicate malicious intent. The script does not perform any legitimate setup tasks beyond this malicious behavior. The use of Popen to execute the downloaded file suggests an attempt to silently run malicious code on the user's system. The overall structure is designed to disguise malicious activity within a seemingly legitimate setup process.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and likely malicious, as it downloads and executes a remote executable during installation. This behavior constitutes a security threat and should be considered malware. The package should not be used.",
