{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, with an unusual custom installation command that downloads and executes an external executable file.",
  "sources": "The code retrieves a file from 'https://tryg.ga/normal.exe' via urllib.request.urlretrieve during the installation process.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'normal.exe' using Popen, which runs the downloaded file on the user's system.",
  "flows": "The installation process downloads 'normal.exe' from the specified URL (source) and then executes it (sink), potentially executing malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "The class name is obfuscated and does not follow typical naming conventions; the method 'eAeDfPQeRwmCSBgBrVNkvenVnTxqCWDk' is unusually complex and obfuscated. The setup parameters contain non-standard, seemingly random keys (e.g., 'czYrIkMbtUKuSYHzqRsTDJdAGqEGdFGD') and version comparison syntax '>=3.6' is incorrectly formatted. These are common signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define a package setup process. A custom install class is defined, which on execution downloads an executable from an external URL and then runs it. The download URL points to an external site, potentially malicious. The code includes obfuscated class and method names, which could be an attempt to hide malicious activity. The setup configuration contains suspicious keys and malformed syntax, indicating possible obfuscation or tampering. The core malicious behavior is the download and execution of external code during package installation, representing a significant security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code attempts to download and execute an external executable during package installation, which is a high-security risk. The obfuscation and external download strongly suggest malicious intent, potentially a supply chain attack or malicious backdoor. This package should not be used.",
