  "purpose": "The script appears to be a setup configuration for a Python package, with an embedded malicious behavior that downloads and executes a file from an external URL during installation.",

  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command class that, upon execution, retrieves a file from an external URL and executes it. This behavior is embedded within the setup script, meaning it will run whenever the package is installed. The use of obfuscated class and method names suggests an attempt to hide malicious intent. The download URL points to an executable which, if malicious, could harm the user’s system. The code accesses external resources and executes them without any user warning or consent, constituting a supply chain attack.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script contains malicious behavior designed to download and run a remote executable during installation. The obfuscation and external code execution indicate malicious intent. This package should be considered unsafe and should not be used.",
