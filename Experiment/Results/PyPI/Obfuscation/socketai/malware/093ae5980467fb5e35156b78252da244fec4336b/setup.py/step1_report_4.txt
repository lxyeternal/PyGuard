{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, with an embedded malicious payload that downloads and executes an external executable.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'README.md' file, but the primary source of potentially malicious behavior is the custom install class which retrieves an executable from a remote URL.",
  "sinks": "The malicious executable ('normal.exe') is downloaded and run via Popen, which could execute arbitrary code on the system.",
  "flows": "Input from the code (triggered during installation) leads to downloading a remote file, then executing that file, which constitutes a direct source-to-sink malicious flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class and method names, unconventional variable names, and the download and execution of an external executable during installation are significant anomalies. The code also includes invalid or intentionally obfuscated setup parameters (e.g., 'czYrIkMbtUKuSYHzqRsTDJdAGqEGdFGD' and 'KqyPsyJqOIpTefsnwUCFEpWNhrDbNQXD') that resemble obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools but defines a custom install class that overrides a method to download and execute an external file, which is suspicious behavior. The code attempts to retrieve 'https://tryg.ga/normal.exe' and run it without any user consent or verification. Obfuscated class/method names and irregular setup parameters suggest an intent to hide malicious actions. The use of try-except blocks around the download and execution indicates an attempt to silently handle errors, potentially to avoid detection. The rest of the setup configuration appears standard, but the embedded malicious payload is the critical concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains clear malicious intent, designed to download and execute an external executable during package installation, which could compromise the system. The obfuscation and unconventional parameters further support suspicion of malicious activity.",
