  "conclusion": "The majority of the code is benign, with no evidence of malicious payloads or sabotage. The suspicion in report 5 is justified by obfuscation and dynamic features but lacks definitive malicious activity. Scores are generally appropriate; minor adjustments could be made to risk levels in suspicious cases. Overall, the supply chain security posture appears sound based on static analysis."
