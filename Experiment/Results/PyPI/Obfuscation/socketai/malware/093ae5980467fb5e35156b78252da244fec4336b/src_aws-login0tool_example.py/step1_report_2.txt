{
  "purpose": "The function appears to increment a given number by 1, likely for simple data processing or computation.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'number' (potentially untrusted user input).",
  "sinks": "Return statement, outputting the incremented number.",
  "flows": "Input 'number' flows directly to the return statement as 'number + 1'.",
  "anomalies": "Function name is obfuscated and nonsensical; no additional code or external calls present; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function with an obfuscated name, which takes a parameter 'number'. It simply returns the input incremented by 1, with no external interactions or hidden behaviors. The obfuscated name could be an attempt to evade detection, but the logic itself is straightforward and benign. No malicious activities such as network communication, data exfiltration, or file manipulation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal and benign, performing a basic arithmetic operation without any malicious intent or security risks.",
