  "purpose": "A simple function that increments a number by 1, with an obfuscated name.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'number' received by the function.",
  "sinks": "Return statement outputs the incremented number; no external data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Input 'number' flows directly to the return statement after incrementing.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function name; trivial logic; no external calls, secrets, or side effects.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function with an obfuscated name that adds 1 to its input. All reports correctly identify the function as benign, noting the obfuscation but no malicious behavior. Malware scores are consistently zero, and security risk scores are very low, reflecting the harmless nature of the code. The obfuscation score varies but is justified given the function name. The overall behavior is straightforward and does not pose security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, trivial increment function with obfuscated naming. No malicious activity or vulnerabilities are present. The obfuscation is superficial and not indicative of malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, though the obfuscation score could be standardized around 0.7 due to the obfuscated name. Overall, the code is safe and harmless.",
