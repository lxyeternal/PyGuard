{
  "purpose": "A simple function that increments a given number by 1.",
  "sources": "The function takes an input parameter 'number'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sink operations; the function only returns a computed value.",
  "flows": "Input 'number' flows into the addition operation and then is returned.",
  "anomalies": "The function name appears obfuscated, but the code itself is straightforward. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious operations are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function with a highly obfuscated name that adds 1 to its input. The implementation is trivial, with no external input/output, network operations, or file interactions. The obfuscated name could suggest an attempt to hide intent, but the logic itself is benign. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious side effects are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a simple arithmetic operation with an obfuscated name but no malicious behavior. It appears harmless and likely intended for basic processing.",
