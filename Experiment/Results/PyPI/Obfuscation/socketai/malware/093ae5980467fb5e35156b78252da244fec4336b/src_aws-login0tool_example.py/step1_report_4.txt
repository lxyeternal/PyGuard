  "purpose": "A simple function that increments a number by 1",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'number' to the function",
  "sinks": "Return statement outputs the incremented number",
  "flows": "Input 'number' -> addition operation -> output returned",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code observed",
  "analysis": "The function name appears intentionally obfuscated but the code itself performs a straightforward addition operation. It takes a single input and returns the input incremented by 1. No external data, network calls, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is minimal, and there are no signs of malicious intent or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign function with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It appears to be intentionally obfuscated only by the function name, but the logic is harmless.",
