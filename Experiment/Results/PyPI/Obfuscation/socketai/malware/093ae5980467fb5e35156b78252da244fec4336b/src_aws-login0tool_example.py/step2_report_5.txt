  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the original code and considering the scores assigned.\n\n**Original Code:**\n```python\ndef EWnnkHTjoJWZGFBTGdwcttmGPmJHnzLK(number):\n    return number + 1\n```\nThe code is a simple function that adds 1 to its input, with an obfuscated function name.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Simple increment function.\n- **Analysis:** The report notes the obfuscated name but benign logic.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.8, Obfuscated 0.7, Malware 0, Security Risk 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The function is straightforward, and no malicious behavior is detected. The obfuscation might be to hide intent, but given the simplicity, it's not suspicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** Similar reasoning, with a note that 'number' could be untrusted input, but no external operations.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.9, Obfuscated 0.7, Malware 0, Security Risk 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly higher confidence, but the security risk score is 0.1, perhaps considering minimal risk if 'number' is untrusted. Given the code, this is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Same.\n- **Analysis:** Reiterates the benign nature, mentions no external I/O.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.9, Obfuscated 0.2, Malware 0, Security Risk 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The obfuscated score is lower here (0.2), which seems inconsistent with previous reports that assign 0.7. Since the obfuscation is similar, the obfuscated score should be consistent across reports. I suggest maintaining a higher obfuscation score (around 0.7) for consistency.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Same.\n- **Analysis:** Similar reasoning, with mention that the obfuscation is only in the name.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.9, Obfuscated 0.7, Malware 0, Security Risk 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with earlier reports.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Same.\n- **Analysis:** Confirms no malicious behavior, notes the function name is randomly generated.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 1, Obfuscated 0, Malware 0, Security Risk 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Here, the obfuscated score is 0, which conflicts with previous reports. Given the obfuscated name, a score of 0.7 seems more appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation:**\n\n- **Code presence:** The code matches the description; it's a simple increment function with an obfuscated name.\n- **Malware:** No evidence of malicious behavior. All reports agree.\n- **Obfuscation:** The function name is obfuscated, which could be an attempt to hide intent, but the logic is trivial and benign.\n- **Risk scores:** The risk is minimal; scores of 0 or 0.1 are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n\n- The **obfuscated** score should be consistent across reports. Since the function name is obfuscated, a score of **0.7** is justified.\n- The **malware** score remains **0**.\n- The **security risk** is minimal; a score of **0.1** in some reports is acceptable, but overall, it remains low.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0.7** (function name is obfuscated, which could be for evasion)\n- **Risk:** **0.1** (minimal, mostly due to obfuscation, but the logic is harmless)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe code is a trivial, benign function with obfuscated naming. The current assessments are generally correct, but the obfuscation scores should be harmonized to reflect the consistent obfuscated nature of the function name. No evidence suggests malicious intent or behavior.",
