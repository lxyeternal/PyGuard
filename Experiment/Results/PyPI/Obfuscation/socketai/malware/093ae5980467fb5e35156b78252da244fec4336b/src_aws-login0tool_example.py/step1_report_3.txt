  "purpose": "Simple function to increment a given number by 1",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'number'",
  "sinks": "Return statement, outputting the incremented number",
  "flows": "Input 'number' flows to the return statement as 'number + 1'",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and minimal",
  "analysis": "The function named EWnnkHTjoJWZGFBTGdwcttmGPmJHnzLK takes a single parameter 'number' and returns 'number + 1'. The function name appears obfuscated or nonsensical but is not inherently malicious. No external input reading beyond the parameter occurs. The code does not perform any network operations, file I/O, or use of environment variables. There are no hidden or suspicious behaviors, no hardcoded credentials, and no obfuscated code features beyond the nonsensical name.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, harmless function to increment a number, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
