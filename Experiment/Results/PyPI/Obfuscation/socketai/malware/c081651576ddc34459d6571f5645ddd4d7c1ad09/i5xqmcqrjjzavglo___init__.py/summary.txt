  "security_risk": 0.7,
  "obfuscated": 0.4,
  "confidence": 0.75,
  "conclusion": "The code shows moderate suspicion due to patterns indicative of obfuscation and potential malicious behavior, primarily eval()/exec() usage, hardcoded secrets, and dynamic imports. The scores are consistent with these findings, with a recommendation to slightly increase malware and obfuscation scores to better reflect the potential risk. The overall security risk remains moderate, emphasizing the need for further detailed analysis before deployment."
