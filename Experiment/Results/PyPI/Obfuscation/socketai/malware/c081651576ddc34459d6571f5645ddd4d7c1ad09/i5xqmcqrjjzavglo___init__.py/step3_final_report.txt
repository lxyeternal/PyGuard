  "purpose": "Analysis of suspicious code patterns indicating potential malicious behavior or obfuscation, focusing on eval()/exec(), hardcoded secrets, dynamic imports, and control flow complexity.",
  "sources": "Untrusted input sources such as user input, environment variables, network data, or files.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources feeding into eval()/exec(), dynamic imports, or unvalidated data reaching network or file sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval()/exec(), hardcoded secrets, dynamic imports, complex control flow, obfuscation-like structures, or untrusted input handling.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits patterns commonly associated with obfuscation and malicious intent, such as dynamic code execution and hardcoded secrets. The suspicion is supported by the presence of eval()/exec(), complex control flow, and dynamic imports, which can facilitate malicious payloads or conceal malicious behavior. The obfuscation score of 0.4 reflects moderate suspicion, and the malware score of 0.4 indicates potential concern but not definitive malicious activity. The security risk score of 0.6 appropriately flags the potential for exploitation if such code is executed with untrusted input. The confidence level of 0.75 aligns with the suspicion based on code patterns but acknowledges the lack of definitive malicious payloads. Overall, the code warrants cautious review, and the scores should be adjusted slightly upward to reflect the identified suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows moderate suspicion due to patterns indicative of obfuscation and potential malicious behavior, primarily eval()/exec() usage, hardcoded secrets, and dynamic imports. The scores are consistent with these findings, with a recommendation to slightly increase malware and obfuscation scores to better reflect the potential risk. The overall security risk remains moderate, emphasizing the need for further detailed analysis before deployment.",
