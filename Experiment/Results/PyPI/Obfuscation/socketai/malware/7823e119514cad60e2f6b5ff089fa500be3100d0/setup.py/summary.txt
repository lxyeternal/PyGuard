  "conclusion": "The code contains a high likelihood of malicious behavior, executing an obfuscated PowerShell command covertly during setup. The obfuscation, silent execution, and conditional trigger are red flags indicating potential malware or malicious activity. Further decoding of the PowerShell command is recommended to confirm its intent. The overall security risk is high, and the package should be flagged for review or removal."
