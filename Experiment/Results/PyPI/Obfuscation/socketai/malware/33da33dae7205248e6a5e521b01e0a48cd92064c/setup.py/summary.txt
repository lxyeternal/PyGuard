  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, executing encrypted payloads during installation on Windows systems, with obfuscation and dynamic code execution indicating a high security threat. The package should be considered dangerous and avoided. The report's lack of detailed analysis is a concern, but the code itself warrants a maximum malware score."
