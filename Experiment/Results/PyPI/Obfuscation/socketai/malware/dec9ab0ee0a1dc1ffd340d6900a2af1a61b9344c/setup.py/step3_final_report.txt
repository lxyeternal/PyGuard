{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package with a custom install class that, on Windows, decrypts and executes a hardcoded payload during installation, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The encrypted payload string, the hardcoded Fernet key, and the OS check trigger the decryption and execution process.",
  "sinks": "The exec() function executes the decrypted code, which can lead to arbitrary code execution or system compromise.",
  "flows": "On Windows, the code imports modules, decrypts the payload with a hardcoded key, and executes it via exec(), constituting a source-to-sink flow of untrusted code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of encrypted payloads, hardcoded cryptographic keys, obfuscated variable names, and conditional execution based on OS are suspicious behaviors indicating obfuscation and malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a custom install class that, during Windows installation, imports cryptography modules, decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload with a static key, and executes it dynamically. The obfuscated variable names and embedded encrypted data suggest an attempt to conceal malicious activity. The use of exec() on decrypted data during package installation is a classic indicator of supply chain malware, potentially allowing remote code execution or backdoor installation. The high malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores assigned in the reports are justified by these behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates malicious behavior by decrypting and executing code during installation on Windows, with obfuscation tactics to hide its intent. It poses a high security risk and should be considered malicious, warranting avoidance and further analysis of the decrypted payload.",
