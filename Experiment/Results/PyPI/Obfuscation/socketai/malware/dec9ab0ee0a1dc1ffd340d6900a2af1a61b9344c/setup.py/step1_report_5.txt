{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup script with custom installation behavior that decrypts and executes remote code on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables, checks OS type, and decrypts a hardcoded encrypted string which contains code to be executed.",
  "sinks": "exec() is used on decrypted code, which can execute arbitrary code. The code fetches and executes remote payloads if on Windows.",
  "flows": "On Windows, os.name check triggers import of requests and Fernet, then decrypts a string and executes it via exec(), potentially executing remote or malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of encrypted string, use of exec() on decrypted data, and code that decrypts and runs code at runtime. The code conditionally executes code only on Windows. The obfuscated variable names and encrypted payload are suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script modifies the setup process by extending the install command. When run on Windows, it imports requests and Fernet, then decrypts an encrypted string and executes it dynamically. The use of encrypted payloads and exec() suggests an attempt to hide malicious behavior. The decryption key and encrypted data are hardcoded, indicating malicious intent or backdoor functionality. The script only activates on Windows, which could be an evasion tactic. The rest of the setup uses standard functions but the core behavior is suspicious due to runtime code execution of decrypted data.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains likely malicious code that decrypts and executes remote or hidden payloads during installation on Windows systems. The presence of encrypted code and dynamic execution, combined with the conditional activation, indicates high malicious potential. The package should be considered unsafe for use.",
