  "confidence": 0.85,
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with low malicious potential; however, reports indicating dynamic execution, obfuscation, and suspicious network activity warrant cautious scoring. Adjustments to report 5's scores improve risk representation. The overall evaluation suggests minimal malicious activity but highlights areas needing further review, especially for report 5."
