  "purpose": "The code appears to initialize a web server and handle HTTP requests, possibly for serving data or API responses.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include incoming HTTP requests and environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network responses, file system writes, and subprocess executions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from HTTP request handlers to response functions and possibly to system calls or external services.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are immediately visible. No obfuscated code or suspicious imports detected. The code uses standard library functions and common web frameworks.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a Flask web server, defining route handlers for various endpoints. It processes request data and responds accordingly. No unusual or malicious constructs such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration routines are detected. The code does not invoke unsafe system commands, nor does it handle sensitive data insecurely. All code appears to follow standard patterns for web applications.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a typical web server application without evident malicious behavior. It does not exhibit signs of malware, supply chain sabotage, or security risks beyond normal web server considerations.",
