  "conclusion": "The dependency code is largely benign, with a minor concern regarding dynamic execution functions in Report 1. Scores are appropriate given the evidence; further review of the actual code, especially for eval()/exec(), is recommended to confirm or refute suspicion. Overall, the security risk is low, and no active malicious behavior is detected."
