      "confidence": 0.95,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation, dynamic external code fetching, and execution, which are classic indicators of malicious behavior. It should be classified as malicious with a malware score close to 0.9. The obfuscation score is also high (~0.9), and the overall security risk is similarly high (~0.9). The code should be treated as malicious and avoided in any environment where security is a concern."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The dependency code is largely benign, with a minor concern regarding dynamic execution functions in Report 1. Scores are appropriate given the evidence; further review of the actual code, especially for eval()/exec(), is recommended to confirm or refute suspicion. Overall, the security risk is low, and no active malicious behavior is detected."

      "confidence": 0.85,
      "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with low malicious potential; however, reports indicating dynamic execution, obfuscation, and suspicious network activity warrant cautious scoring. Adjustments to report 5's scores improve risk representation. The overall evaluation suggests minimal malicious activity but highlights areas needing further review, especially for report 5."

      "obfuscated": 0.2,
      "confidence": 0.85,
      "conclusion": "Most reports correctly identify the absence of code or benign patterns, assigning low risk and malware scores. Report 4 shows some suspicious patterns, warranting a modest increase in malware (to 0.3) and obfuscation (to 0.2) scores, with a risk score of 0.4. The scores are justified and aligned with the observations. No significant changes are necessary, but a slight adjustment for report 4 improves accuracy."
