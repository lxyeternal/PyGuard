  "conclusion": "Most reports correctly identify the absence of code or benign patterns, assigning low risk and malware scores. Report 4 shows some suspicious patterns, warranting a modest increase in malware (to 0.3) and obfuscation (to 0.2) scores, with a risk score of 0.4. The scores are justified and aligned with the observations. No significant changes are necessary, but a slight adjustment for report 4 improves accuracy."
