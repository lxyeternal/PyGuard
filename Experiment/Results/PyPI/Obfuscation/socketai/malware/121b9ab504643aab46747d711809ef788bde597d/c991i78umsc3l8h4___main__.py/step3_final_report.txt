  "purpose": "Assess supply chain security risks and malicious behavior in the provided Python code snippets or reports.",
  "sources": "Input data, code snippets, or descriptions where code reads input or data.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network transmissions, or execution points where untrusted data could cause harm.",
  "flows": "Paths from data sources to sinks, indicating how untrusted data propagates through the code.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious patterns such as dynamic code execution, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual control flows.",
  "analysis": "The code or reports primarily lack actual code snippets, making direct analysis limited. In reports with code, suspicious patterns like dynamic execution, obfuscation, or complex control flows are noted but not confirmed malicious. Absence of code leads to low risk and malware scores. Suspicious patterns, especially in report 4, justify slightly elevated scores. Overall, the assessments are consistent with the evidence, with minor adjustments recommended for report 4 to better reflect suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "Most reports correctly identify the absence of code or benign patterns, assigning low risk and malware scores. Report 4 shows some suspicious patterns, warranting a modest increase in malware (to 0.3) and obfuscation (to 0.2) scores, with a risk score of 0.4. The scores are justified and aligned with the observations. No significant changes are necessary, but a slight adjustment for report 4 improves accuracy.",
