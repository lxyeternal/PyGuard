      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and likely malicious. It employs extensive obfuscation, dynamic code execution, privilege escalation, and system modifications. Given these behaviors, it should be classified with a malware score of 0.9 and a security risk score of 0.9. The obfuscation level is very high, with a score of approximately 0.95. Overall, the package exhibits malicious traits and should be treated as dangerous."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with low security risk; however, Report 1's use of eval/exec and hardcoded URLs suggests potential malicious behavior, warranting an increased malware score if confirmed. Overall, the supply chain security posture is low to moderate, with the main concern being Report 1."
