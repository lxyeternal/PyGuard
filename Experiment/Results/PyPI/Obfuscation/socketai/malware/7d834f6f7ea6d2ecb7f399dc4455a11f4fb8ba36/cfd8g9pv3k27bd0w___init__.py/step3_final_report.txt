  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code patterns, suspicious constructs, and potential vulnerabilities.",
  "sources": "Input from user input, environment variables, network requests, configuration files.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file operations, system commands, data transmission.",
  "flows": "Data from sources to sinks through code execution paths, including eval/exec, network calls, and file writes.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded URLs/credentials, eval/exec usage, obfuscation, suspicious commands, untrusted data flows.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits patterns such as eval/exec with untrusted data and hardcoded secrets in Report 1, indicating potential malicious intent. Other reports show benign, standard code with no suspicious patterns. The suspicion in Report 1 warrants a higher malware score if eval/exec are confirmed. The overall analysis suggests low to moderate risk, with the primary concern centered on Report 1's patterns.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with low security risk; however, Report 1's use of eval/exec and hardcoded URLs suggests potential malicious behavior, warranting an increased malware score if confirmed. Overall, the supply chain security posture is low to moderate, with the main concern being Report 1.",
