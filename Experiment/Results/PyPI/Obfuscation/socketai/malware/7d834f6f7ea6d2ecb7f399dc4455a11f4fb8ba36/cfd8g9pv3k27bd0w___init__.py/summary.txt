  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with low security risk; however, Report 1's use of eval/exec and hardcoded URLs suggests potential malicious behavior, warranting an increased malware score if confirmed. Overall, the supply chain security posture is low to moderate, with the main concern being Report 1."
