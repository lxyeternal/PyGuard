{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information (login, hostname, platform details, current directory, external IP) and exfiltrates it to a remote server during package setup, indicating malicious data theft behavior.",
  "sources": "os.getlogin(), platform.node(), platform.uname(), os.getcwd(), socket connection to 8.8.8.8:53 to determine external IP",
  "sinks": "requests.get() call to send encoded data to external IP address",
  "flows": "Source functions (system info collection, socket for IP) -> encoding in base64 -> HTTP GET request to external server",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, data exfiltration during package setup, transmission to suspicious IP without user consent, lack of validation or error handling",
  "analysis": "The code gathers sensitive system info and encodes it, then transmits it covertly to an external IP during package installation, which is suspicious and indicative of malicious activity. Obfuscation of variable names further suggests malicious intent. The external communication and data collection are not justified in a legitimate package context. The code does not perform destructive actions but performs covert data theft, which is malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious intent through covert data exfiltration, obfuscation, and external communication. It should be considered malicious, warranting high malware and security risk scores.",
