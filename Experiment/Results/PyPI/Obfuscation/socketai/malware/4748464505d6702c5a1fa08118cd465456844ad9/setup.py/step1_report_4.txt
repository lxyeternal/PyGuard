{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configurations for a Python package and includes functions that collect environment variables and send them via HTTP request.",
  "sources": "Environment variables accessed via os.environ, URL encoding of these variables, and a network request to an external URL (https://2edb-85-48-187-158.ngrok-free.app).",
  "sinks": "The urllib request to the specified ngrok URL, which transmits environment data.",
  "flows": "Environment variables → URL encoding → HTTP request to external server.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated function and class names, unconventional code structure, and an explicit call to the function outside setup. The function collects environment variables and sends them to an external server without any clear legitimate purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup tools, defines functions and classes with obfuscated names, and uses environment variables. The core function gathers all environment variables, encodes them, and sends them via an HTTP request to an external URL. The network call is executed at the end of the script, outside of any main guard, which means it runs on import. The obfuscated naming and the action of transmitting environment data to an external server without clear user consent or purpose suggest malicious intent, potentially for data exfiltration or reconnaissance. There are no signs of malicious code such as backdoors, data theft, or remote control features beyond data exfiltration. However, the behavior of sending environment data to an external URL without user knowledge is suspicious and potentially malicious, especially given the obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to collect environment variables and send them to an external server, which is suspicious behavior indicative of data exfiltration. The obfuscated structure and the external URL suggest malicious intent or at least malicious potential. The code should be flagged for security review before use.",
