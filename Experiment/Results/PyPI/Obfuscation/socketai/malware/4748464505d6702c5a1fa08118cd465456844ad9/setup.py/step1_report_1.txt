{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be setting up a Python package installation process with custom behaviors during install and develop commands, and includes a function that sends environment variables to a remote server.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables via os.environ, specifically in the function KZtHUoOYKVwBsPiQywYJmEmdzpucYHWI().",
  "sinks": "The function constructs an HTTP request to a remote server ('https://2edb-85-48-187-158.ngrok-free.app') and sends environment data, which can lead to data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are encoded and sent via an HTTP request within KZtHUoOYKVwBsPiQywYJmEmdzpucYHWI(), which is invoked during package install or development commands.",
  "anomalies": "The function constructs and sends environment data to an external server without any validation, which is unusual for a standard setup script. The use of obfuscated function and variable names, as well as the remote URL, are suspicious. The class definitions override setup commands to execute this data exfiltration during installation processes.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup tools but defines a function that collects environment variables and sends them to an external URL. The function KZtHUoOYKVwBsPiQywYJmEmdzpucYHWI() encodes environment data and makes an HTTP request to a remote server, which is potentially malicious data exfiltration behavior. The function is invoked at the end of the script, ensuring it runs during module execution. Custom install and develop classes override methods to call this function during package installation or development setup, which could be used to stealthily gather system info. The overall code structure, with obfuscated names and remote URL, suggests malicious intent or at least suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The script is designed to send environment variables to a remote server during package installation or development, which could be used for malicious purposes such as data exfiltration. The obfuscated code and remote URL are suspicious and indicate potential malicious intent. It does not contain malware per se but performs suspicious data transmission during setup.",
