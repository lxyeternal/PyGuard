{
  "purpose": "This code sets up a Python package using setuptools and extends the install and develop commands to include a custom function that exfiltrates environment variables to an external server.",
  "sources": "The function KZtHUoOYKVwBsPiQywYJmEmdzpucYHWI reads environment variables; it is invoked during package install or development commands.",
  "sinks": "The environment variables are URL-encoded and sent via an HTTP request to an external ngrok URL, potentially leaking sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Environment variables → URL encoding → HTTP request to external server during package installation or development setup.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function and class names, use of environment variables and HTTP request during setup, which are unusual behaviors for standard package setup scripts. The URL used (ngrok) suggests potential data exfiltration. No other suspicious code patterns or hardcoded credentials are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools and defines functions and classes that override standard install and develop commands to include a function that collects environment variables and sends them to a remote server via an HTTP request. The URL is an ngrok endpoint, which is commonly used for tunneling and potentially malicious data exfiltration. The environment variables are collected and URL-encoded, then sent over HTTP during package installation or development commands. The obfuscated naming of functions and classes indicates an attempt to hide malicious intent. No other malicious code, such as backdoors, system modifications, or data theft beyond environment variables, is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes a likely malicious backdoor that exfiltrates environment variables to an external server during package setup, indicating malicious intent. The obfuscated naming and behavior suggest malicious behavior rather than benign package setup code.",
