{
  "purpose": "The code collects environment variables and exfiltrates them to a remote server during package setup, indicating malicious data theft behavior.",
  "sources": "The environment variables accessed via os.environ, which are then encoded and sent over HTTP.",
  "sinks": "The remote URL (https://2edb-85-48-187-158.ngrok-free.app) where the encoded environment data is transmitted.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read, URL-encoded, and sent via an HTTP request to the external server during setup commands execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated function and class names, execution during setup, and transmission of environment data to an external URL, which is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a function that exfiltrates all environment variables to a remote server. This function is invoked during package installation and development commands, which is unusual and suspicious. The code uses obfuscated names, and the URL is an ngrok endpoint, often associated with malicious activity. The code does not perform any other malicious actions but the exfiltration of potentially sensitive environment data during setup constitutes malicious behavior. The syntax contains errors in the request construction, but the intent is clear. The behavior aligns with malicious supply chain activity, and the obfuscation further indicates malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code actively exfiltrates environment variables during package setup, which is malicious behavior. The obfuscation and remote URL suggest an attempt to conceal malicious activity. The overall security risk is high, and the malware score should reflect this malicious exfiltration behavior.",
