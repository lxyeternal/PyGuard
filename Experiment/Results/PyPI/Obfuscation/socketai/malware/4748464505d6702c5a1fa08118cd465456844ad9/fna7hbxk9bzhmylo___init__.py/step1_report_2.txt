  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a simple script for data processing or utility functions, with no clear indication of malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Reads data from environment variables, standard input, and local files.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to console, logs, or writes to files. Also makes network requests (if any are present).",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (input, environment) through processing functions and potentially to sinks (output, network).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or unusual code structures detected. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes variables from environment or user input, processes data with functions, and outputs results. No suspicious or malicious patterns, such as sending data over network or executing system commands. Usage of standard libraries and straightforward logic reduces suspicion. Absence of hardcoded secrets or code injection points. Overall, the code demonstrates typical utility functionality without malicious features.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the analysis, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign utility script with no evident supply chain or malware concerns.",
