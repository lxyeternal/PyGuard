  "purpose": "Evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Environment variable reads, import statements, data reading functions, potential dynamic code execution points, configuration variables.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, data exfiltration points, environment variables, file system modifications, dynamic eval or exec calls.",
  "flows": "Data from environment variables or inputs to potential sinks like network or file system, possibly via eval or exec.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code makes detection of anomalies impossible; mentions of dynamic eval, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are speculative without actual code.",
  "analysis": "All reports lack concrete code snippets, relying on high-level descriptions. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.2) are consistent with the absence of evidence. Confidence levels vary based on the amount of information, generally low due to missing code. No suspicious patterns or anomalies are identified, and the cautious risk score reflects potential concerns without concrete proof.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided summaries, there is no evidence of malicious or obfuscated code. The low risk score is appropriate given the lack of actual code snippets. The assessments are consistent and justified; no adjustments are necessary unless further code is provided.",
