{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this code is not explicitly clear; it appears to be an import and initialization script, possibly for a larger application.",
  "sources": "Imports external modules and reads environment variables (if any) for configuration.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file operations, or subprocess calls (not visible in the snippet).",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources such as environment variables or user input to processing functions, and then potentially to external systems or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies; the code provided is minimal and standard. Lack of detailed operations makes it difficult to detect malicious intent directly.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only import statements and possibly variable initializations. No explicit data processing, network activity, or system modifications are present. Without additional context or further code, no malicious behavior can be identified. The minimal structure suggests standard setup code, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign and typical for a setup or import module, with no suspicious patterns or anomalies.",
