{
  "purpose": "The code implements a heavily obfuscated HTTP client library, managing URL parsing, request preparation, headers, cookies, and response decoding.",
  "sources": "URL input, headers, request bodies, and response streams.",
  "sinks": "URL validation, request assembly, response content, and headers.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into URL parsing, request setup, and response processing, with potential for misuse if inputs are malicious.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation in import names, variable names, and class/method structures; complex dynamic handling; minimal validation; no hardcoded secrets or malicious network activity evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a complex, heavily obfuscated HTTP client with functions for URL validation, request construction, cookie management, and response decoding. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command execution, or sabotage are present. The heavy obfuscation increases difficulty in analysis but does not inherently indicate malicious intent. The code handles untrusted inputs but lacks rigorous validation, which could be exploited. The overall structure aligns with legitimate HTTP client libraries, and no malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, albeit heavily obfuscated, HTTP request/response handling library with no active malicious activity. The high obfuscation score reflects the code's obscured nature, but the malware score remains at 0 due to lack of evidence of malicious behavior. The security risk is moderate (0.3), primarily due to obfuscation and minimal validation, which warrants cautious review but does not indicate active threats.",
