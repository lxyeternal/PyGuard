  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, albeit heavily obfuscated, HTTP request/response handling library with no active malicious activity. The high obfuscation score reflects the code's obscured nature, but the malware score remains at 0 due to lack of evidence of malicious behavior. The security risk is moderate (0.3), primarily due to obfuscation and minimal validation, which warrants cautious review but does not indicate active threats."
