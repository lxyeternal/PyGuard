  "purpose": "Documentation and usage examples for the Python requests library, demonstrating GET and POST requests.",
  "sources": "Code snippets illustrating requests.get() and requests.post() usage, including payload definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data flows indicating potential data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., URL, payload) flows into requests methods; no suspicious data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of nonsensical, obfuscated strings such as 'rHChMIEEszFFPjoQwvOvVHUaXVppTmXQ', 'requests.mlEkwRtdXCHzDsPABGnsTDiyGPubNzXG', 'r.UXMkOjDNPCKllyuZmBeprviJvAGdThfJ', and 'sruTOzKyOkXMTxFizktPGlNStGhAVmjH' which do not correspond to valid code or known malicious patterns. These appear to be formatting errors, obfuscation artifacts, or corruption.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets are standard documentation with embedded nonsensical strings that do not execute or perform any malicious activity. The anomalies are consistent across reports and are likely due to formatting or obfuscation artifacts rather than malicious intent. No evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, or harmful behavior is present. The obfuscated strings do not match typical malicious obfuscation patterns and are more indicative of data corruption or formatting issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as documentation with formatting anomalies that are unlikely to be malicious. The anomalies are artifacts rather than indicators of malicious activity. The overall security risk is minimal, and no malware is present.",
