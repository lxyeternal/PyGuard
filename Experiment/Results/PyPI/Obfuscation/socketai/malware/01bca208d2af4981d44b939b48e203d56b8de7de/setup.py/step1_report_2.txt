  "purpose": "This script appears to be a setup configuration script for a Python package, handling dependencies, package metadata, and custom installation commands.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (TMPDIR, TEMP, TMP, USERPROFILE), files (__version__.py, README.md), subprocess calls, and imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls executing external commands, dynamic code execution via exec, importing and cloning from external Git repositories, and potentially unsafe subprocess commands.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and files provide data to control flow; subprocess calls and dynamic code execution (exec and base64 decode) execute code fetched or generated at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names (e.g., vWUKxvbBMhWwYfNsrUqZSRKnkqvrEAmB, imfupctvwGWkGzlWxOkYCWOCTFdAFCuG), complex and unusual logic for temporary directory determination, cloning a Git repository, and executing code based on repository data. The code in 'clone' output is base64-decoded and executed, which is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup script with normal package setup, but it includes suspicious behaviors such as: \n- Obfuscated and unusual variable names, indicating possible hiding of malicious intent.\n- Fetching code from an external Git repository ('https://github.com/isaaknikolaev/PySocks.git') and executing it after decoding base64 data from the repository's latest commit message.\n- Conditional cloning and executing code on Windows, including calling pip to install 'dulwich' for cloning.\n- Dynamic execution with exec and base64 decoding suggests potential remote code execution or payload delivery.\n- No explicit hardcoded credentials, but the obfuscation and dynamic code execution are strong indicators of malicious or sabotage intent.\n- The package setup process itself appears normal, but the embedded code and cloning behavior are highly suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated variables and malicious-like behavior, including remote code retrieval and execution, which is indicative of potential malware or sabotage. The main concern is the code fetching and executing data from an external repository dynamically, which could allow remote control or malicious payload delivery.\nOverall, the package exhibits likely malicious intent with a high security risk. The malicious code and obfuscation elevate the threat level, making this package unsafe to use.",
