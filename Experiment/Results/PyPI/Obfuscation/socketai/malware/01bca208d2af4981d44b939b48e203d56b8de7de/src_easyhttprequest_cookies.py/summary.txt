  "conclusion": "The code functions as a compatibility utility for cookie management within requests, with no explicit malicious activity detected. The primary concern is the heavy obfuscation, which warrants caution but does not confirm malicious intent. The low malware score (0.1) reflects the absence of evidence for malicious behavior, while the high obfuscation score (0.75) indicates suspicion due to code concealment. The overall security risk remains moderate (0.3), primarily due to obfuscation potential."
