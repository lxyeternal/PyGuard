      "conclusion": "The code exhibits multiple indicators of malicious activity, including remote code cloning, base64 decoding and execution, and obfuscation. The security and malware scores are justified at high levels due to the significant risk of remote payload execution and sabotage. It should be considered highly suspicious and unsafe for production use."

      "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated with no direct evidence of malicious activity. The obfuscation pattern suggests potential concealment, warranting caution. The overall security risk is moderate, and the malware likelihood is low but not negligible due to obfuscation. Further analysis of the broader codebase and execution context is recommended."

The high obfuscation score reflects the code's obscured nature, but the malware score remains at 0 due to lack of evidence of malicious behavior. The security risk is moderate (0.3), primarily due to obfuscation and minimal validation, which warrants cautious review but does not indicate active threats."

      "conclusion": "The code functions as a compatibility utility for cookie management within requests, with no explicit malicious activity detected. The primary concern is the heavy obfuscation, which warrants caution but does not confirm malicious intent. The low malware score (0.1) reflects the absence of evidence for malicious behavior, while the high obfuscation score (0.75) indicates suspicion due to code concealment. The overall security risk remains moderate (0.3), primarily due to obfuscation potential."
