  "purpose": "The code appears to be a Python module intended for general functionality, but its exact purpose cannot be determined without examining specific logic or documentation.",
  "sources": "Input or data sources are not explicitly evident; no input functions or data reads are visible in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system modifications are present in the code segment.",
  "flows": "There are no identifiable source-to-sink data flows; the code lacks untrusted data handling or transmission pathways.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious URL calls, or obfuscated code patterns are observed; the code appears straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code does not contain any obvious malicious patterns, such as dynamic code execution, network communication, or data exfiltration. Usage of third-party libraries is present but not inherently suspicious. There are no signs of hardcoded credentials or backdoors. The overall structure is typical for a Python module, and no unusual behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign with no obvious supply chain or malware-related issues.",
