  "purpose": "Assess the security posture of the Python dependency based on provided code snippets and reports, focusing on malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Input data from code files, environment variables, and potential data flows to network or file sinks.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file operations, environment variables, dynamic code execution points such as eval or exec.",
  "flows": "Data originating from inputs or environment variables flowing into sinks like network sockets, file writes, or eval/exec calls.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code; code appears straightforward and benign.",
  "analysis": "All reports consistently indicate no malicious indicators, no obfuscation, and minimal security risks. Malware scores are zero, obfuscated scores are zero, and risk scores are low (0.1-0.2). Confidence levels are high where code is analyzed. The reasoning aligns with the descriptions, and no suspicious behaviors or vulnerabilities are identified. Slightly conservative risk scores reflect cautious assessment but are justified given the lack of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency appears benign with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. Security risks are minimal, and the code structure is straightforward. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No further action or revision is necessary.",
