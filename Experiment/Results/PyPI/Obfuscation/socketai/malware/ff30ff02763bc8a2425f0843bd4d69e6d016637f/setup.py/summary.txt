  "conclusion": "This code exhibits active malicious behavior, including persistent browser hijacking, obfuscated data interception payloads, and system modifications for covert control. The high level of obfuscation, combined with system and browser manipulations, confirms malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are justified; I would assign a malware score of 0.85, an obfuscated score of 0.8, and a security risk score of 0.9 to reflect the severity of the threat."
