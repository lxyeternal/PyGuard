  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, user input, network responses, files, command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, files, subprocess calls, environment variables, system commands, stdout.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input flows into network communication, subprocess execution, or environment variable usage without validation.",
  "anomalies": "Potential eval/exec usage, hardcoded URLs or credentials, obfuscation, data exfiltration mechanisms, dynamic code execution indicators.",
  "analysis": "The code shows typical patterns of data processing and network interaction. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected in most reports, but suspicious features like eval/exec, obfuscated code, or hardcoded URLs are flagged in report 5. The risk is moderate, with some reports indicating potential misuse but no confirmed malicious activity. Scores are generally aligned with the described behaviors, with the highest suspicion in report 5. Slight adjustments to malware and risk scores could be justified if explicit malicious indicators are confirmed, but current assessments are consistent with the provided summaries.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with moderate security concerns primarily related to unvalidated inputs and network interactions. Report 5 exhibits suspicious patterns warranting a higher malware suspicion (~0.6) and overall risk (~0.65). The scores are appropriate and reflect the analysis, with minor potential for adjustment if further code details confirm malicious activity.",
