  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious intent due to the execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command during package setup. The pattern of hidden, encoded execution and error suppression suggests malicious behavior, warranting caution and further decoding of the payload. The high scores in the reports are justified by these indicators."
