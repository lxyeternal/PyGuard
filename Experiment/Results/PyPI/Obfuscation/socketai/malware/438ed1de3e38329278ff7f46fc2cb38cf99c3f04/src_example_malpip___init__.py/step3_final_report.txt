{
  "purpose": "To evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and data flow anomalies, ensuring accurate malware and risk scoring based on code analysis.",
  "sources": "Input data includes code snippets, environment variables, network communication points, and data handling functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network transmission functions, environment variable access, file operations, and data output points where untrusted data could cause leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as input functions or environment variables through processing functions to sinks like network calls or file writes, indicating potential attack vectors if untrusted data is mishandled.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code constructs detected; code appears standard and benign.",
  "analysis": "The provided reports indicate the absence of code or malicious indicators, with high confidence in benignity where code is analyzed. Scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 or 0) are consistent with the evidence. High confidence scores in some reports are justified by detailed reasoning; where no code exists, confidence and risk are appropriately low. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are identified, and the code structure appears standard.",
  "conclusion": "All reports accurately reflect the lack of malicious activity and obfuscation, with scores aligned to their reasoning. No adjustments are necessary; the overall security posture based on available data is benign.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
