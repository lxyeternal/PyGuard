{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup script with malicious intent embedded in custom install behavior, likely to establish a reverse shell connection to a remote server.",
  "sources": "The socket connection setup in the function YVdYMdxwKDKuQDILgqFJIPBDwtQlRJun, which connects to an external IP and port.",
  "sinks": "The socket connection allows data transmission to the remote server, potentially enabling remote command execution or data exfiltration. The os.dup2 calls redirect standard input/output to the socket, facilitating remote shell access.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom 'install' command triggers YVdYMdxwKDKuQDILgqFJIPBDwtQlRJun, which opens a socket, duplicates file descriptors, and spawns a shell, creating a reverse shell flow to the attacker-controlled server.",
  "anomalies": "The presence of obfuscated variable names, a function that establishes a reverse shell connection, and the malicious code triggered during the install process indicate malicious intent. The setup script includes misleading package info with a fake project description.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with imports, including potentially useful modules for network and system manipulation. The function YVdYMdxwKDKuQDILgqFJIPBDwtQlRJun creates a socket to a specific external IP and port, then redirects standard streams to this socket and spawns a shell, enabling remote control. The setup configuration is standard, but the overridden install class triggers the reverse shell upon installation. The code's obfuscation via nonsensical variable names and embedded malicious function indicates intentional sabotage. No other suspicious behaviors, such as data exfiltration or persistence mechanisms, are evident beyond the reverse shell. Overall, the package is designed for malicious remote access upon installation.",
  "conclusion": "This Python package contains embedded malicious code that establishes a reverse shell during installation, representing a severe security risk. The code is intentionally obfuscated, and the malicious behavior is triggered automatically, indicating a high likelihood of sabotage. The package should be considered unsafe for use.",
