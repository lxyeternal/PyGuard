{
  "purpose": "This code defines a malicious Python package that includes backdoor functionality to establish a reverse shell connection to an external server, and it disguises this behavior within a setup script for a Python package.",
  "sources": [
    "The function YVdYMdxwKDKuQDILgqFJIPBDwtQlRJun() which establishes a socket connection to an external IP and port.",
    "Import of the socket, os, and pty modules and usage to spawn a shell over a reverse connection."
  ],
  "sinks": [
    "The socket connection to the hardcoded IP address and port (194.233.164.169:1337).",
    "The spawning of a shell via pty.spawn('sh') after connecting to the server, enabling remote command execution."
  ],
  "flows": [
    "During package installation or development, the custom install/develop commands invoke YVdYMdxwKDKuQDILgqFJIPBDwtQlRJun(), establishing a reverse shell to the hardcoded IP and port.",
    "Data flows from the attacker-controlled server through the socket connection, potentially allowing remote command execution on the victim system."
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "Obfuscated and nonsensical class and function names, designed to hide malicious intent.",
    "Inclusion of code that initiates a reverse shell connection during package installation or development commands.",
    "Presence of hardcoded external IP address and port, which is typical of command-and-control (C2) servers."
  ],
  "analysis": "The code imports modules commonly used for system control and network communication. It defines a function that creates a socket connection to a specific IP and port, then redirects standard input, output, and error streams to this connection, effectively providing remote shell access. This function is invoked during the installation process via a custom install class. The package metadata describes itself as malicious, indicating malicious intent. The obfuscation of class and function names further suggests an attempt to conceal the malicious behavior. Overall, the code is designed to establish a covert backdoor on the host system, allowing remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains malicious code that creates a reverse shell connection to an external server during installation, indicating high malicious intent and security risk. The code is intentionally obfuscated, and the behavior is clearly malicious. It should be considered dangerous and should not be used.",
