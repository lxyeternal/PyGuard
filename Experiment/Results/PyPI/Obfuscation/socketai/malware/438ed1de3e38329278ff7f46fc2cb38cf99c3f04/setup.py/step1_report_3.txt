{
  "purpose": "The code defines a malicious Python package intended to establish a reverse shell connection to a remote server when installed or developed, potentially for unauthorized remote access or control.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded IP address and port, socket connection establishment, and spawn shell command.",
  "sinks": "Socket connection to remote server, spawn shell process, socket duplication for stdin/stdout/stderr, network communication to the specified IP and port.",
  "flows": "During package installation or development, the custom install/develop commands invoke the reverse shell function, which connects to a remote IP and port, redirects system streams, and spawns an interactive shell.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and function names, use of socket for reverse shell, immediate connection to hardcoded IP and port during installation, and spawning a shell without user consent. The setup script contains code that is not typical for standard package distribution.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules for networking, process control, and file operations. It defines a hardcoded IP address and port, then creates a socket connection to that address. Upon connection, it duplicates socket file descriptors to stdin, stdout, and stderr, then spawns a shell (sh). This behavior is embedded in custom setup command classes that override 'develop' and 'install', causing the reverse shell to activate during package installation or development setup. The package metadata includes misleading or generic descriptions but the core malicious behavior is embedded in the custom command classes, which execute the reverse shell. The use of obfuscated class and function names is suspicious and indicates an attempt to hide malicious intent. Overall, this code is designed to establish a backdoor connection upon package install, representing a high security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains clear malicious behavior intended to create a reverse shell backdoor during package setup. It is obfuscated and embeds a hardcoded IP and port for remote access, making it highly dangerous. This package should be considered malicious and unsafe to use.",
