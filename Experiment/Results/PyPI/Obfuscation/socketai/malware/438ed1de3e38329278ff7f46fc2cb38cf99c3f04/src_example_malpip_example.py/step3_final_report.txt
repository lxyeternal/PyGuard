  "purpose": "A simple function that increments a number by 1.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'number' received by the function.",
  "sinks": "Return statement output; no external data or untrusted sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Input 'number' flows directly to the return statement after incrementing.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function name; no malicious code, external dependencies, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward arithmetic function with an obfuscated name. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, noting the obfuscation but no malicious activity. Malware scores are zero, and security risk scores are very low (~0.1), consistent with the benign and simple operation. The obfuscation score varies moderately, reflecting suspicion due to name obscurity but not malicious intent. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, performing a basic increment operation. Obfuscation is present but does not imply malicious intent. Scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis; no further action needed.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
