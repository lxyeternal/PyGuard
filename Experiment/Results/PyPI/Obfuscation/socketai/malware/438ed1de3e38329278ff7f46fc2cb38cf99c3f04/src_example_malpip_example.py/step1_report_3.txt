  "purpose": "A simple function that increments a given number by 1.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'number' as a numeric value.",
  "sinks": "Return statement outputs the incremented number.",
  "flows": "Input 'number' flows directly to the return statement as 'number + 1'.",
  "anomalies": "Code is very minimal, with no hardcoded credentials, no external network calls, and no obfuscation. No suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The function 'cbIIJLnhTkoYMWHYlUJDbbdbnryMZHJr' takes an input 'number' and returns 'number + 1'. The code is straightforward, with no external dependencies, no data leakage, no hidden code, and no malicious behavior. It appears to be a simple increment function. The function name is obscure, but that alone does not indicate malicious intent; it may be obfuscated or autogenerated. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a basic, harmless function performing a simple arithmetic operation with no malicious intent or security risks.",
