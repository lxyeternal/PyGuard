  "purpose": "A simple function that increments a number by 1",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'number'",
  "sinks": "Return statement, outputting the incremented number",
  "flows": "Input 'number' flows directly to the return statement with a simple addition",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and contains no suspicious or unusual features",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function with an obfuscated name that takes a single parameter and returns that parameter incremented by one. There are no external data reads, no use of environment variables, no network operations, or other typical indicators of malicious behavior. The function appears to perform a benign, simple arithmetic operation without side effects or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign function with obfuscated naming but no malicious intent or suspicious activity. It poses no security risk.",
