  "purpose": "Simple function to increment a number by 1",

  "flows": "Input 'number' flows directly to the return statement after incrementing",
  "anomalies": "Function name appears obfuscated; no other suspicious behavior or code structure present",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function with an obfuscated name that takes a single input and returns that input incremented by 1. There are no external data sources, no network calls, no file operations, and no hidden behaviors. The function is straightforward and does not contain any malicious code or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign function that increments a number. Its obfuscated name suggests it may be intentionally disguised, but the code itself is not malicious or suspicious.",
