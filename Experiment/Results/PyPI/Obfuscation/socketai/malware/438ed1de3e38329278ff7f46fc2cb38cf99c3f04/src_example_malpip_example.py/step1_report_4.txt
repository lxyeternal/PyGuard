{
  "purpose": "The function appears to increment a given number by 1, likely intended for simple arithmetic operations.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'number' is a source of data.",
  "sinks": "The function returns the incremented number; no external sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input 'number' flows directly to the return statement after incrementation.",
  "anomalies": "The function name is obfuscated and nonsensical, which is suspicious. The code is minimal but contains no external dependencies or complex behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: a single function that takes a number and returns that number plus one. The function name is obfuscated, which may suggest an attempt to hide purpose, but the function itself performs a benign operation. No malicious code, external data access, or malicious behaviors are present. The obfuscated name alone is suspicious but not harmful. Overall, the code is simple and does not demonstrate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a basic arithmetic operation with an obfuscated function name. No malicious behavior is detected, but the obfuscated name warrants caution. Overall security risk is very low.",
