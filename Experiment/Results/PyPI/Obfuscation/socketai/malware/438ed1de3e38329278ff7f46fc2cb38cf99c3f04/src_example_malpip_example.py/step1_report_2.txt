  "purpose": "Simple function to increment a number by 1",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'number'",
  "sinks": "Return statement outputs the incremented value",
  "flows": "Input 'number' is read and directly returned after increment",
  "anomalies": "Function name appears obfuscated; no other suspicious or malicious behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function with a seemingly obfuscated name that takes a single argument 'number' and returns 'number + 1'. There are no external data sources, no side effects, no network activity, or code injection. The obfuscated name may suggest an attempt to hide intent, but the function itself is benign and performs a straightforward arithmetic operation. No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious imports, or other anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign function that increments a number. The obfuscated name alone does not indicate malicious intent, and there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
