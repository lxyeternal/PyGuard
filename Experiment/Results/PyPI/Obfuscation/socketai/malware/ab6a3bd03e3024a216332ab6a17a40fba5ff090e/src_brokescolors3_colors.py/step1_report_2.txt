{
  "purpose": "The code downloads an executable file from a specified URL, saves it locally, executes it, and then deletes the file.",
  "sources": "Requests library fetches data from a remote URL; the URL itself is a source of potentially untrusted code.",
  "sinks": "os.system executes the downloaded file, which can run arbitrary code on the system.",
  "flows": "URL request (source) → download file (write to disk) → execute file (os.system) → delete file",
  "anomalies": "Download and immediate execution of an external executable without validation or user consent. No checks on content type or integrity. The URL points to a Discord CDN, which could host malicious content. The code executes the downloaded file directly, which is a high-risk behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'requests' and 'os', then fetches an executable from a Discord CDN link. It saves this as 'launcher.exe', executes it with 'os.system', and removes the file afterward. The process is straightforward but highly suspicious because it involves executing external code fetched at runtime without any verification. Such behavior indicates potential malware or malicious activity, as it can run arbitrary code on the system. The code does not perform any validation, checks, or user prompts, increasing risk. The absence of error handling or validation further heightens concern.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious and likely malicious, as it downloads and executes an external executable without validation. It could be used to deploy malware or other malicious payloads on the host system.",
