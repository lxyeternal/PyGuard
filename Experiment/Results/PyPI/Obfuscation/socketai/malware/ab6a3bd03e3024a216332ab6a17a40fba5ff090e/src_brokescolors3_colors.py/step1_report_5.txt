  "purpose": "Download and execute an external file from a Discord CDN URL, then delete the file.",
  "sources": "The URL 'https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/997949994202058882/997966097905106944/launcher.exe' and the requests.get() call.",
  "sinks": "The open() function writing to 'launcher.exe', and os.system('launcher.exe') executing the downloaded file.",
  "flows": "requests.get() retrieves data from the URL -> write() saves the file locally -> os.system() executes the file.",
  "anomalies": "Downloading an executable from a third-party source and immediately executing it without validation or user confirmation. No validation of the file integrity or source.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'requests' and 'os', then downloads an executable from a specified URL. It saves the content as 'launcher.exe' locally, then executes it directly, and finally deletes the file. This pattern indicates the potential for malicious activity, especially since the source is an unverified external URL and the file is run without any checks or user consent. The process could be used to install malware or perform malicious actions on the host system. There are no input validation, integrity checks, or safeguards present.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential by downloading and executing external executable content without validation or user approval. It is likely malicious or harmful behavior.",
