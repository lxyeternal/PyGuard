{
  "purpose": "Download and execute an external executable file from a specified URL",
  "sources": "URL request to fetch 'launcher.exe' via requests.get",
  "sinks": "os.system call to execute the downloaded file",
  "flows": "requests.get retrieves content -> file written to disk -> os.system executes the file",
  "anomalies": "Direct download and execution of a binary from a remote URL without validation; no integrity check or authentication; use of os.system for execution, which can be unsafe",
  "analysis": "The code imports requests and os modules, then downloads an executable file from a Discord CDN URL. It writes the binary content to 'launcher.exe' and immediately executes it via os.system. After execution, it deletes the file. The lack of any validation, signature check, or sandboxing raises concerns about malicious intent. The code dynamically retrieves and runs an external binary, which is typical behavior of malware, especially given the context of executing a downloaded executable without verification.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and potentially malicious. It downloads and executes a remote binary without validation or user consent, indicating malicious intent. This pattern resembles typical malware behavior aimed at executing arbitrary code on the host system.",
