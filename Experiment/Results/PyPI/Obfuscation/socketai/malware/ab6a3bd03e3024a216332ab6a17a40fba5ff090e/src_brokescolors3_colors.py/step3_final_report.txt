{
  "purpose": "The code downloads an executable from a remote URL, executes it immediately, and deletes the file, indicating malicious intent to run untrusted code.",
  "sources": "Requests the URL 'https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/997949994202058882/997966097905106944/launcher.exe' and reads its content into memory.",
  "sinks": "The 'os.system('launcher.exe')' call executes the downloaded executable, potentially running malicious code on the system.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the URL request to in-memory content, then to writing 'launcher.exe' on disk, followed by execution via 'os.system()', and finally deletion of the file.",
  "anomalies": "No validation or checksum verification of the downloaded file; immediate execution without user consent; use of 'os.system()' to run untrusted code; no error handling or sandboxing.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward download of an external executable, writes it locally, executes it directly, and then deletes it. It lacks validation, checksums, or user prompts, which are standard security measures. The pattern is characteristic of malware delivery mechanisms. The use of 'os.system()' to run untrusted code is highly risky. The URL is from Discord CDN, which could host malicious payloads. The code is not obfuscated, and the behavior strongly indicates malicious activity. The high confidence scores (0.9) and malware score (1) are justified given the pattern. The security risk score (1) reflects the high danger of executing untrusted external code without validation.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits classic malicious behavior by downloading and executing an untrusted executable without validation, posing a high security risk. The behavior pattern and lack of safeguards justify a malware score of 1 and a security risk score of 1. The code should be treated as malicious and avoided in any environment.",
