  "purpose": "Terminal UI styling, animations, ASCII art, and visual effects.",
  "sources": "Terminal size queries, user input prompts, stdout writes, system commands for terminal control.",
  "sinks": "User input, stdout output, system shell commands (clear, title, mode).",
  "flows": "Input prompts or terminal commands influence display or terminal state; no network or file exfiltration observed.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with nonsensical class and function names, placeholder functions, complex string manipulations, and ASCII art generation.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily for aesthetic terminal utilities—animations, colors, banners, cursor control. Obfuscation is high, likely to conceal complexity or for stylistic purposes. No evidence of malicious payloads, network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The functions are designed for visual effects and user prompts, with no signs of malicious intent. The heavy obfuscation is suspicious but not necessarily malicious, and the system commands are limited to terminal control. User input is used for display, not data collection or exfiltration. Overall, the code appears benign but warrants caution due to obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated collection of terminal UI utilities, animations, and ASCII art functions. No signs of malware, malicious payloads, or network activity are present. The obfuscation likely serves aesthetic or concealment purposes rather than malicious intent. The overall security risk is low, with a malware score of 0.2, obfuscation score of 0.8, and risk score of 0.2.",
