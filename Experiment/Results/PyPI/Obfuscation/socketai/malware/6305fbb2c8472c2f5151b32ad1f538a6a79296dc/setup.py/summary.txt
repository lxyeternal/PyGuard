  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed silently during package setup. The behavior aligns with malicious activity, warranting high malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores. The use of stealth techniques and obfuscation strongly suggests malicious intent, though definitive confirmation requires payload decoding. Overall, the package should be treated as malicious or compromised until further analysis is performed."
