  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up a Python package distribution with specific metadata. Additionally, it attempts to run a hidden PowerShell command if a certain directory does not exist.",
  "sources": "os.path.exists('tahg') check, subprocess.Popen call with encoded PowerShell command",
  "sinks": "subprocess.Popen executes a potentially malicious PowerShell encoded command that may run arbitrary code",
  "flows": "Check for 'tahg' directory -> if not found, execute hidden PowerShell command via subprocess",
  "anomalies": "Use of encoded PowerShell command in subprocess without validation, silent failure with broad except blocks, unusual code structure with minimal comments, obfuscated or encoded command string",
  "analysis": "The script begins by importing setup from distutils.core. It then checks if a directory 'tahg' exists; if not, it attempts to run a PowerShell command encoded in base64 or another encoding, via subprocess.Popen, with the window hidden. The command appears to be obfuscated, likely designed to run silently. The setup function is called with package metadata. The use of broad exception handling suppresses errors, which could hide malicious activity. The PowerShell command, when decoded, suggests execution of remote scripts or commands, indicating potential malicious intent. The script's structure and silent failure pattern are suspicious and could be used to execute malicious payloads without raising suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a potentially malicious PowerShell command executed silently, which poses a security risk. The package setup itself appears legitimate, but the conditional execution of hidden system commands is suspicious and could be used for malicious purposes.",
