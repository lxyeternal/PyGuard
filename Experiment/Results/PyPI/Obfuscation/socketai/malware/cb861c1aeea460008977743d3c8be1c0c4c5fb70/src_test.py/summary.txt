  "conclusion": "The code functions as a malicious reverse shell backdoor, connecting to an attacker-controlled server and providing remote command execution. The silent error handling and persistent connection make it a high-severity security threat. The reports correctly identify these behaviors, and the assigned scores accurately reflect the malicious nature and high risk."
