{
  "purpose": "The code appears to provide simple numerical operations and includes an obfuscated segment that executes dynamically decoded code, potentially for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "The function fPkUBBjeUpaHoaDPfZhBAVUKiQSsEkIR reads a base64-encoded string and executes its decoded content. The base64 string is a source of potentially malicious code.",
  "sinks": "exec() executes the decoded code, which is a sink that can run arbitrary code, making it a high-risk behavior.",
  "flows": "The function fPkUBBjeUpaHoaDPfZhBAVUKiQSsEkIR decodes base64, then executes it, which could lead to arbitrary code execution. The input 'number' is used in a safe manner, but the execution of decoded code is dangerous.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding combined with exec() suggests obfuscation aimed at hiding malicious behavior. The code within the exec() is not transparent and could contain harmful instructions.",
  "analysis": "The code contains two simple functions performing addition and subtraction. The second function includes an obfuscated segment that decodes a base64 string and executes it dynamically, which is a common technique for hiding malicious code. The decoded code imports subprocess and socket modules, creates a socket connection, and executes shell commands, which could be used for malicious remote control, data exfiltration, or other harmful actions. The use of exec() with decoded data is a critical security concern, indicating potential malicious intent. The straightforward addition and subtraction functions seem benign but are overshadowed by the obfuscated execution segment.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated malicious behavior via dynamic code execution with base64 decoding and exec(), which is highly suspicious. The presence of modules related to subprocess and socket communication suggests potential for remote control or data theft. Overall, the package exhibits high malicious risk due to the obfuscated execution component.",
