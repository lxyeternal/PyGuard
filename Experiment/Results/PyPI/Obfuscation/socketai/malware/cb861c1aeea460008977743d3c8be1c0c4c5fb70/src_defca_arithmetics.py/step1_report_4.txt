  "purpose": "Provide simple numerical manipulation functions and execute dynamically decoded code.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'number' in functions, base64-encoded string in exec() call.",
  "sinks": "exec() with dynamically decoded code, potentially executing malicious payload.",
  "flows": "Input 'number' is used in arithmetic operations, but the main concern is the exec() execution of decoded code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding and exec() suggests obfuscated or hidden behavior, especially since the decoded code involves importing subprocess and socket modules, and making network or process operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions: one simple addition, the other decodes a base64 string and executes it. The decoded code imports subprocess and socket modules, and performs operations like process and socket handling. This pattern is typical of malicious code attempting to conceal its behavior. The presence of exec() with a base64-encoded payload is suspicious. The first function is benign but unrelated to the potential threat. The second function's embedded code could be malicious, especially since it uses exec() to run arbitrary code, which is often used to hide malicious payloads. Overall, the code has indicators of obfuscation and potential malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated and potentially malicious behavior via dynamic code execution with base64 decoding. While the first function is harmless, the second function's use of exec() with decoded code suggests malicious intent, possibly to execute hidden malicious payloads.",
