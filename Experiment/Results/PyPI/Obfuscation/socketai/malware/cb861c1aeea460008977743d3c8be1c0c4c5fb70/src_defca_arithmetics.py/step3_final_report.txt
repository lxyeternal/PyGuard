  "purpose": "Detect malicious obfuscated code that executes arbitrary commands via dynamic decoding and execution.",
  "sources": "Base64-encoded string decoded within the function, which is then executed via exec().",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing decoded code; code imports modules like subprocess, socket, and performs network connections.",
  "flows": "Base64 string decoded -> exec() executes code -> code imports modules and connects to localhost:443.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding combined with exec() on obfuscated code; imported modules like subprocess and socket used for network activity; no input validation.",
  "analysis": "The code contains two functions: one benign performing number + 1, and another that decodes a base64 string and executes it. The decoded code imports modules such as subprocess and socket, and establishes socket connections to localhost:443, indicating potential malicious activity. The use of exec() on decoded, obfuscated code is a common technique for hiding malicious payloads. The high level of obfuscation and network activity strongly suggest malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0.8-0.9, obfuscated: 0.8-0.9, security risk: 0.75-0.9) are consistent with this analysis. The high confidence scores are justified given the evidence. The code's behavior aligns with typical malicious payloads designed for remote control or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and likely malicious due to obfuscated execution of code that performs network connections and imports modules commonly used for malicious activities. The high scores assigned are justified and consistent with the observed behavior.",
