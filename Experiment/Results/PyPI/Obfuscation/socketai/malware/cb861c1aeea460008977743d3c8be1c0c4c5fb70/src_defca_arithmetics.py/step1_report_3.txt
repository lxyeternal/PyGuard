{
  "purpose": "The code defines two functions, one for simple arithmetic and another that decodes and executes base64-encoded code, potentially malicious.",
  "sources": [
    "The function fPkUBBjeUpaHoaDPfZhBAVUKiQSsEkIR contains an import statement and an exec call with decoded base64 data, which is a clear data source that can execute arbitrary code."
  ],
  "sinks": [
    "The exec(base64.b64decode(...)) line executes arbitrary code, which is a high-risk sink."
  ],
  "flows": [
    "Input parameter 'number' flows into the second function and is used in arithmetic operations, but the primary concern is the execution of dynamically decoded code."
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "Use of base64 decoding combined with exec for code execution is suspicious and potentially malicious.",
    "The code inside the base64 string is obfuscated and not transparent, indicating possible malicious intent."
  ],
  "analysis": "The first function 'nDiqrKJXAuFMoRAbcUNmDyuBOyfALtJK' performs a benign addition operation. The second function 'fPkUBBjeUpaHoaDPfZhBAVUKiQSsEkIR' imports 'base64', then decodes and executes a hardcoded base64 string. The decoded code imports 'subprocess', 'socket', 'os', 'sys', 'thread', 'json', 'requests', and performs network and file operations. This pattern is typical of obfuscated malicious scripts aiming to run arbitrary commands or exfiltrate data. The use of exec with decoded code is a significant security concern, indicating potentially malicious behavior. The code appears intentionally obfuscated, with no clear purpose beyond executing embedded code.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious pattern involving decoding and executing obfuscated code, which could lead to arbitrary command execution, data exfiltration, or other malicious actions. It is highly suspicious and should be treated as malicious.",
