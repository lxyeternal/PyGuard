{
  "purpose": "The code provides two functions, one simple arithmetic operation and another that decodes and executes base64-encoded Python code.",
  "sources": "The second function imports modules and executes dynamically decoded code from a base64 string.",
  "sinks": "exec() on decoded base64 content, which can run arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "Input parameter 'number' is used in arithmetic; the decoded code runs independently, not directly connected to 'number'.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding followed by exec() is suspicious; the code appears obfuscated and potentially malicious.",
  "analysis": "The first function 'nDiqrKJXAuFMoRAbcUNmDyuBOyfALtJK' performs a benign increment operation. The second function 'fPkUBBjeUpaHoaDPfZhBAVUKiQSsEkIR' imports modules, then decodes a base64 string, and executes the resulting code. The decoded code likely contains malicious behavior, such as further code execution or data exfiltration, typical in obfuscated malicious scripts. This pattern indicates an attempt to hide malicious intent by encoding code and executing it dynamically. The use of exec() on decoded code is a significant security concern, especially without validation or constraints.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious obfuscation via base64 decoding and dynamic execution, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent. It is strongly advised to treat this as malicious and not execute it in production environments.",
