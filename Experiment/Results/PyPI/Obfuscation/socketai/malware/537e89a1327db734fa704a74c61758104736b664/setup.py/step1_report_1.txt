{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package that includes additional functions for downloading, decrypting, and executing a binary payload from a URL determined by the system architecture.",
  "sources": "Reads include environment variables, system architecture info, and network requests to external URLs. The code reads data from a URL with requests.get and from files in a directory tree during installation.",
  "sinks": "Potentially executes a downloaded file via subprocess.Popen, writes data to a file in the local filesystem, and reads files from specific directories during installation.",
  "flows": "System info (architecture) influences URL selection. Downloaded content is XOR-decrypted with a key derived from the code, then saved and executed. Files from specific directories are read, decrypted, and used as part of a verification or trigger process.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses obfuscated variable names, custom hashing, and XOR-based decryption, which are often indicators of attempts to hide malicious intent. It downloads and executes a binary without obvious user consent, and uses complex, unclear cryptography to decrypt data, which could be obfuscation. The presence of hardcoded hex-encoded data and dynamic code execution suggests malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script is a customized setup process that fetches data from external URLs based on system architecture, decrypts this data using XOR with a key derived via SHA3-512 hashing, writes the resulting binary to a file in a local directory, sets executable permissions, and then executes it asynchronously. It also scans directories for specific files, decrypts data in files, and performs a validation check based on a cryptographic match. The obfuscated variable names, cryptographic operations, and execution of downloaded content are typical indicators of malicious or sabotage intent. The code does not include user prompts or clear documentation, which is suspicious. The process could be used to install a backdoor or malicious payload during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits multiple signs of malicious behavior, including dynamic code execution, obfuscation, network activity with encrypted payloads, and indirect control flow. It is likely designed to download and run malicious binaries during installation, constituting a high security risk. The package should be considered unsafe for use.",
