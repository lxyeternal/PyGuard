      "conclusion": "The code is malicious, actively downloading, decrypting, and executing remote payloads during installation. Its obfuscation and cryptographic techniques are used to hide malicious intent. It poses a severe security threat, capable of establishing persistence or backdoors. The behavior is consistent with malware, and the code should be treated as highly dangerous."
