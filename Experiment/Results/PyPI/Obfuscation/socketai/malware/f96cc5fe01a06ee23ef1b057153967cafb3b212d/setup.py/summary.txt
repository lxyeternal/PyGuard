  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to the use of obfuscated, stealthy PowerShell execution embedded within a package setup script. The techniques employed are consistent with malicious payload delivery or backdoor mechanisms. The high obfuscation, hidden execution, and error suppression justify assigning high malware and security risk scores."
