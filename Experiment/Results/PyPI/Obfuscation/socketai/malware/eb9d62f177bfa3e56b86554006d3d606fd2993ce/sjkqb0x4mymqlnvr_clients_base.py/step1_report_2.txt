{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for event clients that handle sending events with validation and logging.",
  "sources": "event_type parameter in __init__ and send_event; timestamp in send_event; logger in __init__ and send_event",
  "sinks": "self._send_event method (though it is abstract), logging calls",
  "flows": "Initialization uses event_type; send_event uses event_data, event_type, timestamp, logger; logs data before calling _send_event",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded credentials, no data leaks, and no insecure operations detected",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a structured approach to sending events, validating inputs, and logging. It relies on subclasses to implement actual event-sending logic. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are present. The use of standard libraries, validation, and logging is appropriate. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard abstract class designed for event handling with proper validation and logging. It does not contain malware, malicious intent, or security risks based on the provided content.",
