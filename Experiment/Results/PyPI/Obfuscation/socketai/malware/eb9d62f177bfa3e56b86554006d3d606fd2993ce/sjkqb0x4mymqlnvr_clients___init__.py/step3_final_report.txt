  "purpose": "Assess open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code analysis, suspicious patterns, and potential vulnerabilities.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, network connections, file operations, external library calls, code execution points.",
  "sinks": "Network transmissions, file writes, environment variable access, system commands, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Input sources (env vars, user input) to sinks (network, file, system commands) via code logic, data processing, or external calls.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, suspicious network domains, obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, unusual data flows, hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code shows no evidence of malicious payloads, suspicious network activity, or obfuscation. It appears to perform standard data processing or system interaction. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are detected. The code's complexity does not imply malicious intent, and no suspicious patterns are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.7) are consistent with the benign assessment. The lack of concrete code snippets limits certainty, but overall, the code appears safe. The low security risk score reflects minor concerns due to complexity, but no confirmed vulnerabilities exist.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, and the malware likelihood is negligible. The assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.75,
