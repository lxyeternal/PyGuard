      "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior through covert collection and exfiltration of sensitive system information to an external server. The activity is suspicious, unauthorized, and indicative of a supply chain attack or malicious package. The malware score should be set to 1, and the security risk score should also be at maximum (1), given the severity of the data theft."

The primary security concern is endpoint trustworthiness, which is a configuration issue rather than a code flaw. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."

      "conclusion": "Based on the provided reports, there is no confirmed malicious activity. Obfuscation is noted but not definitively malicious. The current malware scores (0 to 0.2) and obfuscation scores (up to 0.7) are appropriate. Risk levels are moderate where obfuscation is high, but overall, the dependency appears safe. Continued monitoring and dynamic analysis are recommended if code becomes available."

      "conclusion": "Most code snippets are benign, but report 4 demonstrates behaviors indicative of potential malicious activity, such as dynamic execution and hardcoded network addresses. Slightly increasing the malware score for report 4 improves alignment with observed suspicious patterns. Overall, the security risk remains moderate, and the current scoring is justified."
