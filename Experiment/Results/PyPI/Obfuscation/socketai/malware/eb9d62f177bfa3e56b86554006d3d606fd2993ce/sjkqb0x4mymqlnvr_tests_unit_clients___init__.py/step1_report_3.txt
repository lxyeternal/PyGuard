  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be a generic utility or script, but without explicit context or comments, its exact intent is unclear.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input functions, environment variables, and possibly external modules or files.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or subprocess executions, depending on further code details.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs, environment variables) to sinks (network, files, subprocesses), but specifics cannot be determined without code details.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious function calls are detected from the provided code snippet.",
  "analysis": "Step 1: Review the initial code for input reading or environment variable access; Step 2: Check for network or file operations; Step 3: Identify any dynamic code execution or obfuscated patterns; Step 4: Assess for suspicious logic or hardcoded secrets; Step 5: Confirm absence of malicious payloads or backdoors. Since no actual code was provided, the analysis is based on the structure and typical patterns. Without specific code, detailed risk assessment is limited.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of visible suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious operations, the code does not show clear signs of malicious behavior. However, due to lack of detailed code, the confidence in this assessment is moderate.",
