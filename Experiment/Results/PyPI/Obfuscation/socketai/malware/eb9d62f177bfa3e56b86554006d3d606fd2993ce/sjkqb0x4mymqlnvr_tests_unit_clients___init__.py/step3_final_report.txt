  "purpose": "Assessment of supply chain security for a Python package based on provided code analysis reports.",
  "sources": "Not applicable; no code provided in reports.",
  "sinks": "Not applicable; no code analysis performed.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no code to trace data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code; suspicious patterns described in some reports include obfuscation, dynamic execution, suspicious network activity, and hardcoded endpoints.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify the absence of code or benign code patterns, assigning low or zero scores for malware and obfuscation where appropriate. Report 4 describes suspicious behaviors such as obfuscation and dynamic code execution, justifying higher malware (0.6), obfuscated (0.75), and security risk (0.7) scores. Other reports with no code or benign descriptions have appropriately low scores. Minor adjustments could be made to report 3's risk score from 0.3 to 0.2 for consistency, but current scores are reasonable. Overall, the scoring aligns with the descriptions and observed patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The provided scores are consistent with the reports' descriptions. Report 4 indicates potential malicious activity and obfuscation, warranting higher scores, while other reports are appropriately scored as benign or low risk. No significant revisions are necessary; the assessments are justified based on the available information.",
