  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured HTTP client for event reporting with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary security concern is endpoint trustworthiness, which is a configuration issue rather than a code flaw. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
