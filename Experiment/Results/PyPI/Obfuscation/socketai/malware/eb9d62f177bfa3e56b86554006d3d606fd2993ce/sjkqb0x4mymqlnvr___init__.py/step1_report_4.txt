  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script that initializes some variables and performs simple operations, possibly related to data processing or configuration. There is no clear indication of malicious intent based on the visible content.",
  "sources": "Reading of environment variables, input data via function parameters, or file I/O if present (not visible in the provided snippet).",
  "sinks": "Potential data output to files, network transmission functions, or database queries if implemented (not visible here).",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or inputs through processing functions to sinks such as output functions or network calls (not explicitly detailed in the provided code).",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code are evident in the visible code. The code structure is straightforward with no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and standard, with no signs of malicious behavior. No suspicious imports, obfuscated segments, or unusual control flow are present. Without additional context or hidden code, there are no indications of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no apparent malicious behaviors or security issues. The code seems benign, but a more comprehensive review with the full source could be necessary for certainty.",
