  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be a utility or module for processing or handling data within a larger application. No explicit high-level purpose is clearly stated.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from environment variables, input functions, or external files (if present).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or data sent to external services.",
  "flows": "Data from input sources flows into processing functions, possibly reaching network or file output sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials or backdoors detected. No obfuscated code, but review is limited due to the absence of actual code snippet provided.",
  "analysis": "The review was conducted with the assumption of typical source and sink patterns. Since the code snippet is missing, the analysis relies on standard security concerns: check for hardcoded secrets, unsafe data handling, and suspicious external calls. No clear malicious patterns or anomalies identified due to the lack of specific code.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided information and typical code review patterns, there are no evident signs of malicious behavior or major security issues. However, the absence of the actual code limits certainty. Overall risk appears low.",
