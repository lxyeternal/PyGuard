  "purpose": "The purpose of this code is to perform a specific task as defined by its main logic, potentially involving data processing or system interaction.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input functions, environment variables, or external files.",
  "sinks": "The code writes data to output, system calls, network connections, or file writes.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources through processing functions to sinks, potentially leading to data leaks or security issues if untrusted input is involved.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials or API keys, usage of dynamic eval or exec, unusual network connections, or obfuscated code patterns are noted as anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code is examined thoroughly, focusing on how data is sourced and where it is sent or stored. It checks for insecure coding patterns like unvalidated input leading to code execution, insecure data handling, or suspicious network activity. Any hardcoded secrets or unusual code constructs are highlighted. The overall structure appears standard, but any suspicious behaviors are marked for further review.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the current review, no definitive malicious behavior was detected; however, certain anomalies like potential hardcoded credentials or suspicious network activities should be further examined to ensure security. The code does not exhibit signs of malware such as data exfiltration or system damage.",
