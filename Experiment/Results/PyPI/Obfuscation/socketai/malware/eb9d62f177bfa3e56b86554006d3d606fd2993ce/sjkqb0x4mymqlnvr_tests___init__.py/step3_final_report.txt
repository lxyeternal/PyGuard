  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks, focusing on obfuscation, suspicious functions, data leaks, or backdoors.",
  "sources": "Input data reads (e.g., stdin, environment variables), potential network connections, file operations, dynamic code execution points.",
  "sinks": "Network transmissions, file writes, environment variable access, dynamic eval/exec calls, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources to sinks via variable assignments, function calls, or dynamic execution pathways.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation (e.g., complex logic, string encoding), hardcoded secrets, suspicious function usage, unusual code structure, or hidden code paths.",
  "analysis": "The code is largely unavailable, but reports indicate high obfuscation in some cases (scores up to 0.7), with no explicit malicious functions such as eval() or network calls identified. The suspicion stems from complexity and obfuscation rather than concrete malicious indicators. Scores for malware remain low (around 0.2), consistent with the absence of direct evidence. Obfuscation scores are justified based on the reported complexity. Risk scores are moderate (around 0.3-0.4) mainly due to obfuscation, which could conceal malicious intent. The reports' reasoning aligns with the evidence, and no significant discrepancies are observed.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided reports, there is no confirmed malicious activity. Obfuscation is noted but not definitively malicious. The current malware scores (0 to 0.2) and obfuscation scores (up to 0.7) are appropriate. Risk levels are moderate where obfuscation is high, but overall, the dependency appears safe. Continued monitoring and dynamic analysis are recommended if code becomes available.",
