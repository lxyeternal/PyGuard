  "conclusion": "Based on the provided reports, there is no confirmed malicious activity. Obfuscation is noted but not definitively malicious. The current malware scores (0 to 0.2) and obfuscation scores (up to 0.7) are appropriate. Risk levels are moderate where obfuscation is high, but overall, the dependency appears safe. Continued monitoring and dynamic analysis are recommended if code becomes available."
