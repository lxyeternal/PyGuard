  "purpose": "Evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on suspicious patterns such as dynamic execution, hardcoded network addresses, unsafe subprocess calls, obfuscation, and data leaks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, function parameters, hardcoded IPs/URLs, network request functions, subprocess calls, dynamic code execution points, input reading points.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission points, subprocess execution commands, dynamic code execution functions (`exec`), file system modifications, environment variable access, data exfiltration channels.",
  "flows": "Input sources (environment variables, parameters, hardcoded addresses) leading to dynamic execution (`exec`), network requests, subprocess calls, or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of `exec` with untrusted data, hardcoded IPs/URLs, unsafe subprocess calls without validation, minimal error handling, moderate code obfuscation, dynamic code execution patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code contains suspicious patterns such as use of `exec` with untrusted data, hardcoded network addresses, and unsafe subprocess calls, indicating potential malicious intent. Obfuscation is moderate but not extensive. The majority of the code appears benign, with no hardcoded secrets or overt malicious behavior. The scores assigned in reports 1-3 are justified; report 4 exhibits significant suspicious activity, warranting higher malware (suggested increase from 0.5 to 0.6) and risk scores (from 0.6 to 0.65). Report 5 shows moderate suspicion, consistent with its scores. Overall, the assessment aligns with observed patterns, and the scores are appropriate, with slight adjustments recommended for report 4 to better reflect the severity of its suspicious features.",
  "conclusion": "Most code snippets are benign, but report 4 demonstrates behaviors indicative of potential malicious activity, such as dynamic execution and hardcoded network addresses. Slightly increasing the malware score for report 4 improves alignment with observed suspicious patterns. Overall, the security risk remains moderate, and the current scoring is justified.",
