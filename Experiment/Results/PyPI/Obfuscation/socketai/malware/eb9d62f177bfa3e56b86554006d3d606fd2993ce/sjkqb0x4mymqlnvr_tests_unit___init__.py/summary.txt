  "conclusion": "Most code snippets are benign, but report 4 demonstrates behaviors indicative of potential malicious activity, such as dynamic execution and hardcoded network addresses. Slightly increasing the malware score for report 4 improves alignment with observed suspicious patterns. Overall, the security risk remains moderate, and the current scoring is justified."
