      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential due to executing an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during package setup. The pattern aligns with common malware tactics such as payload download or backdoor installation. The scores in the reports are appropriate and justified by the behavior observed."
