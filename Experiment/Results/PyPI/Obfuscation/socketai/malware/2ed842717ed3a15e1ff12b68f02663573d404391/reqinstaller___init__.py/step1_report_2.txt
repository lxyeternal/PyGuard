{
  "purpose": "Download and execute a remote executable file, likely to run an external program or malware.",
  "sources": "The URL from which the executable is downloaded.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the downloaded file via subprocess.call().",
  "flows": "requests.get() retrieves the file content -> saved to a temporary file -> subprocess.call() executes the temporary file.",
  "anomalies": "Downloading an executable from a remote URL and executing it without validation is suspicious. The filename and variable names appear obfuscated or intentionally obscure.",
  "analysis": "The code downloads a binary executable from a Discord CDN link, saves it temporarily, and then runs it directly. No validation, checksum, or sandboxing is performed. The pattern of fetching and executing external code is typical of malicious behavior, especially given the use of a Discord URL which is often used to bypass traditional security controls. The variable names are obfuscated, and there is no indication of any validation or user interaction. This strongly suggests malicious intent, possibly to run malicious code or malware without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "The script downloads and executes an external binary from a remote server, which is characteristic of malicious activity or malware delivery. The lack of validation, obfuscated variables, and the context of executing downloaded code confirm high suspicion of malicious behavior.",
