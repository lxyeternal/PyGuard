      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation and stealthy execution of an encoded PowerShell command during package setup, consistent with malicious activity. The high scores assigned in the reports are justified and reflect the potential threat. No false positives are evident; the behavior warrants caution and further investigation."
