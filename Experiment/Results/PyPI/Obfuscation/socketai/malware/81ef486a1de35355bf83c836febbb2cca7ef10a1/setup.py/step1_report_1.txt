{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, with an embedded malicious attempt to run hidden PowerShell code.",
  "sources": "Code reads the file system to check for the existence of 'tahg', and executes a subprocess to run encoded PowerShell commands.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess execution of PowerShell with encoded commands, potentially executing malicious payloads without user awareness.",
  "flows": "Checks for 'tahg' -> if not found, runs PowerShell encoded command via subprocess -> hidden execution without user interaction.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a base64-encoded PowerShell command executed with hidden window style, without any explanation or documentation. The command appears obfuscated and is likely malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with a standard setup call but then attempts to check for a specific file. If absent, it executes a subprocess running an encoded PowerShell command with hidden window style. The encoded command suggests obfuscated or malicious activity, potentially downloading or executing additional payloads. The code suppresses exceptions, hiding any errors that could reveal malicious activity. The setup function includes only metadata, which appears benign but is overshadowed by the hidden subprocess call. Overall, the code exhibits suspicious behavior, especially the hidden PowerShell execution with encoded commands.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains malicious behavior intended to run concealed PowerShell code, likely for malicious purposes such as downloading, executing, or maintaining persistence. The obfuscation and hidden execution strongly suggest malicious intent.",
