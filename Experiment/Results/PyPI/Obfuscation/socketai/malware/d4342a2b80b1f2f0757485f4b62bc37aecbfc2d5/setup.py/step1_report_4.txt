  "flows": "File existence check -> if condition -> subprocess.Popen with encoded command.",
  "anomalies": "Encoded PowerShell command executed via subprocess without validation; use of try-except to suppress errors; absence of documentation explaining the command's purpose.",
  "analysis": "The script checks for the existence of a directory 'tahg'. If it does not exist, it executes a subprocess running a PowerShell command with a base64-encoded payload, hidden from the user. The code then proceeds to run the setup function for a package with generic metadata. The encoded PowerShell command is suspicious because such encoding often conceals malicious activities, such as downloading or executing further payloads, especially when run without validation. The suppression of exceptions via broad try-except blocks suggests an attempt to hide failures or malicious activity. The setup code itself appears benign but is likely secondary to the obfuscated subprocess execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code's primary suspicious element is the encoded PowerShell command executed in a hidden window, which could be used to download or run malicious payloads. The setup process appears standard and safe but is likely used to mask malicious activity, making this potentially malicious code with a high likelihood of harmful intent.",
