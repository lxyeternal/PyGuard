  "purpose": "The script appears to set up a Python package with specific metadata, but also executes a hidden PowerShell command upon first run.",
  "sources": "The code reads the filesystem to check for the existence of 'tahg' and executes a subprocess if it doesn't exist.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess call executes a PowerShell command with encoded content, which could be malicious.",
  "flows": "Checks for 'tahg' -> If not exists, runs the encoded PowerShell command, potentially leading to malicious payload execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'subprocess.Popen' with a hidden window and encoded PowerShell command is suspicious. The encoded command may contain malicious code. No clear benign reason for this behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup utilities, then attempts to check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg'. If absent, it executes a subprocess that runs a PowerShell command with hidden window style and encoded payload, likely obfuscated malicious code. The command is base64-encoded, which is commonly used to hide malicious intent. The second try block executes the 'setup' function with package metadata, which appears benign. The primary concern is the encoded PowerShell command executed conditionally, indicating potential malicious activity. No other suspicious behavior or hardcoded credentials are present, but the encoded payload's purpose is unclear and likely malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily performs package setup but also executes a hidden, encoded PowerShell command when the 'tahg' directory is absent. This behavior is suspicious and suggests possible malicious intent, such as executing hidden payloads or backdoors. The overall risk is high due to the encoded command execution with no clear benign purpose.",
