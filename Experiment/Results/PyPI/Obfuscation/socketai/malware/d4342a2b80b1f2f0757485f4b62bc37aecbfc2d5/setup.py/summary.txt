  "security_risk": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command triggered conditionally. The high scores assigned by the reports are justified. Further decoding of the payload is recommended for definitive confirmation, but current analysis warrants classifying this as highly malicious and risky."
