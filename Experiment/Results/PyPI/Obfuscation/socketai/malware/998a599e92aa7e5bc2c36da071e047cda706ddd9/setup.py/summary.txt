  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, executing arbitrary code during package installation on Windows systems. The encrypted payload and obfuscation are typical of malicious packages aiming to evade detection. The use of exec() on decrypted data confirms active malicious behavior, warranting high malware and security risk scores."
