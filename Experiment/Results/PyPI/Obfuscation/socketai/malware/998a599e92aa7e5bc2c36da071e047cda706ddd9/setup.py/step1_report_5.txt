{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package with some obfuscated code that executes a decryption and remote code execution if run on Windows.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment info (os.name), hardcoded strings, and decrypts embedded data. It also imports potentially malicious modules 'requests' and 'fernet'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'exec' on decrypted code, which may run arbitrary code. Importing 'requests' and 'fernet' may facilitate network activity or decryption of payloads.",
  "flows": "If on Windows, the code imports modules, decrypts a payload, and executes it with 'exec'. The setup configuration is also executed, but does not appear to be malicious directly.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, encrypted payload executed via 'exec', and inclusion of 'requests' and 'fernet' without clear purpose suggest malicious intent. The use of 'exec' with decrypted code is suspicious. The code decrypts and runs remote or hidden code on Windows systems.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with obfuscated variable names and encrypted data, indicating intent to hide malicious behavior. The class 'DCIHtYwmOjgEtVnVeuFKVxyfTmejMDVt' extends 'install' and overrides a method that, when run on Windows ('nt'), imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then decrypts and executes a payload. This payload could be malicious. The setup call includes the malicious class as part of the installation process. The overall structure and encrypted payload execution strongly suggest malicious activity, likely to run arbitrary code during installation or runtime, especially on Windows systems. The presence of 'exec' on decrypted data is a high indicator of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, encrypted payload execution triggered on Windows during package installation, indicating malicious behavior. It aims to run arbitrary code without clear user knowledge, representing a security risk.",
