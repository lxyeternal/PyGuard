{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package with obfuscated strings and a custom install class that executes decrypted code on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "Obfuscated string variables, the 'exec' statement inside the custom install class, environment check (os.name), imported modules 'requests' and 'fernet'.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing decrypted code, possibly malicious, on Windows systems; use of 'requests' and 'fernet' suggests potential network communication or decryption of payloads.",
  "flows": "On Windows, the 'exec' decrypts and runs code when the custom install class is invoked, representing a source-to-sink flow that executes code dynamically based on environment and decrypted content.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated variable names and strings, use of 'exec' with decrypted code, the presence of network-related modules ('requests') and encryption ('fernet') used in a way that suggests dynamic code execution; the string variables are nonsensical and obfuscated.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up a Python package with an obfuscated custom install class. Inside this class, on Windows ('nt'), it imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then decrypts a base64-encoded payload and executes it via 'exec'. The obfuscation and dynamic execution strongly suggest malicious intent, as this pattern is typical of malicious package behaviors (e.g., downloading or executing malicious code at install time). The variables are nonsensical, and the code appears designed to hide its true purpose. While the package appears to be a standard setup configuration, the runtime behavior is suspicious, involving environment checks, decryption, and code execution, which can lead to system compromise or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains obfuscated code that dynamically decrypts and executes code during installation on Windows systems, indicating malicious intent. The use of 'exec' with decrypted code is a common malware tactic. Due to obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and environment-specific behavior, this package should be considered malicious.",
