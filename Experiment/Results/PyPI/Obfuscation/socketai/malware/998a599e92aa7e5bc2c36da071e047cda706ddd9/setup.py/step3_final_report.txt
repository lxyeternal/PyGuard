{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration that, during installation on Windows, decrypts and executes a payload using a hardcoded Fernet key, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Encrypted payload string, environment check (os.name), hardcoded Fernet key",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing decrypted code",
  "flows": "On Windows, the code imports requests and fernet, decrypts the payload with the hardcoded key, then executes it via exec()",
  "anomalies": "Encrypted payload and Fernet key embedded in code, obfuscated variable names, conditional execution only on Windows, use of exec() on decrypted data",
  "analysis": "The code contains a custom install class that, when run on Windows, imports network and cryptography modules, decrypts an encrypted payload with a hardcoded key, and executes it dynamically. The variable names and strings are obfuscated, indicating an attempt to conceal malicious activity. The use of exec() on decrypted data during installation is a significant security concern, suggesting remote code execution capabilities. The pattern is consistent with malicious backdoors or trojans embedded in packages. The high degree of obfuscation, encrypted payload, and environment-specific activation strongly suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, executing arbitrary code during package installation on Windows systems. The encrypted payload and obfuscation are typical of malicious packages aiming to evade detection. The use of exec() on decrypted data confirms active malicious behavior, warranting high malware and security risk scores.",
