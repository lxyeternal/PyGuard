{
  "purpose": "Configure and set up a Python package for distribution, including dynamic package and binary names based on environment variables and directory structure.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'PACKAGE_AS_FABRIC2', reading files ('_version.py', 'README.rst'), os.path.isdir checks, and package name logic.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function call, which installs dependencies, package data, and entry points.",
  "flows": "Environment variable and directory checks influence package name and binary name; file reads determine version; setup() uses these variables for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. Use of exec() to read '_version.py' could be risky if the file contents are malicious, but this is a common pattern for version extraction. No external network activity or malicious code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically determines package and binary names based on environment variables and directory checks, then reads version info from a local file. It proceeds to set up package metadata and dependencies using setuptools. The use of exec() on a local file is a typical pattern but could be risky if the file is tampered with. No external data leaks, network activity, or malicious behavior observed. No obfuscation or malware signatures detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package setup script with no malicious intent. It dynamically configures package parameters based on local environment and directory structure, and uses common patterns for Python packaging. No security risks or malware are detected.",
