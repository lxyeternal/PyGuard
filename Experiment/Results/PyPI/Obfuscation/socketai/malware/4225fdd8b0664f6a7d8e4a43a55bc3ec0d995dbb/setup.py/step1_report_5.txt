{
  "purpose": "This code configures and sets up a Python package for distribution, including selecting package names based on environment variables and directory presence, and preparing installation requirements.",
  "sources": "Environment variables ('PACKAGE_AS_FABRIC2'), filesystem directories ('fabric2', 'fabric'), package files ('_version.py'), and README file.",
  "sinks": "setuptools.setup() function which writes package metadata, installs dependencies, and creates console scripts.",
  "flows": "Environment variable and directory checks influence package and binary names, which then affect the setup configuration and entry point creation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. The code uses standard package setup procedures with no obfuscated or unusual language features. All dependencies appear legitimate; no unusual network or system calls are present.",
  "analysis": "The script dynamically determines package and binary names based on environment variables and directory structure, then reads a version file and README content, and finally calls setuptools.setup() to configure packaging. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data leakage, or suspicious network activity. All code is standard for Python package setup, with no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code. It is primarily a configuration script with typical dependency declarations and entry point setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It employs common practices for package configuration, and no suspicious behaviors are detected.",
