{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package with conditional configuration based on environment variables and directory structure, and prepares metadata for distribution via setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables ('PACKAGE_AS_FABRIC2'), reads the filesystem ('fabric2' and 'fabric' directories), reads the '_version.py' file within the package directory, and reads 'README.rst' for long description.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'setuptools.setup()' to define package metadata and dependencies, which are standard for package distribution.",
  "flows": "Environment variable influences 'package_name' and 'binary_name' -> Directory checks influence package selection -> Reading version from '_version.py' -> Reading README content for description -> Passing all data into 'setuptools.setup()'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. The code performs typical setup tasks. No suspicious network activity, code injection, or obfuscation observed. Use of 'exec()' on '_version.py' is standard for version management and does not pose a malicious threat in this context.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs environment-based configuration and setup tasks. It reads environment variables to determine package variant, checks for directory presence, executes a version file, and reads a README file. All operations are typical for Python package setup scripts. The use of 'exec()' is common for dynamic version assignment, and there is no indication of malicious intent. Dependencies and entry points are defined in a standard manner. No anomalies, suspicious behaviors, or malware patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with conditional configuration. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are detected. It appears to be a legitimate package configuration script.",
