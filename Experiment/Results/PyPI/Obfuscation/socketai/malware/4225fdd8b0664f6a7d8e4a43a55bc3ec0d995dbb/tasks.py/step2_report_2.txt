  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, and the overall security risk based on the code and the reports.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes automation for packaging, testing, and deployment. Uses environment variables, sys.path, and user inputs.\n- **Sinks:** Uses c.run for shell commands, manipulates environment variables.\n- **Anomalies:** Hardcoded credentials ('sikrit', 'sudouser', 'mypass'), direct sys.path manipulation, environment variables with sensitive info.\n- **Analysis:** No obfuscated code or malware signatures. The code is standard automation with security concerns mainly due to hardcoded secrets.\n- **Conclusion:** Medium security risk; no malicious intent or malware detected.\n\n**Score Justification:**\n- Malware: 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (no obfuscation)\n- Risk: 0.6 (hardcoded secrets, environment manipulation)\n\n**Recommendation:** The score seems reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Build, test, release tasks; environment variables, user input.\n- **Sinks:** c.run commands, storing sensitive data.\n- **Anomalies:** Static credentials ('some-gateway', 'sikrit', 'admin', 'localghost', '2222', 'mypass') are present.\n- **Analysis:** No obfuscation or malware; the code is typical build automation with insecure hardcoded secrets.\n- **Conclusion:** Moderate security concern, no malicious activity.\n\n**Score Justification:**\n- Malware: 0 (no malware signatures)\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0.6 (due to hardcoded secrets)\n\n**Recommendation:** The score aligns with the analysis; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Build, test, release; environment variables, hardcoded secrets.\n- **Sinks:** c.run, environment variable modifications, fabric environment settings.\n- **Anomalies:** Hardcoded credentials ('sikrit', 'some-gateway', 'admin', 'localghost', '2222'), sys.path removal.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious code or obfuscation; insecure handling of secrets is a concern.\n- **Conclusion:** Insecure practices but no malware.\n\n**Score Justification:**\n- Malware: 0.3 (slightly higher, possibly due to the nature of fabric connections and environment manipulation)\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0.4 (somewhat lower than others, but still notable)\n\n**Recommendation:** The malware score could be slightly higher if considering potential misuse of fabric connections, but since no actual malicious code is present, 0.3 is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Build, release, testing; environment variables, configuration data.\n- **Sinks:** c.run, environment variables, fabric env.\n- **Anomalies:** Hardcoded credentials ('sikrit', 'some-gateway', 'admin', 'localghost', '2222'), sys.path manipulation.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious code, just insecure secrets.\n- **Conclusion:** Insecure but not malicious.\n\n**Score Justification:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0.3 (less than others, as the code is straightforward)\n\n**Recommendation:** The scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Automation tasks, environment variables, configuration.\n- **Sinks:** c.run, environment variables, fabric environment.\n- **Anomalies:** Hardcoded secrets ('sikrit', 'some-gateway', 'localghost', '2222').\n- **Analysis:** No malware or obfuscation; insecure secrets are the main concern.\n- **Conclusion:** Low malware risk, insecure practices.\n\n**Score Justification:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0.3\n\n**Recommendation:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All reports correctly indicate no malware (mostly 0, with one at 0.3 for potential misuse but no actual malicious code).\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, as code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slight variations, but generally moderate due to hardcoded secrets and environment manipulations.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\nConsidering all reports and the code:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code or backdoors detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.5 (medium risk due to hardcoded secrets, environment manipulation, but no active malicious activity)\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type | Estimated Value |\n|--------------|-----------------|\n| Malware      | 0               |\n| Obfuscated   | 0               |\n| Risk         | 0.5             |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is primarily automation with security weaknesses (hardcoded secrets, environment manipulation). No malware or obfuscation is evident. The overall risk is moderate, mainly due to insecure secrets, but not malicious in intent.",
