  "purpose": "Automation scripts for packaging, testing, and deployment of the software project.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, hardcoded credentials, imported modules, and code arguments.",
  "sinks": "Shell commands via c.run, environment variable manipulations, sys.path modifications, and configuration objects.",
  "flows": "Input sources such as environment variables and hardcoded secrets flow into commands and environment configurations, potentially exposing sensitive data or affecting execution.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded credentials ('sikrit', 'mypass', 'some-gateway', 'localghost', 'admin', '2222'), direct sys.path manipulation, and use of static secrets in code.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily automates build, test, and release tasks with standard patterns. It contains hardcoded secrets and environment variable handling, which are security concerns but no evidence of malicious payloads or obfuscation. No functions or code segments indicate backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious network activity. The use of static credentials and environment manipulations increases security risk but does not constitute malware. The code's structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation techniques present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical automation script with insecure handling of secrets and environment variables. There is no malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The security risk is moderate due to exposure of secrets but does not involve malware or sabotage.",
