  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit malicious behavior but contains significant security risks due to hardcoded credentials and secrets. There is no evidence of malware, backdoors, or obfuscation. The primary concern is the insecure handling of secrets, which could be exploited if the code is shared or compromised. The overall security risk is moderate to high, primarily driven by credential exposure."
