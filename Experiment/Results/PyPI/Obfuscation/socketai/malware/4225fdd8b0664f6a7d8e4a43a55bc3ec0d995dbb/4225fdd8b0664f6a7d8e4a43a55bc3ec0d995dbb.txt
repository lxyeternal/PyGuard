There is no evidence of malware, backdoors, or obfuscation. The primary concern is the insecure handling of secrets, which could be exploited if the code is shared or compromised. The overall security risk is moderate to high, primarily driven by credential exposure."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits obfuscation and risky dynamic execution but lacks evidence of malicious activity. The primary concern is the potential for malicious code execution if '_version.py' is compromised. No malware is detected, but the use of exec() introduces a security risk that warrants attention. The scores across reports are appropriate, with a slight increase in risk score justified by the potential danger of executing untrusted code."

The overall security risk is moderate, and malware suspicion is present but not confirmed. Further behavioral analysis is recommended."

The overall security risk is moderate, primarily due to obfuscation and potential for covert behavior, but no confirmed malicious actions are present. The malware likelihood remains low to moderate."
