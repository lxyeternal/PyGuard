  "conclusion": "The code exhibits obfuscation and risky dynamic execution but lacks evidence of malicious activity. The primary concern is the potential for malicious code execution if '_version.py' is compromised. No malware is detected, but the use of exec() introduces a security risk that warrants attention. The scores across reports are appropriate, with a slight increase in risk score justified by the potential danger of executing untrusted code."
