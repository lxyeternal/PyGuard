{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for extracting sensitive user information such as Discord tokens, passwords, cookies, and other personal data from web browsers, Discord installations, and file systems, then exfiltrating this data to a remote webhook and hosting sites.",
  "sources": "Data sources include browser profile directories, local storage, leveldb files, log and database files, and files in user directories such as Desktop, Downloads, and Documents.",
  "sinks": "The code sends exfiltrated data via HTTP POST requests to a remote Discord webhook URL and uploads files to anonymous file hosting services (gofile.io, anonfiles.com). It also executes system commands like killing processes and installing packages.",
  "flows": "Sensitive data such as tokens, passwords, cookies, and files are read from local files and databases, decrypted, and then sent over the network to external servers via requests and urlopen calls. Data flows from local sources to remote webhook and hosting sites.",
  "anomalies": "Includes attempts to install dependencies dynamically, forcibly kill processes, decrypt browser data, and exfiltrate sensitive user information. Use of hardcoded webhook URL, extensive browser and system data extraction, and process termination indicate malicious intent. Also, the code installs modules and then uses them without verification, which is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script is structured to harvest user credentials, tokens, cookies, and files from browsers, Discord, and common user directories. It decrypts stored passwords and cookies using Windows APIs and master keys. It also gathers data from third-party wallets and applications, zips relevant files, and uploads them to external services. The presence of hardcoded webhook URLs, broad data collection, process termination, and file uploading strongly indicates malicious behavior. No legitimate purpose for such extensive data exfiltration, particularly with process killing and silent dependency installation, is apparent. The code is obfuscated in behavior, and it performs operations that could harm user privacy and security.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly malicious, designed to steal Discord tokens, passwords, cookies, and files from a user’s system, then exfiltrate the data to a remote server. It also attempts to disable security measures and gather sensitive information broadly. Its primary purpose is malicious data theft with no legitimate utility. The overall security risk is extremely high, and the malware likelihood is confirmed.",
