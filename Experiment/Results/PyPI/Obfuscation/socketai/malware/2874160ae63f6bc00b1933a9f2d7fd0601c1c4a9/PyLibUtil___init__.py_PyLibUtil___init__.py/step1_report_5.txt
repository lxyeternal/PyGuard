{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed to extract sensitive user data from browsers (such as tokens, cookies, passwords), gather system information, steal files based on keywords, zip and upload them, and send all collected data to a Discord webhook, indicating malicious intent to compromise user privacy.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, local storage files, SQLite databases, log files, and folder contents related to browsers, Discord, Steam, and other applications.",
  "sinks": "Sending data via HTTP POST requests to a Discord webhook, uploading files to anonfiles.com, executing shell commands to kill processes, and installing packages via subprocess.",
  "flows": "Input sources (browser data, environment variables, files) are collected through file reading, database queries, regex extraction, and environment variable access. Data is then encrypted/decrypted, compiled into structured messages, and transmitted via HTTP requests or uploaded files, creating a clear source-to-sink flow aimed at exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded Discord webhook URL, code for bypassing security by installing dependencies, extensive use of threading for concurrent operations, cryptographic functions for decrypting protected data, and aggressive process termination commands. Also, the code actively kills certain processes, which is unusual for benign scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script functions as a multi-stage information stealer targeting user tokens, passwords, cookies, and files from popular browsers, Discord, Steam, and other applications. It decrypts stored credentials, gathers system and user info, and uploads the data to a Discord webhook and anonfiles.com. The code includes mechanisms for self-installation (dependency installation), threading for parallel processing, and file zipping and uploading. The presence of hardcoded webhook URL, process termination commands, and comprehensive data exfiltration points strongly indicate malicious intent. No obfuscation is evident; the code is straightforward but clearly designed for malicious data harvesting.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, functioning as a comprehensive data stealer that exfiltrates user credentials, tokens, cookies, files, and system information, sending all data to an attacker-controlled Discord webhook. It contains typical malware behaviors such as process termination, system data access, and file uploads, confirming its malicious purpose.",
