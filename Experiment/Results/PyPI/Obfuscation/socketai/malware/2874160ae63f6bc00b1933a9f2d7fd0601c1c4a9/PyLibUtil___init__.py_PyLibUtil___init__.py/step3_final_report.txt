{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract and decrypt sensitive user data such as tokens, passwords, cookies, system info, and files from browsers, Discord, wallets, and user directories, then exfiltrate this data via webhooks and file uploads. It also terminates related processes to facilitate data access.",
  "sources": "Browser storage files (.log, .ldb, SQLite databases), environment variables, user directories (Desktop, Downloads, Documents), application data folders (Steam, wallets, Discord), and local files.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to Discord webhooks and external file hosting services (anonfiles, gofile), file writes, process termination commands, and temporary file storage.",
  "flows": "Local data (browser files, credentials, tokens) flows through decryption routines and regex extraction into network requests and file uploads for exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded webhook URL, dynamic dependency installation via subprocess, process-killing commands for browsers and apps, threading for concurrent data collection, regex patterns used for token extraction, and decryption routines for Windows DPAPI and browser data.",
  "analysis": "The script performs extensive malicious activities: decrypts stored credentials, extracts tokens and cookies, collects files, zips and uploads data, terminates processes, and exfiltrates all via hardcoded webhooks. It employs threading for efficiency and includes routines to decrypt browser and Windows data. The code's behavior aligns with typical malware designed for credential theft and system infiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is unequivocally malicious, functioning as a comprehensive credential, token, cookie, and file stealer with active exfiltration and anti-debugging measures. Its behaviors justify a malware score of 1.0 and a security risk score of 1.0. Obfuscation is minimal, with regex patterns and dynamic module installs, warranting an obfuscation score around 0.2. Overall, it is a high-severity threat with no legitimate purpose.",
