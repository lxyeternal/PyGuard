  "conclusion": "Based on the available information, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks in the reviewed dependencies. The scores are appropriately conservative, and the assessments are justified given the lack of concrete code snippets. Continued monitoring and detailed code review are recommended if actual code becomes available or if suspicious patterns are later observed."
