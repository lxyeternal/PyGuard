      "conclusion": "The code is malicious, executing remote code during installation, representing a severe security threat. The obfuscation via base64 is typical but not complex. The behavior aligns with known supply chain attacks, and the scores assigned in the reports (malware: 1.0, obfuscated: 0.8, security risk: 1.0) are justified and consistent."

      "conclusion": "The code samples analyzed show varying degrees of suspicion, from benign to potentially malicious. The scoring aligns with the observed patterns, with reports 2 and 3 indicating moderate to high concern. Slightly increasing the malware and security risk scores for report 2 would improve accuracy. Overall, the assessments are sound, and further static or dynamic analysis is recommended for reports with higher suspicion."

      "conclusion": "Based on the available information, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks in the reviewed dependencies. The scores are appropriately conservative, and the assessments are justified given the lack of concrete code snippets. Continued monitoring and detailed code review are recommended if actual code becomes available or if suspicious patterns are later observed."
