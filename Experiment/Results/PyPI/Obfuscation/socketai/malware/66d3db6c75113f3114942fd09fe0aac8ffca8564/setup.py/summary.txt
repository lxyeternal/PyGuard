  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, executing remote code during installation, representing a severe security threat. The obfuscation via base64 is typical but not complex. The behavior aligns with known supply chain attacks, and the scores assigned in the reports (malware: 1.0, obfuscated: 0.8, security risk: 1.0) are justified and consistent."
