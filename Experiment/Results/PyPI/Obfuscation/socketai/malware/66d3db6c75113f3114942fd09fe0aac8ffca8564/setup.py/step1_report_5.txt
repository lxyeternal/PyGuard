  "purpose": "Define setup configuration for a Python package with embedded malicious code to execute during installation.",
  "sources": "The base64-encoded string within the notmalfunc() function, which is decoded and executed via os.system.",
  "sinks": "os.system() call executing decoded command that makes an HTTP request.",
  "flows": "The code decodes a base64 string to obtain a command, then executes it via os.system during package installation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding and execution of decoded string as a command, which is obfuscated and suspicious. The URL in the command suggests malicious intent (connecting to an external server). The function notmalfunc() is called during install, executing potentially malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools and defines functions to decode base64-encoded code. The function notmalfunc() decodes a string and executes it via os.system. The encoded string appears to be an HTTP URL ('http://192.168.1.34:8000/rev.sh') which suggests an external resource. This execution occurs during the 'install' command via the AfterInstall class. The code's structure hides the true intent, typical of malicious behavior. The URL and the execution of arbitrary commands during package install are clear indicators of malicious intent. No other security issues or obfuscation are evident beyond the decoding and execution pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by executing a decoded script from a base64 string during installation, likely connecting to a remote server for malicious purposes. This is indicative of a supply chain attack or malicious package.",
