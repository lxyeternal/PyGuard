{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup process that includes a malicious payload executed during installation, designed to fetch and potentially execute remote code.",
  "sources": "The base64-encoded string in the 'notmalfunc' function, which is decoded and executed via os.system",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executing decoded base64 code that makes an HTTP request to a remote server",
  "flows": "The 'notmalfunc' function is called during the 'AfterInstall' class run method, decoding base64 and executing it via os.system, leading to a network request",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding and os.system to execute remote code, which is obfuscated and suspicious; the URL points to an external server",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools for package setup and defines custom install and develop commands that extend the default behaviors. The 'notmalfunc' function decodes a base64 string which, when decoded, contains a curl command to make an HTTP request to an IP address. This function is invoked during the 'AfterInstall' class run method, which runs after the package installation. The code's use of base64 decoding, dynamic execution via os.system, and network communication with an external IP suggest malicious intent, possibly to download or execute malicious code from the server. The setup metadata appears legitimate but is likely a cover for malicious activity during install.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes obfuscated remote code execution during package installation, indicating malicious behavior intended to fetch or run external code. The suspicious URL and use of base64 decoding to hide this activity confirm malicious intent.",
