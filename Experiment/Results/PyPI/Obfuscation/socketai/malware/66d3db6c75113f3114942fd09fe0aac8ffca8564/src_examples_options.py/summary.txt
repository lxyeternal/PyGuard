  "conclusion": "The code samples analyzed show varying degrees of suspicion, from benign to potentially malicious. The scoring aligns with the observed patterns, with reports 2 and 3 indicating moderate to high concern. Slightly increasing the malware and security risk scores for report 2 would improve accuracy. Overall, the assessments are sound, and further static or dynamic analysis is recommended for reports with higher suspicion."
