{
  "purpose": "The code appears to initialize a web server, handle HTTP requests, and process user input, potentially for a web application.",
  "sources": "Reading user input from HTTP request parameters, reading environment variables, loading external modules and data files.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable functions such as eval(), exec(), system calls, network communications, or database queries.",
  "flows": "User input → server request handler → data processing functions → sensitive operations (eval, exec, system calls).",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval() or exec() on untrusted input, hardcoded credentials or tokens, unusual import of obscure modules, suspicious network connections, or obfuscated code segments.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes dependencies and handles HTTP requests. It processes input data which, if passed into eval() or exec(), could lead to code execution. No obvious hardcoded credentials are present, but the use of environment variables or dynamic code execution functions raises suspicion. The structure suggests typical web server flow, but potential risky functions should be closely inspected. No malicious network activity or backdoors are explicitly observed, but the use of eval() or similar functions on user data is a concern. No signs of obfuscated or malicious payloads detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates typical web server behavior but contains potential security risks if it evaluates or executes untrusted input. No definitive malicious intent or malware behaviors are identified, but cautious review of data handling functions is recommended.",
