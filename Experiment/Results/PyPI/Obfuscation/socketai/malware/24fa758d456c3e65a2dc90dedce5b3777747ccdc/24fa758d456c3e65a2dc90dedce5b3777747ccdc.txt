      "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with an obfuscated variable and dependencies that could be misused but show no active malicious behavior. The overall security posture is low risk, and the package appears safe for use, though the naming and dependencies should be scrutinized in broader context."

      "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious, heavily obfuscated, and employs dynamic code execution techniques characteristic of malware. It should be classified as malicious with maximum severity. The scores are justified and aligned with the detailed analysis, indicating a high probability of malicious activity and severe security risk."
