{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, but also downloads and executes an external executable, potentially malicious.",
  "sources": "URL request to download 'main.exe' from Discord CDN.",
  "sinks": "Writing to 'main.exe', renaming it to a system directory, and executing it with os.startfile.",
  "flows": "Requests content from the URL -> writes to 'main.exe' -> moves to system directory -> executes the file.",
  "anomalies": "Uses a misleading package name 'hack', downloads an executable from a suspicious external source, executes it without validation, and creates a directory with a system-like name.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical setup activities but includes malicious behaviors such as downloading an external executable from a Discord CDN link, which is often used for hosting malware. It then silently moves and executes this file in a system directory, indicating potential malware activity. The use of 'os.startfile' to run the downloaded file without user consent or validation is suspicious. The package name and keywords further suggest malicious intent. Overall, the code is designed to surreptitiously download and run external malware.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external executable from a suspicious URL, performing silent system modifications, and running the executable without user consent. It is highly likely to be malicious.",
