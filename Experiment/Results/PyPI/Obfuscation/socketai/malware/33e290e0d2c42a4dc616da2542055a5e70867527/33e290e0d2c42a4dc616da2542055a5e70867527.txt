The high malware, security risk, and obfuscation scores are justified and consistent with its actions."

The high malware score (1.0) is justified, and the security risk is severe. Variable obfuscation is present but not extreme, warranting a high obfuscation score (~0.75). Overall, the code should be considered malicious and dangerous."
