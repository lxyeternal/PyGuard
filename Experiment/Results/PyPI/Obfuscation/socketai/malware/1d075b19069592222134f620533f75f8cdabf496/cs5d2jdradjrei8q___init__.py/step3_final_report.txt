  "purpose": "Analyze the provided Python code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks, focusing on source-to-sink data flows and anomalies.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), hardcoded credentials/URLs, network communication points.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, file system modifications, environment variable access, data exfiltration points, system commands.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or user input flow into dynamic execution or network communication functions, potentially leading to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec with untrusted data, hardcoded credentials or URLs, obfuscation techniques, suspicious network activity, dynamic code constructs, inconsistent or convoluted code structure.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits obfuscation and dynamic execution, indicating potential malicious intent. Hardcoded secrets and suspicious network calls suggest data exfiltration or command-and-control behavior. Absence of such patterns or code in some reports aligns with benign assessment. The high malware (0.6), obfuscated (0.7), and security risk (0.75) scores in the most suspicious report are justified by these indicators. Benign reports show no anomalies, consistent with their low scores. Overall, the scoring aligns with the described behaviors and code features.",
  "conclusion": "The analysis confirms that the third report's high scores are justified due to obfuscation and suspicious network activity, indicating likely malicious behavior. The benign reports are correctly scored as low risk. No further adjustments are necessary; the scores are consistent with the evidence.",
