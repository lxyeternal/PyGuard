{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package that also executes a function to send environment variables to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (via os.environ), URL request to remote server (urllib.request), setup configuration parameters",
  "sinks": "Remote server URL request (potential data exfiltration), print statement of environment variables",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> URL encoding -> HTTP request to remote server; setup parameters are configured but not directly involved in malicious data flow",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function names, the URL is a ngrok address possibly used for command and control, environment variables are sent unfiltered to an external server, printing environment variables (possible information leak), the code makes network requests during package setup, which is unusual and suspicious",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools and defines functions with obfuscated names. A function is created that copies environment variables into a dictionary, prints them, encodes them, and sends them via an HTTP request to an external ngrok URL. This function is called during the installation and development commands, meaning it executes whenever the package is installed or developed. The environment variables could contain sensitive data, and their transmission to an external server indicates a potential data exfiltration attempt. The code structure and naming are suspicious, with obfuscated identifiers and an external URL that suggests control or data collection mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a potentially malicious activity by exfiltrating environment variables during package setup, which could include sensitive information. The obfuscated naming and network activity are strong indicators of malicious intent, likely for data theft or remote command control. This package should be treated with suspicion and further investigated before use.",
