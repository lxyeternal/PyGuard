{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, with added functions that perform network requests and environment variable handling, possibly for malicious data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (os.environ), data from the environment; network request to an external URL (ngrok URL)",
  "sinks": "Network request using urllib with environment data as URL parameters; printing environment variables",
  "flows": "Environment variables → URL encoding → HTTP request to external server; environment variables → print statement",
  "anomalies": "Function IRQUQVygtkULQrnwLXGKlmvpwvPAdvWb() collects environment variables and sends them to an external URL, which is suspicious. The URL appears to be a temporary ngrok address, often used in malicious activities. The code also constructs a request with environment variables but does not handle responses or errors.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools but then defines a function that collects environment variables, encodes them, and makes an HTTP request to an external ngrok URL. This function is invoked during package development or installation, which is unusual and suspicious behavior, potentially indicating data exfiltration or backdoor functionality. The code uses obfuscated function and variable names, which can be a tactic to hide malicious intent. No other suspicious code or payloads are detected, but the network activity itself is malicious in context.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains suspicious behavior: it captures environment variables and exfiltrates them to an external server during package setup, indicating potential malicious intent such as data theft or backdoor access. The rest of the code is standard package setup, but the hidden network activity is a security concern.",
