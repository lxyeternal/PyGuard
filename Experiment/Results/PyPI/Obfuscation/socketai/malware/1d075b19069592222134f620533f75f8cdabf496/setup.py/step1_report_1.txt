{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, with some additional functions that execute during installation or development setup.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables using os.environ and encodes them for transmission via URL. It constructs a URL with ngrok domain and sends environment data via a request. These occur in the function IRQUQVygtkULQrnwLXGKlmvpwvPAdvWb.",
  "sinks": "The environment data is sent via an HTTP request to an external ngrok URL, which can potentially leak environment variables or sensitive data if they contain secrets.",
  "flows": "Data from environment variables (source) is encoded and sent through an HTTP request to an external server (sink) during the execution of the functions IRQUQVygtkULQrnwLXGKlmvpwvPAdvWb() which is called during package setup or development commands.",
  "anomalies": "The function name is obfuscated and nonsensical. The code sends environment variables to an external server without any clear reason or user notification. Usage of an ngrok URL suggests potential command and control or data exfiltration activity. The code runs during package installation or development setup, which is unusual for legitimate packages.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools and defines functions that access environment variables and transmit them to an external URL. The function IRQUQVygtkULQrnwLXGKlmvpwvPAdvWb() is called during both install and develop commands, meaning data exfiltration occurs automatically during package setup. The environment variables may contain sensitive information, and the data is sent over an HTTP request to a potentially malicious server. The code structure is intentionally obfuscated with nonsensical function names, and there is no documentation or legitimate reason for such behavior. This strongly indicates malicious intent, aiming to harvest environment variables, which could include credentials or other secrets.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating environment variables during package setup and development commands, using obfuscated functions and suspicious external URL. This is likely a supply chain attack or malicious package designed to leak sensitive data. The package should be considered dangerous and avoided.",
