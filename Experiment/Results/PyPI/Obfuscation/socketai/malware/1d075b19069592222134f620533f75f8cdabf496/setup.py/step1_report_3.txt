{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be setting up a Python package with custom installation and development commands that execute a function which sends environment variables to an external URL.",
  "sources": "Environment variables accessed via os.environ, network request to an external URL with environment data encoded and sent via urllib.request",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.Request sending data to an external URL, potentially leaking environment variables",
  "flows": "Environment variables (source) are encoded and sent through an HTTP request (sink), initiated during package install/develop commands",
  "anomalies": "Function name and variable names are obfuscated; environment variables are collected and sent to an external server without any apparent user consent or validation; code executes during install/develop process which can be exploited maliciously",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools modules, then defines a function that captures all environment variables, prints them, and encodes them to be sent via an HTTP request to a specific external URL. The custom 'develop' and 'install' commands override the default behaviors and invoke this function during their execution, leading to automatic transmission of environment data whenever the package is installed or developed. The obfuscated function names and variable names suggest an attempt to conceal malicious activity. This behavior could be used for exfiltrating environment info, such as credentials or system details, to a remote server. No other suspicious or malicious code (like backdoors, cryptomining, or file manipulation) is present. The data exfiltration is a significant security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code intentionally collects environment variables and sends them to an external server during package installation or development, indicating malicious intent for data exfiltration. The obfuscation and the timing of data transmission raise serious security concerns.",
