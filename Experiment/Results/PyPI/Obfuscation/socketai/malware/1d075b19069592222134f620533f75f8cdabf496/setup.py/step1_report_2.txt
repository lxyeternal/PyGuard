{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be setting up a Python package with custom install and develop commands that perform an external network request, potentially to exfiltrate environment variables.",
  "sources": "Environment variables accessed via os.environ, URL encoding of environment variables, network request to an external server (ngrok URL).",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.Request sending data to external server, printing environment variables.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are gathered, URL-encoded, and sent via an HTTP request to an external server during package install or development setup.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function and class names, use of a suspicious ngrok URL, network request triggered during package setup, printing environment variables that could include sensitive info.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools and overrides the install and develop commands with custom classes. These classes invoke a function that captures all environment variables, prints them, and then encodes them for transmission. It constructs an HTTP request to an external server (via an ngrok URL) with the environment data, suggesting an attempt to exfiltrate potentially sensitive information during package installation or development. The obfuscated naming and the external request embedded within setup commands are suspicious and indicate malicious intent to leak data without user awareness.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains malicious behavior aimed at exfiltrating environment variables during package setup by sending them to an external server. The use of obfuscated names and the timing of the data transmission during install/develop commands strongly suggest malicious intent.",
