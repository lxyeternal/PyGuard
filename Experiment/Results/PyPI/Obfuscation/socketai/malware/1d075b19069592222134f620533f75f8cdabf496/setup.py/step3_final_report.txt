{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to exfiltrate environment variables during package installation or development setup by sending them to an external server, likely for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables via os.environ and encodes them for transmission.",
  "sinks": "The environment variables are sent via an HTTP request to an external URL, which acts as the sink for data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Source: os.environ (environment variables) -> encoding with urllib.parse.urlencode -> HTTP request to external URL (https://2edb-85-48-187-158.ngrok-free.app).",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function and variable names, execution during setup commands, use of a suspicious ngrok URL, printing environment variables, and sending data without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that collects all environment variables, encodes them, and transmits them to an external server during both install and develop commands. The function and class names are nonsensical, indicating obfuscation. The external URL is a temporary ngrok address, often associated with malicious activity. The data exfiltration occurs silently during package setup, which is unusual for legitimate packages. The code does not handle responses or errors from the network request, further suggesting malicious intent. The behavior aligns with data theft or command-and-control activities, and the obfuscation aims to conceal this activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating environment variables during package setup, using obfuscation and a suspicious external URL. This activity poses a high security risk and should be considered malicious.",
