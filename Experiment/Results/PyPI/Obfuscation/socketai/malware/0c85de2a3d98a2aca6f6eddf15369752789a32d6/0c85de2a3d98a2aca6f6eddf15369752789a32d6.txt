      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code demonstrates malicious behavior through immediate, covert system info exfiltration to a suspicious URL, with obfuscated function names. It warrants high malware and security risk scores. The activity indicates a supply chain security threat, and the package should be flagged accordingly."

      "conclusion": "The code appears benign in isolation but uses obfuscation and internal modules that could hide malicious behavior in a larger context. No active malicious activity is detected, but caution is warranted if these modules are malicious or used maliciously. The current low malware and risk scores are appropriate."

      "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign in isolation, with no evidence of malicious behavior. Obfuscation and internal module naming are noted but do not constitute malicious activity by themselves. Further review of the imported modules' content is recommended to confirm their benign nature. Overall, the code poses minimal security risk."
