  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious remote code fetch and execution command at the start, which is a strong indicator of malicious activity. The rest of the script is standard package setup code, but the initial command dominates the security assessment. The high malware and risk scores are justified and should be treated as malicious. Immediate review and removal are recommended."
