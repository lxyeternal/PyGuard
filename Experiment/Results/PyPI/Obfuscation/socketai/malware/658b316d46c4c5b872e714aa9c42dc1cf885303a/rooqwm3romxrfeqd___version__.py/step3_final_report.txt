  "purpose": "Simple static string join operation converting a tuple of integers into a dot-separated string.",
  "sources": "Tuple definition (static data), map(str, tuple)",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, no untrusted input, no data leaks",
  "flows": "Tuple -> map(str) -> join -> assign to variable",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are obfuscated, but logic is straightforward; no malicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code defines a static tuple of integers and joins their string representations with periods, resulting in '5.2.0'. No external input, no dynamic execution, no network activity, and no suspicious behavior. Variable names are obfuscated but do not impact security. All reports correctly identify the benign nature. Malware score is 0, obfuscation is minimal, and security risk is negligible. The code is a simple static string formatting operation with no vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior or security risks. Variable obfuscation is minor and does not imply malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
