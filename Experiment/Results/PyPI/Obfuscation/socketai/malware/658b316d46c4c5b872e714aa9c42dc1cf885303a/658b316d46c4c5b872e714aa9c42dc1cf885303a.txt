      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious remote code fetch and execution command at the start, which is a strong indicator of malicious activity. The rest of the script is standard package setup code, but the initial command dominates the security assessment. The high malware and risk scores are justified and should be treated as malicious. Immediate review and removal are recommended."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign, with a minor maintainability concern due to the use of 'import *'. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are justified; I recommend maintaining malware=0, obfuscated=0, and setting risk=0 to reflect the lack of security threats."

      "conclusion": "The code shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic evaluation, which are suspicious but not definitively malicious. The overall security risk remains moderate, primarily due to obfuscation and eval usage. The malware likelihood is low to moderate, with scores around 0.2-0.4. The reports' assessments are consistent with the observed features, and no immediate threat is confirmed. Further static and dynamic analysis is recommended before deployment."
