  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Confirms that the code is just an import statement with no malicious behavior.  \n- Confidence is high (1), and all scores align with the benign nature.  \n- No issues here.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Notes that 'from .core import *' can be risky due to namespace pollution and potential for hiding malicious imports.  \n- The analysis correctly states that, by itself, it's not malicious but warrants caution.  \n- The securityRisk is 0.2, which seems reasonable given the potential for misuse.  \n- Malware score is 0, consistent with the lack of evidence of malicious activity.  \n- Confidence is 0.7, reflecting some concern but no definitive malicious behavior.  \n- No changes needed.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Similar to Report 2, emphasizes that 'import *' can obscure imported symbols, which could be malicious if the core module contains malicious code.  \n- The conclusion appropriately states no evidence of malicious activity based solely on this line.  \n- Scores are consistent; malware is 0, securityRisk is 0.2, confidence is 0.6.  \n- No issues here.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Reiterates that the import is standard and not suspicious, with no anomalies or malicious indicators.  \n- Confidence is high (0.8), but malware remains 0, which is consistent.  \n- No concerns.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Confirms the import is straightforward and typical, with no signs of obfuscation or malware.  \n- Scores are aligned with a benign assessment.  \n- Confidence is 1, malware 0.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- All reports agree that the code snippet is a simple import statement with no malicious activity.\n- The use of 'import *' is flagged as a potential maintainability and security concern but not inherently malicious.\n- No evidence suggests malware, obfuscation, or security risks beyond the general caution about 'import *'.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the evidence.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** Given the cautious stance on 'import *', a small risk score of around 0.2 seems appropriate, aligning with the reports.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, with the only concern being the use of 'import *', which should be reviewed in the context of the entire codebase but does not constitute an immediate security threat.",
