  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the same line of code: `from .core import *`.\n- The code is a simple import statement, bringing in all symbols from a local module named `core`.\n- No reports indicate any actual malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code.\n- The main concern raised is the use of `import *`, which is generally discouraged due to namespace pollution and potential masking of malicious imports, but by itself, it is not malicious.\n- The reports consistently assign malware scores of 0, indicating no malware detected.\n- Security risk scores are low (mostly 0.2), reflecting the potential maintainability or clarity issues, not security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n\n- **Presence of issues in code?**  \n  No. The code is just an import statement, no executable logic, data flow, or external communication.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  The main flaw is the use of `import *`, which can be risky in larger codebases, but not an outright security flaw.\n\n- **Scores evaluation:**  \n  The malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the code. The security risk scores are low, reflecting caution about `import *` but not actual vulnerabilities.\n\n- **Risk scores justification:**  \n  Since there's no evidence of malicious activity, malware, or obfuscation, scores of 0 for malware are justified. The security risk scores are slightly higher (up to 0.2) due to maintainability concerns, which is reasonable.\n\n- **Malware claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No. The reports do not assume malicious intent; they just note the potential issues with `import *`.\n\n- **Consistency of scores:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the content and the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n\n- The core module (`core`) is not provided, so we cannot evaluate if it contains malicious code. The import line alone does not reveal malicious intent.\n- The use of `import *` is a maintainability concern but not inherently malicious.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as no obfuscation is evident.\n- **Risk score:** Given the lack of malicious indicators, a low risk score (around 0.1) is appropriate, primarily due to the use of `import *` which could hide malicious code if present in `core`.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n| Score Type      | Suggested Value | Justification                                              |\n|-----------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0                 | No malicious activity detected in the import statement.     |\n| Obfuscated      | 0                 | No obfuscation observed.                                      |\n| Security Risk   | 0.1 – 0.2         | Minor maintainability concern, but no security threat.     |\n\n**Overall, this code snippet appears benign, with the main concern being maintainability rather than security.**",
