  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with a minor maintainability concern due to the use of 'import *'. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are justified; I recommend maintaining malware=0, obfuscated=0, and setting risk=0 to reflect the lack of security threats."
