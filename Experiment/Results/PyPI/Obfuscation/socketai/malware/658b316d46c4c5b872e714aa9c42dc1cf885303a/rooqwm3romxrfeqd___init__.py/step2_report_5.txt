  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms that the code is just a simple import statement (`from .core import *`).\n- No data flow, no external communication, no anomalies.\n- Conclusion: benign, no security risk.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No issues here.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Highlights that using `import *` can obscure imported symbols, which could be risky.\n- No malicious activity observed, but practice is discouraged.\n- Confidence is 0.7; security risk is 0.2, reflecting cautious concern.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the potential for abuse exists, but none is evident here. The risk score seems appropriate, given the practice's drawbacks but no evidence of malicious intent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Similar to Report 2, notes that `import *` can conceal malicious code but finds no direct evidence.\n- Confidence slightly lower (0.6), risk at 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable. The concern about obscured symbols is valid, but no actual malicious activity is present.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Reiterates that `import *` can obscure code but finds no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- Confidence at 0.8, risk at 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous assessments.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same conclusion: standard import, no anomalies, no malicious activity.\n- Confidence at 1, risk at 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- All reports agree that the code is just a simple import statement.\n- No evidence of malicious code, data exfiltration, or obfuscation.\n- The primary concern is the use of `import *`, which can hide malicious imports if they exist in the 'core' module, but this cannot be confirmed from the snippet alone.\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports, which is appropriate; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Mostly 0 or 0.2, reflecting the potential risk of namespace pollution but no actual threat.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- Given the minimal code and no evidence of malicious activity, I would keep the scores as they are.\n- However, I would emphasize that **the main concern is the 'import *' pattern**, which should prompt review of the 'core' module to ensure it doesn't contain malicious code or obfuscation.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no evidence)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (simple import statement)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 (due to use of 'import *' but no actual malicious activity)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code snippet is benign, with a minor maintainability concern due to the use of `import *`. No changes needed to the scores based on the evidence.",
