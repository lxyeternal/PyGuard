  "purpose": "The code imports everything from a local module named 'core'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module '.core'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code only performs an import statement, so no data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative import syntax (from .core import *) is standard for package modules; no unusual code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement importing all contents from a local module named 'core'. It does not contain any executable logic, data handling, or external communication. Without additional context or code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The import is typical in Python packages, and no suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It simply includes the contents of the local 'core' module.",
