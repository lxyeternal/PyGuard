{
  "purpose": "Import all symbols from the local 'core' module, likely to utilize its functionalities within the package.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no data input or external sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code does not process or output data, nor does it perform external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only imports symbols into the namespace.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' can obscure imported symbols, potentially hiding malicious code or causing namespace pollution, but no evidence of malicious behavior is present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no executable logic, data handling, or external communication. The main concern with 'import *' is maintainability and potential for hiding malicious code, but in this isolated line, there is no indication of malicious intent. The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.2) are appropriate given the context. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are observed. The 'core' module's content remains unverified, but based solely on this line, the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with a minor maintainability concern due to the use of 'import *'. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are justified; I recommend maintaining malware=0, obfuscated=0, and setting risk=0 to reflect the lack of security threats.",
