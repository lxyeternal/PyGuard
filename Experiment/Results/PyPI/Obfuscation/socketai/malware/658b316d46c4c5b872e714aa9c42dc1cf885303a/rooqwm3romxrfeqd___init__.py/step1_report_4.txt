{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from a local module named 'core'.",
  "sources": "The import statement is a source, potentially bringing in external or internal code into this module.",
  "sinks": "No immediate sinks are present in this single line of code; however, imported functions or data could act as sinks elsewhere in the program.",
  "flows": "Imported content from '.core' could flow into this module and be executed or used later.",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'import *' is generally discouraged due to namespace pollution, but it is not inherently malicious. No other anomalies are visible.",
  "analysis": "This code simply imports all symbols from a local module named 'core'. Without additional context, this is a standard Python import statement. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security issues within this line alone. The presence of 'import *' can hide the source of functions or data used later but is not in itself suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import statement with no immediate indicators of malicious intent. The only concern might be the use of 'import *', which can obscure code origin but does not pose a security risk by itself.",
