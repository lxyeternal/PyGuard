{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for a Python package, defining package name and dependencies without executing runtime logic.",
  "sources": "The package name and the obfuscated version variable, which are assigned but not used; dependencies listed in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code only defines package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated package name and variable name; the variable is unused, possibly for obfuscation purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated identifiers, which could be used to conceal malicious intent but contains no active malicious code or data flows. The dependencies listed could be misused if the package were malicious, but in this static setup context, no malicious behavior is evident. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. Scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the benign nature of the code, with low malware risk and moderate obfuscation concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and primarily characterized by obfuscation, which warrants caution but does not constitute malicious activity. The dependency list alone does not indicate malicious behavior. Overall, the security risk is low, and the malware score should remain at 0. Obfuscation scores can be slightly higher to reflect suspicion but are not indicative of actual malicious intent.",
