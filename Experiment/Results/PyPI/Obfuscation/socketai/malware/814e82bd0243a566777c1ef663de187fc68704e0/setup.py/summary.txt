  "conclusion": "The code is benign and primarily characterized by obfuscation, which warrants caution but does not constitute malicious activity. The dependency list alone does not indicate malicious behavior. Overall, the security risk is low, and the malware score should remain at 0. Obfuscation scores can be slightly higher to reflect suspicion but are not indicative of actual malicious intent."
