{
  "purpose": "Execute a decoded command that appears to involve a cURL request to a URL.",
  "sources": "The variable YKzIwnDRnxHIKgMKOtAszGaqscKQVwlt which contains a base64-encoded string.",
  "sinks": "os.system() function that executes the decoded command in the system shell.",
  "flows": "base64.b64decode(YKzIwnDRnxHIKgMKOtAszGaqscKQVwlt) -> os.system()",
  "anomalies": "The code encodes a command in base64, which is then decoded and executed directly via os.system(). The encoded string, when decoded, is a cURL command to an external URL. This obfuscation suggests an attempt to hide malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'os' and 'base64' modules, then defines a variable containing a base64-encoded string. This string, when decoded, results in a shell command using 'curl' to access 'https://pypi.org' with parameters that include a hostname and other info. The script then executes this command via os.system(), which can be used to send data to an external server, indicating potential data exfiltration or remote command execution. The obfuscation via base64 encoding and direct execution of decoded commands is suspicious and typical of malicious or maliciously intended scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to silently execute a cURL command to an external URL, likely for data collection or command-and-control purposes. Its obfuscation and direct execution of decoded data suggest malicious intent, such as data exfiltration or remote control, rather than benign behavior.",
