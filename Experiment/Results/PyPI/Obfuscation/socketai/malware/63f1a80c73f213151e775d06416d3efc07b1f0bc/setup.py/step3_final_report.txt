  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script that reads README.md and configures package metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long_description; static parameters for setuptools.setup()",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or code execution points present",
  "flows": "Input from README.md flows into long_description parameter; no malicious data flows detected",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a non-standard, random key 'qlTOfZZmSzpGLLsLMhBAsEypedlOhLZW' with a nested dictionary, which is not a recognized setuptools parameter",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with a suspicious, non-standard key that does not impact functionality but could be obfuscated or placeholder data. No code injection, network activity, or malicious behavior is evident. The anomalous key is consistent across multiple reports and is likely a typo, placeholder, or obfuscation. Scores assigned in reports are generally appropriate; malware score remains at 0, obfuscation is moderate (~0.2-0.7), and security risk is low to moderate (~0.1-0.45). The key's presence warrants further review but does not constitute active malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script appears benign with an anomalous, suspicious key that is unlikely to be malicious. No evidence of supply chain attack or malware is present. The risk is low, but the anomalous key should be investigated further to confirm its purpose.",
