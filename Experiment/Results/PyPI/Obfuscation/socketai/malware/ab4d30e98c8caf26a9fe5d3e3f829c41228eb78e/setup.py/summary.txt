  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious intent due to silent, obfuscated PowerShell command execution during package setup. The obfuscation, stealth, and error suppression are typical of malicious payloads aiming to evade detection. Scores of approximately 0.8 for malware and risk, and 0.9 for obfuscation, are justified based on the observed behavior. Further decoding of the PowerShell command is recommended to confirm payload intent, but current evidence suggests a high likelihood of malicious activity."
