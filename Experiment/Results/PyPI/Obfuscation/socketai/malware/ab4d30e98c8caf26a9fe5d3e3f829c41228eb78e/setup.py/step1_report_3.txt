  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, with an embedded attempt to execute a hidden PowerShell command.",
  "sources": "Reading 'os.path.exists' and the 'subprocess.Popen' call with encoded PowerShell command.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.Popen executing the encoded PowerShell command, which could perform malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Check if 'tahg' directory exists -> if not, execute PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen.",
  "anomalies": "Use of encoded PowerShell command with 'powershell -EncodedCommand', executed without user consent, and the command is obfuscated. The code is designed to run silently in the background, which is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports distutils.setup for package setup. It then attempts to check for the existence of a directory 'tahg'. If absent, it executes a hidden PowerShell command encoded in base64. The command is executed asynchronously with no window, indicating potential malicious intent to run hidden or stealth operations. The setup call is standard, but the embedded PowerShell invocation is suspicious, as it is obfuscated and executed without user interaction. The overall structure suggests the script may attempt to run malicious PowerShell code silently during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a hidden, obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently, which is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It appears designed to run potentially harmful commands in the background during package setup, which is suspicious and potentially malicious.",
