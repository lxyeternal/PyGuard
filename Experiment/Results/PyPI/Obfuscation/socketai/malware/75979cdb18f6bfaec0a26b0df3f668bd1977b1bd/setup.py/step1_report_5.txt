  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package, configuring dependencies and package metadata.",
  "sources": "File I/O operation when reading './README.md' to obtain long_description.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that process untrusted input data or perform dangerous actions.",
  "flows": "Reading the README file (source) and using data in setup configuration (sink).",
  "anomalies": "The variable names are obfuscated or nonsensical, such as 'EJLRvAnbESCUgRvZRuZYNhicpXJexewj' and 'VANXnJXOpOFnArFdkZzjDzSQjtNEpMMS'. These variables are used to store dependency lists and configuration data, which is unusual and suggests obfuscation. The code also concatenates lists with unusual variable names, but these operations are standard list operations, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical Python setup configuration, importing 'setuptools' and reading a README file for long description. The variable names are intentionally obfuscated, but the structure follows normal setup.py conventions. There are no suspicious network calls, dynamic code execution, or hardcoded credentials. The dependencies listed are standard and do not indicate malicious behavior. The obfuscation appears to be an attempt to hide variable names but does not contribute to malicious functionality. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate setup script with obfuscated variable names but no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, with obfuscated variable names that do not indicate malicious behavior. There are no signs of malware or security risks present. The obfuscation is unusual but not malicious. Overall security risk is low.",
