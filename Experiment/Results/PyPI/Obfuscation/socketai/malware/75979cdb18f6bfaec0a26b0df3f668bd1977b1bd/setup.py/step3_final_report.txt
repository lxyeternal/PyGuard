{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for a Python package, defining dependencies, metadata, and reading a README file for description.",
  "sources": "Static data definitions, dependency lists, and file reading (README.md). No untrusted input handling.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform harmful actions; no network or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "N/A – static configuration without dynamic data flow or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of variable names (e.g., 'EJLRvAnbESCUgRvZRuZYNhicpXJexewj'), which is unusual for setup scripts and could be an attempt at concealment.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with dependencies and metadata, but the variable names are intentionally obfuscated. No malicious code, network activity, or data exfiltration is present. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not constitute malicious behavior. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code, assigning a malware score of 0. The obfuscation scores (~0.75) are justified given the variable naming. The security risk score (~0.2) is appropriate, reflecting low threat level. No evidence suggests malicious intent or activity; the obfuscation is likely superficial.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with obfuscated variable names. Despite the suspicious naming, there is no evidence of malicious activity, malware, or malicious intent. The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not elevate the security risk significantly. The scores across reports are consistent and appropriate.",
