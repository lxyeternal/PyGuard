{
  "purpose": "The script is setting up a Python package distribution, defining dependencies, metadata, and package information.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file; defining dependency lists; setting package metadata",
  "sinks": "None observed that process untrusted data or user input; no data leaks or insecure actions are evident",
  "flows": "Reading README.md -> setting up package metadata and dependencies; no untrusted data flow identified",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names that do not serve a descriptive purpose; no clear malicious intent but unusual variable naming; no suspicious code execution, code injection, or hidden behaviors",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs package setup using setuptools with structured dependency lists and metadata. Obfuscated variable names such as 'EJLRvAnbESCUgRvZRuZYNhicpXJexewj' and 'VANXnJXOpOFnArFdkZzjDzSQjtNEpMMS=' are unusual and may hinder readability but do not inherently indicate malicious behavior. The script reads the README.md file and defines dependencies and package info, all typical for a setup script. No dynamic code execution, network communication, or credential handling is present. The unusual variable names are likely an attempt to obfuscate or complicate the code but do not execute any harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with obfuscated variable names. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malware. The obfuscation appears superficial, possibly for code protection or concealment, but it does not introduce security risks.",
