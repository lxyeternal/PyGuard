  "purpose": "Assess the supply chain security of the open source dependency by analyzing code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code input, data reading functions, network communication points, environment variable access, input validation routines.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission functions, file write operations, environment variable usage, database queries, system commands.",
  "flows": "Data read from sources (inputs, environment, network) passing through processing functions to sinks (network, files, system).",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, suspicious network domains, obfuscated code, use of eval/exec, unusual variable naming, hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code shows no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, suspicious network connections, or backdoors. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present. Input validation appears standard, with no hardcoded secrets or insecure code practices. The code structure is straightforward, with no unusual control flows or dynamic code execution. The security risk is minimal, and malware likelihood is negligible. Confidence in benign assessment is high due to lack of suspicious signals.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency code appears benign with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk score (0.2) is justified, and malware likelihood is zero. The overall security posture is acceptable, with minor concerns about input validation that do not constitute active threats.",
