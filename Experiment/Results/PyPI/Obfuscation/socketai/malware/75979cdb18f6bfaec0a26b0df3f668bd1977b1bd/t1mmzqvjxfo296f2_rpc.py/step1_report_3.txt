  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a specific data processing task, possibly involving network communication or data manipulation.",
  "sources": "Data is read from environment variables, user inputs, or external files. Specific functions may load data from network sources or local files.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network transmission functions, file writes, or execution of dynamic code. These are points where untrusted data could cause harm or leaks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or user input through processing functions, potentially reaching sinks like network senders, file writers, or eval/exec functions.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or malicious code patterns are detected. The code uses standard libraries without obfuscation or misleading variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes common Python modules, handles data input/output in typical ways, and does not contain obfuscated constructs. There are no signs of malicious payloads such as network exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors. The structure indicates standard data processing without suspicious behavior. No dangerous use of eval or exec is observed. Environment variables are used in a typical manner without sensitive hardcoded secrets. Overall, the code appears benign and purpose-driven without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code does not exhibit signs of malware or malicious activity. It appears to be a legitimate data processing script with no immediate security concerns.",
