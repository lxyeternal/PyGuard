{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define various constants, parameters, and configuration values potentially for blockchain or cryptographic applications.",
  "sources": "Constants assigned directly in the code, including environment-like variables, string literals, and numeric values.",
  "sinks": "There are no clear sinks or data flows leading to data leak, system modification, or external communication.",
  "flows": "No evident flow from input sources to sinks; mostly static assignments.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of multiple hard-coded large numeric values, cryptographic-like constants, and multiple blockchain-related string identifiers for forks. No functions or dynamic behavior present. No obfuscated code or runtime data manipulation. No use of external inputs, network calls, or file I/O.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of constant definitions, likely for a blockchain environment, including fork identifiers, cryptographic parameters, and network parameters. All data are statically assigned; there are no functions, control flow, or data manipulations indicating malicious intent. The constants and variable names suggest configuration or setup for a blockchain client or smart contract system. No suspicious behaviors such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code injection are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code consists solely of static constant definitions with no active behavior or dynamic data processing. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or malicious intent. The presence of blockchain-related constants appears to be legitimate configuration data for a blockchain system. Overall, the code poses no security risks or malware threat.",
