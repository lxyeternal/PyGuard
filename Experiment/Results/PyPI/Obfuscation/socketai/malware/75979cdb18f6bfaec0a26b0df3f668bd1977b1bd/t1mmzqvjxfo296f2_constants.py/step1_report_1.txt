{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define various constants, configuration parameters, and network or blockchain-related settings, likely for a blockchain or cryptocurrency application.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded string literals, numeric constants, and sets of predefined strings which seem to represent network forks, transaction states, or other configuration values.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit data sinks or functions that process untrusted input; the code only defines constants and sets. No functions, I/O, or external data handling observed.",
  "flows": "The code simply assigns constant values and creates sets, with no data flow from input to output or between variables; no flow analysis is applicable beyond static definitions.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains numerous hardcoded cryptographic parameters, network forks, and blockchain-specific constants. No obfuscated code or suspicious constructs are evident. No credentials, backdoors, or unusual behavior are detected. The constants themselves are typical for blockchain projects, not suspicious. No malicious code, network connections, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "analysis": "The script consists solely of variable assignments, set definitions, and string constants that appear to configure a blockchain or Ethereum-like environment. No functions, data processing, or external interactions are present. The constants align with common blockchain parameters such as fork names, block gas limits, chain IDs, and specific addresses. There is no indication of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malware. The structure is straightforward and purely definitional. No security risks or malicious signals are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration module defining constants and network parameters related to a blockchain environment. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. It appears to serve as a configuration or constants file for a blockchain client or application.",
