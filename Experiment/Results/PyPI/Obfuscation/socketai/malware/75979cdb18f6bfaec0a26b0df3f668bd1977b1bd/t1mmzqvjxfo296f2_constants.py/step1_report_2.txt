{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a series of constants, likely related to blockchain or cryptocurrency operations, such as block numbers, fork identifiers, transaction states, and cryptographic parameters.",
  "sources": "No dynamic input sources; all data are hardcoded constants and string literals.",
  "sinks": "No data is written to external systems, network, or files; no sinks identified.",
  "flows": "No data flows or data processing paths involving untrusted input are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code is heavily filled with hardcoded cryptographic parameters, fork names, and large constants. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious variable usage is apparent. The constants relate to known blockchain parameters but are static and do not by themselves indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of constant definitions, including large numerical values, string literals representing blockchain forks, and some cryptographic parameters (e.g., secp256k1 order, Ethereum chain IDs). It does not contain functions, dynamic code execution, network activity, or input/output operations. The absence of runtime logic, input handling, or data transmission indicates no immediate security concerns or malicious behavior. The constants are consistent with blockchain-related data, but their static nature suggests no malicious modification or sabotage. The code appears to be a configuration or constants module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static set of constant definitions related to blockchain or cryptocurrency parameters, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain dynamic or obfuscated code, backdoors, or data leaks. No vulnerabilities are identifiable based on the provided code snippet.",
