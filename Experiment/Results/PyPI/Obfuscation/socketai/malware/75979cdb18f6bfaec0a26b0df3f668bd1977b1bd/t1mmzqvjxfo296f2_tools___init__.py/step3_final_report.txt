  "purpose": "The code appears to perform data processing with no evident malicious intent or suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Reads from environment variables, function parameters, and external modules/files.",
  "sinks": "Potentially network, file writes, or data transmission points, but no evidence of untrusted data flow.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks through processing functions; specific paths are not detailed.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The confidence in benign assessment is moderate due to limited context. No suspicious patterns or malicious indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no malicious activity detected. The scores reflect the lack of suspicious patterns, with low malware and obfuscation scores and low security risk. The confidence level is moderate, consistent with the limited code snippet.",
