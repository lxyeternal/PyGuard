  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data handling or external system interaction",
  "flows": "Import modules -> check Python version -> retrieve package version",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and module names, but no malicious behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup tasks with obfuscated identifiers. No network activity, data leaks, or code execution is present. The obfuscation may be stylistic or for internal purposes but does not indicate malicious intent. The version check enforces Python 3 compatibility. All signals point to benign behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package initialization script with obfuscated names but no malicious or security-threatening behavior. The low malware and risk scores are appropriate; obfuscation is noted but not malicious.",
