{
  "purpose": "Define multiple custom exception classes with obfuscated names, likely for error handling within a larger application.",
  "sources": "No explicit input sources; no data reading or external input in this code fragment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data output, network communication, or data leakage mechanisms present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; this code only defines exception classes without active data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Exception class names are heavily obfuscated and do not follow descriptive naming conventions, which can be suspicious. No other unusual behaviors or hidden code present.",
  "analysis": "The code only defines several custom exception classes with obfuscated names. There are no functions, logic, or data processing. Obfuscated class names can be a tactic to conceal malicious intent or simply to hinder analysis, but in this isolated context, it appears as code obfuscation rather than malicious behavior. No signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, network access, or code injection are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists solely of obfuscated exception class definitions with no active malicious behavior or security risks detected. The obfuscation may be suspicious but is not inherently malicious based on this snippet alone.",
