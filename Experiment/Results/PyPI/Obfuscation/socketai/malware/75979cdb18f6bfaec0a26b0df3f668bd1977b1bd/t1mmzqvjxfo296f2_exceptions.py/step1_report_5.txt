{
  "purpose": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes in Python, likely intended for use in larger programs to handle specific error conditions.",
  "sources": "Class definitions that create exception objects, which may be raised or caught elsewhere in the codebase.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; the code does not process untrusted data, nor does it perform I/O or network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; the code only defines classes.",
  "anomalies": "The class names are obfuscated and do not indicate meaningful error handling or domain-specific purposes. The class names are random strings, which may be used to hide malicious intent or obscure code purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, each with a name that appears to be randomly generated or obfuscated. There are no functions, data processing, or external interactions. While obfuscation alone does not imply malicious intent, the naming pattern and lack of descriptive identifiers could suggest concealment. No evidence of code injection, data leaks, or network activity is present within this fragment. Since no malicious behavior or harmful operations are visible, this code appears benign in isolation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is limited to defining obfuscated custom exception classes with no active logic, data handling, or external interactions. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks in this isolated context. However, the obfuscated names warrant cautious review within the broader codebase to ensure they are used appropriately.",
