{
  "purpose": "The code defines multiple heavily obfuscated custom exception classes inheriting from Exception, with no operational logic or data handling.",
  "sources": "Class definitions with obfuscated class names; no input, data reading, or external data sources present.",
  "sinks": "No data flows or untrusted data handling; no sinks such as network transmission or file writing are present.",
  "flows": "None; the code only declares classes without execution or data movement.",
  "anomalies": "Heavily obfuscated class names, which could be suspicious but are not inherently malicious; absence of logic or data processing.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class declarations for custom exceptions with obfuscated names, lacking any functions, data flows, or external interactions. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not demonstrate malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code, noting the obfuscation but emphasizing that it alone does not imply malware. Scores assigned (malware=0, high obfuscation score ~0.8-0.9, low security risk ~0.2) are consistent with the analysis. No evidence of malicious behavior or active security threats is present in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of obfuscated custom exception classes with no malicious activity detected. While obfuscation warrants caution, it does not constitute malware in this context. The current scores are appropriate and consistent; no modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
