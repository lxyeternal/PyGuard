{
  "purpose": "Define multiple custom exception classes with obfuscated names for use in larger Python codebases.",
  "sources": "Class definitions that create custom Exception subclasses without any data input or external data reading.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no data handling, network operations, or untrusted input usage present.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink flows; the code solely defines classes without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "The class names are heavily obfuscated, which can be suspicious, but such obfuscation alone is not malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from Exception, with obfuscated class names. There are no functions, data processing, or external interactions. The purpose appears to be to create custom exception types, but the obfuscation may be used to hide malicious intent. However, without other context, this is not conclusive.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of obfuscated custom exception class definitions with no malicious behavior detected. The obfuscation may be suspicious but is not sufficient evidence of malware. It does not appear to perform any harmful actions or contain malicious intent.",
