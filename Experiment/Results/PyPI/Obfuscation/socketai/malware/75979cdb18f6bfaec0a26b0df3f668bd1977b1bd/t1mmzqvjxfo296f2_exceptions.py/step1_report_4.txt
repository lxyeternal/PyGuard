  "purpose": "Define multiple custom exception classes with obfuscated names.",
  "sources": "No explicit input or data reading; class definitions are static.",
  "targets": "No untrusted data handling or output; no sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink pathways observed.",
  "anomalies": "Class names are highly obfuscated, resembling random strings, with no meaningful identifiers. No actual code logic, data handling, or behavior is present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of multiple custom exception class definitions, all named with long, random strings. These classes inherit from Python's built-in Exception class. There are no methods, data manipulations, or behaviors. The obfuscated class names may be intended to conceal their purpose or hinder analysis, but no malicious actions or suspicious activities are evident. The code appears as a static declaration of exceptions without any operational logic or interaction.",
  "conclusion": "The code defines obfuscated exception classes but contains no active logic, data handling, or potential security risks. It appears as an obfuscation or placeholder rather than malicious code or malware. No security threats or malicious behaviors are detectable based on the provided snippet.",
