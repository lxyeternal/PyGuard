{
  "purpose": "Define multiple custom exception classes with obfuscated names.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data, only class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; purely class declarations.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class names suggest an attempt to conceal intent; no meaningful logic or behavior, only exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from Exception, with intentionally obfuscated class names. There are no data inputs, external communications, or other behaviors. The lack of comments and meaningful identifiers could be an attempt to hide malicious intent, but as it stands, this code simply defines custom exceptions without any operational logic. The obfuscation alone does not indicate malicious behavior, but it warrants caution due to the unusual naming scheme.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign in functionality—just defining obfuscated exception classes. However, the obfuscated class names may indicate an attempt to conceal malicious activity elsewhere. Based solely on this snippet, no malicious behavior is evident, but the obfuscation warrants further review of the entire package.",
