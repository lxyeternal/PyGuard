{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be a Python setup script for a package named 'infoglmi', but it also includes code that downloads and executes a remote file, indicating potential malicious activity.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the URL 'https://github-bebra.s3.filebase.com/node' via requests.get(). It also interacts with the filesystem (/tmp/node and /tmp/config.json) and executes a file ('./node').",
  "sinks": "The content downloaded from the URL is written directly to '/tmp/node' and then executed with 'system'. The code also writes an empty config.json file.",
  "flows": "The flow is: requests.get() fetches remote content -> writes to /tmp/node -> sets executable permissions -> executes /tmp/node via system()",
  "anomalies": "The code downloads a file from a suspicious URL and executes it without validation, which is highly unusual and potentially malicious. The empty write to 'config.json' and the obfuscated function name further suggest malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script imports modules 'setuptools', 'system' from 'os', and 'get' from 'requests'. It defines a function with an obfuscated name that, when called, fetches a file from a suspicious URL and executes it locally. The download and execution of external code without validation pose significant security risks. The rest of the script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package, which appears legitimate but is likely masking malicious activity within the same file.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior, notably downloading and executing remote code from an untrusted source, which is a serious security concern. The presence of this activity suggests the package could be used as a supply chain attack vector or to run malicious code on systems where it is installed.",
