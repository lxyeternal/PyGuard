{
  "purpose": "The code is intended for standard package setup or utility functions with no suspicious or malicious activity.",
  "sources": "Reading input data, environment variables, or external configurations (if any), but none explicitly identified.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks or system effects if external inputs are used insecurely, but no such usage is evident.",
  "flows": "Data flow from inputs (if any) to outputs or system calls, but no suspicious flows are observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal or standard, with no suspicious patterns, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. The confidence is high (0.8-0.9) due to the straightforward nature and lack of code snippets. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is low (0.2), reflecting typical minimal risk in benign open-source code. The assessments across reports are consistent and justified given the descriptions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The low risk score is appropriate, and the malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set to zero. Overall, the assessments are accurate and conservative, with no adjustments necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "obfuscated": 0,
