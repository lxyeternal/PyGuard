{
  "purpose": "Define and configure the installation requirements for a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The package name, dependencies specified in 'install_requires', version, and license fields.",
  "sinks": "Potentially none directly, but dependencies can be used maliciously if compromised.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks within this code snippet; dependencies are specified but not used directly.",
  "anomalies": "Dependencies include 'pywin32', 'pyscreeze', 'pynput', and 'WMI' — some of which interact with system-level features and hardware. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code uses setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. The dependencies involve Windows system libraries ('pywin32', 'WMI') and input/output libraries ('pyscreeze', 'pynput'), which could be used for system monitoring or automation. There is no malicious code, backdoor, or suspicious behavior evident in this configuration. The package name appears generic and does not suggest malicious intent. No obfuscation, code execution, or data leakage mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely sets up package requirements and metadata. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or supply chain attack vectors. The dependencies, while powerful, are standard for Windows automation or monitoring tools and do not indicate malicious behavior by themselves.",
