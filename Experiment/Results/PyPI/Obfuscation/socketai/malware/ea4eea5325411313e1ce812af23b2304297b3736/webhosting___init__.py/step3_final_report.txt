{
  "purpose": "The code imports all functions, classes, or variables from the 'webhosting.discord' module, likely to utilize its features.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself is the source; no other data sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include any functions or variables imported that could handle untrusted data or perform sensitive operations, but none are specified here.",
  "flows": "No data flows are observable from this single import statement alone.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('*') from a module with a suspicious name ('webhosting.discord') is anomalous and can hide malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a wildcard import from a module named 'webhosting.discord'. This pattern is discouraged due to obscurity and potential for hiding malicious functions. The module name suggests a connection to Discord, which could be exploited for malicious purposes, but no further code or context is provided. The import alone does not demonstrate malicious behavior; however, the naming and import style warrant caution. Scores reflect suspicion but lack concrete evidence of malicious activity. Further investigation into the module's contents is recommended to confirm safety.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is suspicious due to the wildcard usage and module naming but does not confirm malicious activity. The risk is moderate, and further analysis of the module is advised to ensure security.",
