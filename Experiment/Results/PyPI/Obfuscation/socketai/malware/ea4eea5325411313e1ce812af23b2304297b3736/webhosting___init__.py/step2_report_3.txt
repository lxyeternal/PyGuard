  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, scores, and underlying assumptions.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports focus on a single import statement: `from webhosting.discord import *`.\n- The import statement is broad (wildcard), which is generally discouraged due to obscurity.\n- The module name `webhosting.discord` is suspicious because it combines \"webhosting\" and \"discord,\" which could be benign or malicious depending on context.\n- No additional code is provided, so the actual behavior of the imported module cannot be assessed.\n- The malware scores across reports are generally low (0.3 or 0), but some reports suggest potential risks.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 1**\n\n- **Purpose:** Import all functions, classes, or variables from `webhosting.discord`.\n- **Malware score:** 0.3\n- **Analysis:** The reasoning is that the wildcard import from an obscure module could be malicious. This is plausible, but without further code, it's speculative.\n- **Risk justification:** A malware score of 0.3 suggests some concern but not high risk; this seems reasonable given the context.\n- **Verdict:** The score is acceptable; the concern is about obscurity and potential malicious intent, but not confirmed.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 2**\n\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Analysis:** The report dismisses the risk, stating that the import alone does not indicate malicious intent.\n- **Justification:** This is reasonable; an import statement alone is not malicious.\n- **Score assessment:** Given the minimal code, malware score of 0 is justified.\n- **Verdict:** The score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 3**\n\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Analysis:** Similar reasoning; no evidence of malicious activity from a single import.\n- **Score assessment:** Correct.\n- **Verdict:** Acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 4**\n\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Analysis:** No evidence of malicious activity, only suspicion due to wildcard import.\n- **Score assessment:** Reasonable.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 5**\n\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Analysis:** Again, no direct evidence of malicious activity; module name is suspicious but not proof.\n- **Score assessment:** Correct.\n- **Verdict:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Findings:**\n\n- The main concern revolves around the use of a wildcard import from a module with an potentially suspicious name.\n- No code beyond the import is provided, so any claims about malicious behavior are speculative.\n- The malware scores vary from 0 to 0.3, which is appropriate given the evidence.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n\n- The scores assigned seem reasonable, reflecting the uncertainty and potential risk.\n- The higher malware score (0.3) in the first report is justified because it explicitly flags suspicion based on the module name and import pattern.\n- The other reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, emphasizing that the import alone isn't evidence of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** I would assign a **0.2** to **0.3** overall, leaning towards **0.2**, considering the suspicious module name and wildcard import but no concrete malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** Given the uncertainty, a **0.2** to **0.3** seems justified; I would suggest **0.2** as a balanced estimate.\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\n| Score Type      | My Estimate      |\n|-----------------|------------------|\n| Malware Score   | **0.2**          |\n| Obfuscated Score| **0**            |\n| Risk Score      | **0.2**          |\n\nThe import statement alone warrants caution but does not constitute confirmed malicious activity. Further investigation into the actual `webhosting.discord` module is necessary to determine if it contains malicious code or backdoors.",
