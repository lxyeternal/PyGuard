  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, assessing the reasoning, and evaluating the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports focus solely on a single import statement: `from webhosting.discord import *`.\n- The code snippet contains only this import, with no subsequent code or context.\n- The module name `webhosting.discord` is suspicious because it suggests interaction with Discord, and the use of a wildcard import can hide malicious content.\n- The malware scores across reports are mostly low (0 to 0.3), and the security risks are similarly low, reflecting the limited context.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Issue presence:** The import statement is present as described.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes that wildcard import can be suspicious, especially if the module is malicious or obscure.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriately flags the broad import as suspicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0.3, securityRisk 0.4 seem reasonable given the suspicion but lack concrete evidence.\n- **Justification for risk:** The suspicion is justified due to the broad import and potentially malicious module name, even without concrete evidence.\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning is sound; the scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same import statement.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly states that the import alone does not indicate malicious activity but flags the wildcard as poor practice.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriately cautious but not alarmist.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, securityRisk 0.2 — reasonable, given no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Justification:** No concrete signs of malware; the risk is mainly due to coding practice.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and balanced.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same import.\n- **Analysis:** Similar to previous, notes that wildcard import can hide malicious code but no evidence here.\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly flags the wildcard import as suspicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, securityRisk 0.3 — acceptable.\n- **Justification:** No actual malicious activity detected; just a cautionary note.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same import.\n- **Analysis:** Recognizes that the import alone does not demonstrate malicious activity but flags the use of `import *` as suspicious.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate caution.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, securityRisk 0.2 — aligned with the reasoning.\n- **Justification:** No evidence of malicious behavior, only suspicion based on import style.\n\n**Verdict:** Sound reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same import.\n- **Analysis:** States that the import alone does not demonstrate malicious behavior but notes the module name's potential for suspicion.\n- **Conclusion:** No evidence of malicious activity, but module name warrants caution.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, securityRisk 0.2 — consistent.\n- **Justification:** No actual malicious activity, just cautious suspicion.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Code correctness:** All reports correctly identify the import statement.\n- **Logical flaws:** None of the reports make unwarranted claims; they all acknowledge the lack of further context.\n- **Scores:** All are appropriately low, reflecting the absence of concrete evidence.\n- **Malware score justification:** Given the minimal code and no evidence of malicious activity, malware scores should remain low (around 0 to 0.2). The original scores are reasonable.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All zero, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly higher than malware, reflecting potential concern due to the module name and import style, which is justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- **My estimated scores:**\n  - **Malware:** 0.1 — very low, as there's no evidence.\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n  - **Risk:** 0.2 — moderate due to the wildcard import and suspicious module name, but no concrete evidence.\n\n- **Additional notes:** To improve security posture, further investigation should examine the contents of `webhosting.discord` if accessible, especially given the wildcard import.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are consistent and cautious, appropriately flagging the import as suspicious but not malicious. The scores are reasonable, and the reasoning is sound. No significant flaws are detected.",
