  "purpose": "Import all contents from the webhosting.discord module",
  "sources": "Import statement from webhosting.discord",
  "sinks": "None explicitly shown in the provided snippet",
  "flows": "Not enough information; the snippet only shows an import statement",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('*') which can conceal malicious or unintended code, and lack of visibility into what is imported",
  "analysis": "The code only contains an import statement importing everything from the module webhosting.discord. This pattern obscures what functions, classes, or data are brought into the namespace, which can hide malicious or unintended behavior. Without additional context or code, it is impossible to determine if the imported module performs malicious actions or contains malicious code. The use of wildcard import is considered a bad practice, especially in security-sensitive contexts, as it can introduce hidden or malicious code without explicit acknowledgment.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet alone is minimal but suspicious due to the use of a wildcard import. It warrants further inspection of the 'webhosting.discord' module to rule out malicious behavior or security risks.",
