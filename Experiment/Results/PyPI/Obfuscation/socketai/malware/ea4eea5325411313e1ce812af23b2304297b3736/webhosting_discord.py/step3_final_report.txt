{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a malicious info-stealer designed to extract user credentials, tokens, cookies, system information, and application data from browsers, wallets, and other applications. It decrypts stored data, collects system info, and exfiltrates the information via web requests, Discord webhooks, and file uploads. It also terminates security or related processes to evade detection.",
  "sources": "The code reads from environment variables (e.g., LOCALAPPDATA, APPDATA, TEMP), local browser storage files (e.g., Login Data, Cookies, Local State), wallet files, application directories (e.g., Steam, Riot, Riot Client), and network responses (IP, geolocation, Discord API). It also processes encrypted data stored in local files and in-memory variables.",
  "sinks": "Data is exfiltrated through HTTP POST requests, Discord webhooks, and file uploads to third-party services like gofile.io. It also executes process termination commands to kill browsers, wallets, and other applications, and zips logs and databases for exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (local files, environment variables, network responses) into in-memory variables, where it is decrypted or processed. The data then moves via network requests or file uploads to external servers or Discord channels. Multiple threads handle concurrent data collection, process termination, and file zipping, culminating in exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "The code employs heavy obfuscation, including base64-encoded URLs, encrypted data, dynamic module installation, and complex threading. It decrypts stored credentials using Windows APIs, terminates processes to evade detection, and uses dynamically decoded URLs for communication. The presence of base64 URLs and encrypted strings indicates deliberate concealment of malicious activities.",
  "analysis": "The code is a sophisticated malware designed for credential theft, data exfiltration, and system sabotage. It decrypts stored passwords, cookies, and tokens, collects system and application data, and exfiltrates via web requests and Discord webhooks. It employs obfuscation techniques such as base64 encoding, encrypted URLs, and dynamic module installation to evade detection. Process termination routines are used to disable security measures. The extensive use of threading and encryption routines further indicates malicious intent. The code's behavior aligns with known info-stealer malware, with multiple channels for data exfiltration and active measures to prevent detection.",
  "conclusion": "The code is definitively malicious, functioning as a comprehensive info-stealer targeting Windows environments. It decrypts and exfiltrates sensitive user data, terminates security processes, and employs obfuscation to evade detection. The activity is consistent with malware designed for privacy invasion, credential theft, and system compromise. The high scores assigned in the reports (malware = 1, obfuscated = 0.85, security risk = 1) are justified and accurate.",
