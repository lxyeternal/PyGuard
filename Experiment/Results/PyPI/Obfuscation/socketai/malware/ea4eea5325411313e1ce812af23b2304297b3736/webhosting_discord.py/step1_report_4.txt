{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for data extraction, information theft (including tokens, passwords, cookies, browser data), and exfiltration via Discord webhooks. It also includes modules for file collection, encryption/decryption, and process termination, indicating malicious intent related to espionage or system compromise.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables (e.g., 'LOCALAPPDATA', 'APPDATA', 'TEMP'), file reads from browser storage, local system files, and network requests (e.g., API calls to get IP, geolocation, Discord API endpoints, and file uploads). It also reads user data files like 'save.dat', 'Cookies', 'Local State', and other browser or app data.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network requests to external URLs (e.g., web hosts, Gofile.io, Discord webhook URLs), file uploads, reading local system files containing sensitive data (tokens, passwords, cookies), and process termination commands for applications (e.g., browsers, Steam). The code also writes data to temporary files and uploads them, indicating exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Data flows from system data sources (local files, environment variables, browser/local app storage) to collection routines, where data is encrypted/decrypted and then sent to external servers via network requests or uploaded to file hosting services. Some functions also terminate processes before collecting data, implying sabotage or cleanup post-exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "Highly suspicious patterns include: base64-encoded URLs and API keys, dynamic module installations, extensive use of threading for concurrent data collection, obfuscation of URLs and variable names, the use of hardcoded webhook URLs, multiple functions for browser and app data exfiltration, and code fragments that perform process killing. The code also dynamically decodes and decrypts stored data, which is typical in malware to evade detection. Additionally, some variable names and code structure suggest obfuscation or attempt to hide malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by importing numerous modules, some of which are installed dynamically, indicating potential obfuscation or stealth. It then collects system information such as IP address and geolocation, likely for targeting or identification. The code contains functions for decrypting stored data (AES encryption with Windows-specific encryption keys), which are used to extract sensitive data like browser passwords, cookies, and tokens. It interacts with multiple Discord APIs to retrieve user relationships, billing info, and user profile data, then formats and sends this data via webhooks. There are routines for collecting files from browsers, cryptocurrency wallets, gaming applications, and messaging apps, all of which are then packaged and uploaded to file hosting services. The code performs process termination for security or cleanup purposes after data exfiltration, indicating malicious intent to avoid detection or interference. The code's overall structure, combined with encrypted URL strings, obfuscated variables, and concurrent threading for data collection, strongly suggests a malware designed for espionage, credential theft, and data exfiltration with minimal detection risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, functioning as a data-stealer targeting browser credentials, cookies, tokens, wallet information, and other sensitive files. It exfiltrates data through Discord webhooks and file uploads, terminates processes to avoid detection, and employs obfuscation techniques. Its behavior aligns with malware aimed at system compromise, privacy invasion, and credential theft. The overall security risk score is high, with a malware score indicating likely malicious activity.",
