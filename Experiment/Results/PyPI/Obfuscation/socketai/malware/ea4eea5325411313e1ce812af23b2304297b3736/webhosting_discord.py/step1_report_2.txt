{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a malicious script designed for stealing user data such as cookies, passwords, login information, and files from various browsers, applications, and games. It exfiltrates this data to a remote server and uploads files to a file hosting service, primarily targeting Windows environments.",
  "sources": "Reads user input from environment variables, reads files from browser, application, and game directories (e.g., Chrome, Opera, Steam, Riot, Discord, Telegram), reads local database files, local State files, and in-memory data via threading. It also accesses environment variables like 'TEMP', 'APPDATA', 'LOCALAPPDATA'.",
  "sinks": "Uploads collected data and files to remote URLs via requests and Discord webhook, including base64-decoded encrypted data. It also executes external processes, kills processes, copies and zips files, and uploads files to external servers (gofile.io). It writes to temp files, and triggers requests to exfiltrate data.",
  "flows": "Source data (browser, application files, environment variables, in-memory data) is collected and processed (including decryption). Data flows into request payloads and files are uploaded or sent via webhooks. Threads handle parallel operations like file collection, decryption, and uploading. The code also kills processes related to certain applications before archiving and uploading data.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded base64-encoded URLs, environment variables, and obfuscated code sections. The code includes functions for decrypting data, collecting browser and application data, and exfiltration. It references specific filenames, directories, and process names associated with popular applications (e.g., Chrome, Steam, Riot, Discord). It also contains multiple requests to unknown domains and use of threading for parallel data collection. The code writes and uploads data without user consent. Extensive use of obfuscated strings and dynamic process management suggests malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is structured to stealthily gather sensitive information from the user's system, including browser credentials, cookies, application files, and application data. It decrypts stored encrypted data using system API calls, then prepares payloads with this information. It also collects files from specific application directories, archiving and uploading them via requests or a file hosting service. The code makes numerous network requests to obscure or malicious domains, including base64-encoded URLs, likely designed to avoid detection. It kills processes of targeted applications to prevent interference with data collection. The threading implementation speeds up the data collection process, indicating an emphasis on efficiency and stealth. The code also interacts with Discord webhooks to send data, further enabling remote exfiltration. Its obfuscation and multiple external dependencies strongly suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly malicious, functioning as a comprehensive info stealer targeting browsers, messaging apps, game clients, and wallets. It collects, decrypts, compresses, and exfiltrates sensitive data, and uploads files without user consent. The obfuscation, encrypted URLs, process termination, and extensive external network communications confirm malicious intent. It poses a severe security threat and should not be used or trusted.",
