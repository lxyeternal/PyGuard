      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious intent due to obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during setup, with red flags including silent failure handling and conditional logic. The scores are consistent with this assessment, indicating a high security risk. Further decoding of the PowerShell command is recommended to confirm malicious payloads."
