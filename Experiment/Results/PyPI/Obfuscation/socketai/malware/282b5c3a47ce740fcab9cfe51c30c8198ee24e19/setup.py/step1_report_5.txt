{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, installing dependencies, defining package metadata, and creating some auxiliary scripts and files, possibly for package distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads version info from a file, reads README content, and executes several subprocess calls for installing packages. It also decodes base64-encoded strings to write Python and VBScript files, which could contain embedded code.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess calls for package installation, writing of files decoded from base64 (potentially containing executable code), and creation of script files at various points. These are critical points where malicious payloads could be embedded.",
  "flows": "Version info extraction → Package setup → subprocess calls to install dependencies → decoding base64 strings to write Python scripts → writing VBScript file. The decoded strings likely contain executable code that could be malicious.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding to generate code files dynamically, including possibly obfuscated or hidden code. The presence of large base64-encoded blobs suggests hidden payloads. The script installs packages unconditionally via subprocess calls, which can be suspicious if used maliciously.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical package setup tasks, including version extraction and dependency installation. However, it also decodes base64-encoded strings and writes them as Python and VBScript files, which is an anomalous behavior. These embedded scripts could contain malicious code such as system calls, backdoors, or data exfiltration routines. The presence of decoded code with potential network activity, error handling, and possibly remote commands indicates a high risk of malicious intent. The reliance on dynamic code generation from encoded strings is a common tactic to hide malicious payloads. Overall, the code’s primary concern is the embedded base64 content, which could be malicious or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is primarily a setup script but includes obfuscated sections involving base64 decoding and script creation. The decoding content likely contains malicious or hidden code, potentially including remote control, data exfiltration, or other malicious actions. The script’s behavior warrants suspicion due to the dynamic code generation and embedded encoded payloads, which are common in malicious supply chain attacks.",
