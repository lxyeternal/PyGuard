{
  "purpose": "The code performs package setup, dependency installation, and decodes embedded base64 scripts that generate further scripts with suspicious behavior, including network activity and obfuscation.",
  "sources": "Base64-encoded strings decoded into scripts, reading version info, dependency installation commands, writing scripts to __pycache__ and other files.",
  "sinks": "Decoded scripts executing network requests, remote commands, writing files, and potentially executing malicious code.",
  "flows": "Base64 strings decoded into scripts -> scripts written to files -> scripts executed or loaded, performing network activity or system modifications.",
  "anomalies": "Large base64 payloads decoded into complex scripts, scripts written into __pycache__ and other directories, no validation or user consent before execution, embedded network activity and obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code contains multiple heavily obfuscated base64 payloads decoded into scripts that perform network connections, remote code execution, and system modifications. The process of decoding, writing, and executing scripts covertly indicates malicious intent. The structure and behavior align with common malware techniques such as hiding payloads, establishing backdoors, or exfiltrating data. The dependency installation without validation further increases security risk. Overall, the code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and likely malicious, employing obfuscation and covert payloads to perform unauthorized network and system operations. The embedded scripts decoded from base64 contain behaviors typical of malware, such as remote control and data exfiltration. The current scores are consistent with these findings, indicating a very high security threat.",
