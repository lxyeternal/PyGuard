      "confidence": 0.95,
      "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and likely malicious, employing obfuscation and covert payloads to perform unauthorized network and system operations. The embedded scripts decoded from base64 contain behaviors typical of malware, such as remote control and data exfiltration. The current scores are consistent with these findings, indicating a very high security threat."

      "conclusion": "The provided code snippet appears benign, with obfuscation not necessarily indicating malicious behavior. The reports of 'Empty response' lack context and do not substantiate any security concerns. Therefore, the code is likely safe, and the scores should reflect no malicious activity or vulnerabilities."

      "conclusion": "The code is primarily an obfuscated network connection handler that enforces SOCKS proxy usage. While no direct malicious actions are observed, the heavy obfuscation and network-centric design warrant cautious review before deployment, especially in security-sensitive environments. The suspicion level is moderate, and further analysis should be conducted in the context of the entire supply chain."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a complex, obfuscated proxy connector with configurable DNS resolution, capable of misuse but lacking concrete evidence of malicious payloads. It warrants cautious deployment and further review in the broader context, but is not confirmed malware."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, albeit highly obfuscated, proxy client supporting SOCKS4/5 and HTTP/HTTPS protocols. It does not contain explicit malware or malicious payloads but its obfuscation and proxy capabilities could be exploited for malicious purposes if embedded in a supply chain. The overall malware score should remain low (~0.2), with high obfuscation (~0.75) and moderate security risk (~0.5). It warrants careful vetting before use in sensitive environments."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting only of obfuscated exception class declarations. There is no evidence of malware or malicious behavior. The high obfuscation scores are justified, but the malware scores should remain at 0. The security risk scores are appropriately low. No changes are necessary; the current assessments are accurate."
