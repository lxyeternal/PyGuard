  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, albeit highly obfuscated, proxy client supporting SOCKS4/5 and HTTP/HTTPS protocols. It does not contain explicit malware or malicious payloads but its obfuscation and proxy capabilities could be exploited for malicious purposes if embedded in a supply chain. The overall malware score should remain low (~0.2), with high obfuscation (~0.75) and moderate security risk (~0.5). It warrants careful vetting before use in sensitive environments."
