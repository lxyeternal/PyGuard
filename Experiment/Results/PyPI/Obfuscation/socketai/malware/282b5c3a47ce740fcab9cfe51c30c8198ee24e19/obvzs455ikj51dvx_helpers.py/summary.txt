  "conclusion": "The code is primarily an obfuscated network connection handler that enforces SOCKS proxy usage. While no direct malicious actions are observed, the heavy obfuscation and network-centric design warrant cautious review before deployment, especially in security-sensitive environments. The suspicion level is moderate, and further analysis should be conducted in the context of the entire supply chain."
