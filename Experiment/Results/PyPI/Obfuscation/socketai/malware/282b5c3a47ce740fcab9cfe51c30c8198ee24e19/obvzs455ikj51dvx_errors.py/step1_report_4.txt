{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes, mostly inheriting from existing exception types, with no additional logic or data processing.",
  "sources": "Class definitions, inheritance declarations, and possibly the class names themselves.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or external data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow, input, or output operations; classes are simple exception definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Class names are obfuscated and do not convey meaningful purpose. All classes are empty and only extend existing exception types, which is unusual but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes with obfuscated names, inheriting from built-in exceptions such as Exception and OSError. The classes contain no methods or attributes, serving purely as custom exception types. The obfuscation of class names suggests an attempt to hide purpose or make reverse engineering harder. There is no evidence of malicious code, data leaks, or external communications. No suspicious input or output operations are present. The structure appears intentionally obscured, but functionally it only establishes custom exceptions.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely creates obfuscated custom exception classes with no logic, data handling, or external interactions. No malicious intent or malicious behavior is evident. The obfuscation may be for concealment or code compression, but it does not indicate malware or security risks.",
