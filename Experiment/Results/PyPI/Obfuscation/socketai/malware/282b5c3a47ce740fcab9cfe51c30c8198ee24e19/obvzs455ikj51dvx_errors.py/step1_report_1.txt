{
  "purpose": "Define multiple custom exception classes, mostly inheriting from a base exception class, with one inheriting from OSError.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and inheritance declarations; no input or data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "Class inheritance does not create data flows involving untrusted sources or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Class names appear to be random strings, which could indicate obfuscation. No actual functional code, logic, or data handling present. The code contains no calls, data manipulation, or execution commands.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class declarations for custom exceptions with obfuscated names. There are no functions, methods, or executable statements. The inheritance is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, data handling, or network communication. The obfuscated class names and absence of logic could be suspicious for hiding malicious intent, but no actual malicious behavior or malicious code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code defines multiple obfuscated exception classes without implementing any logic or data handling. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks within this snippet. The obfuscation may be suspicious but does not constitute malicious activity in itself.",
