{
  "purpose": "Define multiple custom exception classes, most of which are subclasses of a base exception class with a non-descriptive name.",
  "sources": "Class definitions, subclass inheritance",
  "sinks": "No data input/output or untrusted data handling identified",
  "flows": "Inheritance hierarchy from base exception classes",
  "anomalies": "Use of non-descriptive, obfuscated class names; no actual functional code or logic; no input handling or data processing",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of class declarations that create custom exception types with obfuscated class names. All classes are either subclasses of Exception or OSError, with no methods or attributes, and no data flow, input handling, or processing logic. This pattern does not exhibit malicious behavior by itself but could be used to obfuscate malicious intent if combined with other code. However, in isolation, it appears to be an obfuscation technique, possibly to hide malicious code elsewhere or to complicate analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be intentionally obfuscated with meaningless class names and no operational logic. There is no direct evidence of malicious behavior, but the obfuscation could be used to hide malicious code in a larger context. No suspicious data handling, network activity, or other malicious indicators are present in this fragment.",
