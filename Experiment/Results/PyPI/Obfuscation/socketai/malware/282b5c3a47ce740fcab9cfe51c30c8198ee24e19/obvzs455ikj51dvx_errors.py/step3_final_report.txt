{
  "purpose": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes with obfuscated class names, inheriting from Exception or OSError, with no methods or logic.",
  "sources": "Class declarations with obfuscated class names; no input, data reading, or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external calls; no untrusted data handling or network activity present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; only class inheritance without data or control flow.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class names that serve no functional purpose; no logic or data handling; purely class declarations.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions with obfuscated names, with no methods, data processing, or execution logic. The obfuscation could be suspicious but does not indicate malicious intent in isolation. No data flows, external calls, or malicious behaviors are present. The high obfuscation scores are justified due to the meaningless class names, but malware scores are correctly set to zero. The security risk scores are low, reflecting the absence of active malicious code. Overall, the code appears to be obfuscated exception class declarations with no malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting only of obfuscated exception class declarations. There is no evidence of malware or malicious behavior. The high obfuscation scores are justified, but the malware scores should remain at 0. The security risk scores are appropriately low. No changes are necessary; the current assessments are accurate.",
