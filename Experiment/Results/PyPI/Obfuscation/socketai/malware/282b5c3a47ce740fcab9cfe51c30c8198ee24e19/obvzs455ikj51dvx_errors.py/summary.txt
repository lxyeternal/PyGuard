  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting only of obfuscated exception class declarations. There is no evidence of malware or malicious behavior. The high obfuscation scores are justified, but the malware scores should remain at 0. The security risk scores are appropriately low. No changes are necessary; the current assessments are accurate."
