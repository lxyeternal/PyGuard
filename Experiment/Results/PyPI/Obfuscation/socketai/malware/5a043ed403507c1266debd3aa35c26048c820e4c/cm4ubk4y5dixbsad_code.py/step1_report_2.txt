{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be designed for extracting and exfiltrating sensitive user data such as cookies, passwords, tokens, and other personal information from various browsers, applications, and system paths. It also includes mechanisms for collecting system info, geolocation, and potentially other user activities, then sending this data to remote servers or webhooks.",
  "sources": "Reads data from browser storage directories, login databases, local system files (e.g., Chrome, Opera, Discord, Steam, Riot, Telegram, wallets), environment variables, and specific local files like 'Login Data', 'Local State', and certain directories containing user info.",
  "sinks": "Sends data to external webhooks, uploads files to third-party services (e.g., gofile.io), and executes system commands such as killing processes and zipping files for exfiltration. Also performs network requests that could be used for C2 communication or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Sources such as browser databases, wallet files, and system paths feed into functions that extract credentials, cookies, and other sensitive info. This data is then compiled into strings or files, which are subsequently uploaded or sent via web requests. Many functions involve creating threads that perform concurrent data collection and exfiltration activities. Data flows from local system sources through parsing, decryption, and processing routines to external servers or webhook endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated or complex variable names, dynamic module installations, repeated and convoluted code structures, suspicious URL endpoints (including Discord webhook), and multiple functions for stealing cookies, passwords, and other sensitive data. The code attempts to kill processes, zip files for exfiltration, and gather a wide range of user data, indicating malicious intent. The inclusion of data exfiltration methods, process termination commands, and automated data collection routines are typical of malware.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive credential stealer targeting browsers, messaging apps, and wallets. It uses environment variables to locate data directories, decrypts stored credentials, and collects various user-sensitive information. The code installs missing modules dynamically, indicating it may run on unprepared systems. Several functions handle data extraction, encryption/decryption, and network communication, often with obfuscated or convoluted logic. It also manages multi-threaded data collection, zipping, and uploading, which is typical of malware designed for covert data exfiltration. The presence of Discord webhook URLs and automated posting of user data confirms malicious intent. The code structure and variable names suggest obfuscation or effort to conceal its true purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This script is malicious software designed for credential and data theft from browsers, wallets, and messaging apps. It automates the collection, encryption, and exfiltration of sensitive user data via webhooks and file uploads. The use of process killing, threading, and obfuscation indicates an intent to operate covertly and effectively exfiltrate data without user knowledge. Overall, it is a high-security risk with clear malicious intent.",
