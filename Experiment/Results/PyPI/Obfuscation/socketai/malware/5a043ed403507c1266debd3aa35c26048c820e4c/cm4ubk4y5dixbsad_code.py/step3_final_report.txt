{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a malicious credential and data stealer, designed to extract user credentials, cookies, tokens, system info, and files from browsers, wallets, and applications, then exfiltrate this data via Discord webhooks and file uploads. It also terminates security-related processes to evade detection.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, browser login databases, cookies, local state files, wallet directories, application data folders, and network responses.",
  "sinks": "Discord webhook URL, file hosting services (gofile.io), process termination commands, zipped archives of stolen data, and in-memory data exfiltration routines.",
  "flows": "Data is collected from local sources (browsers, wallets, environment variables), decrypted or processed, then transmitted via webhooks or uploaded files, often after being compressed or encrypted, with process termination routines invoked to hinder detection.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with nonsensical variable names, dynamic module installation, multi-threaded data collection, process termination commands, and encrypted data handling routines. Hardcoded URLs and regex patterns for sensitive data are present.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits typical malware behaviors: credential theft, cookie and token extraction, system info gathering, process killing, multi-threaded data collection, and exfiltration via webhooks and file uploads. Obfuscation and dynamic dependencies further indicate malicious intent. The code's structure and routines align with known info-stealers and remote access trojans.",
  "conclusion": "The code is definitively malicious, performing credential theft, data exfiltration, process termination, and system manipulation. Its obfuscation and complex data handling routines confirm its intent to operate covertly. Scores of malware 1, obfuscation 0.8, and security risk 1 are justified and consistent with its behavior.",
