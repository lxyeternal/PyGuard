{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a malicious script designed to extract sensitive information such as cookies, passwords, tokens, and files from a user's system and exfiltrate them via webhooks or file uploads.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables, local files (e.g., login data, cookies, local storage), network responses (IP, geolocation, user relationships), and system directories related to browsers, messaging apps, and gaming platforms.",
  "sinks": "It sends data to Discord webhooks, uploads files to file-sharing services, executes system commands (taskkill), and writes data to local files. The code also potentially decrypts stored data using system cryptography functions.",
  "flows": "Sensitive data is collected from various sources such as browser storage, system files, and system info, then encrypted/decrypted as needed, and finally exfiltrated via HTTP requests to webhooks or file uploads. Data flows from sources (system files, environment variables, network) through processing functions to sinks (webhooks, files).",
  "anomalies": "The script installs missing modules silently, decrypts stored passwords and tokens, kills processes, archives files, and sends data without user consent. There are numerous obfuscated variable names, some functions are tailored for specific software (e.g., MetaMask, Steam), and it contains suspicious pattern matching and regex usage to find sensitive data. The code also writes data to temporary files and uploads them.",
  "analysis": "The code is highly suspicious, performing multiple malicious activities including: extracting stored passwords, cookies, tokens, and other sensitive info from browsers and applications; decrypting stored credentials using system cryptography functions; collecting user environment data such as IP and geolocation; silently installing or importing modules; killing processes related to security or antivirus software; archiving and exfiltrating files; and sending all collected data to a Discord webhook. Variable names and function names are obfuscated, and the code employs numerous indirect and obfuscated methods to gather and send data, indicating malicious intent. The script also seems to target specific applications (e.g., MetaMask, Steam) and may include functions to scan directories for specific keywords. Overall, the code demonstrates complex, multi-layered malicious activity aimed at data theft and system compromise.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, designed to steal user credentials, tokens, cookies, and system data, then exfiltrate it via webhooks and file uploads. It includes system process termination, decryption routines, and directory scanning to maximize data extraction. The obfuscated variable names, use of cryptography, and multi-method exfiltration confirm its malicious nature.",
