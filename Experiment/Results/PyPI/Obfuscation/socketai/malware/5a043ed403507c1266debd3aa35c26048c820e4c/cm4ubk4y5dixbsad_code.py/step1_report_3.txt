{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a malicious script designed to exfiltrate sensitive user data, including tokens, passwords, cookies, and files, and then send this data to a remote webhook or upload it to a file hosting service.",
  "sources": "The code reads user environment variables, accesses browser data (Chrome, Opera, Brave, Yandex, Edge), login data, cookies, Local State files, and potentially stolen files from certain directories and processes. It also reads input from directories and files related to user data, as well as environment variables and API responses from URLs.",
  "sinks": "The code sends data via HTTP POST requests to a Discord webhook and uploads files to gofile.io. It also writes data to temporary files and zips directories for exfiltration. It executes commands to kill processes, manipulate files, and create archives.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as login data, cookies, environment variables, browser data, and files to sinks such as webhook POST requests, file uploads, and process termination. Data exfiltration is achieved by collecting tokens, passwords, cookies, and files, then sending or uploading them remotely.",
  "anomalies": "The script uses obfuscated variable names, dynamically installs dependencies, kills processes (e.g., browsers, Steam, Riot Client), collects sensitive data, and sends it to a hardcoded Discord webhook. It also contains suspicious patterns such as regex for specific encrypted data, repeated thread handling, and the use of cryptographic functions for decryption. The code shows signs of data harvesting, file manipulation, and process termination typical of info-stealers.",
  "analysis": "The code initiates by importing modules and installing dependencies silently. It retrieves user environment data, collects browser login credentials, cookies, and local state files, and decrypts stored passwords. It fetches user profile information from Discord and other services, likely for profiling. It also searches user directories for specific keywords and exfiltrates the found data through Discord webhooks and file uploads. There are functions to kill processes, archive files, and gather sensitive data like tokens and passwords. Obfuscated variable names and repeated threading patterns suggest an attempt to evade detection. The script appears designed for large-scale data exfiltration and device compromise, indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is malicious, functioning as a data stealer targeting browser credentials, cookies, tokens, files, and user information. It exfiltrates data to a Discord webhook and uploads files to external hosts. Its structure, obfuscation, process termination, and data collection mechanisms confirm malicious behavior.",
