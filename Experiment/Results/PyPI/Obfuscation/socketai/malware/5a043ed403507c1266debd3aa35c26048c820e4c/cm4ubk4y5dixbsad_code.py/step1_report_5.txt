  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for malicious activities such as stealing user credentials, cookies, passwords, tokens, and sensitive data from browsers and applications. It also includes functions for collecting system information, taking screenshots, compressing and exfiltrating data, and possibly executing commands or stopping processes.",
  "sources": "Data is read from various system files and directories related to browsers (Chrome, Opera, Edge, Brave, Yandex), messaging apps (Discord, Telegram), wallet applications, Steam, and other software. It also reads environment variables, local state files, log files, and SQLite databases containing login data, cookies, and other sensitive information.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows into webhook URLs (discord webhook), request sending functions (requests.post, urlopen), and file writes for exfiltration. There are also system commands executed via subprocess, and files are compressed and uploaded. Data such as tokens, passwords, cookies, and personal info are being sent to external servers.",
  "flows": "Sources like system files, browser storage, and environment variables feed into data extraction functions. Extracted data (credentials, tokens, cookies, info) flows into functions that prepare reports or uploads, often through requests or zip file creation. Webhook URLs are used as sinks for exfiltrated data. There are also process termination commands and file manipulations that indicate control over the victim system.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names and function names, inconsistent code structure, and references to hardcoded URLs and webhook. The code attempts to install packages silently, use threading extensively, and perform network operations that seem unrelated to normal usage. Multiple parts of the code involve extracting sensitive data from various applications and exfiltrating them. Some functions handle malicious payloads, like killing processes or packing data into zip files. The code also appears to be designed for persistence or data collection for malicious purposes.",
  "analysis": "The script initiates by importing numerous modules, some with obfuscated or unclear variable names. It attempts to install dependencies like requests and Crypto, then proceeds to collect system info, including public IP. It includes multiple functions to extract browser data (cookies, passwords, local state), wallet data, and user credentials. It also can terminate processes, create zip archives of targeted data, and upload them via requests to external servers or webhooks. Many functions are designed to scan directories for sensitive files, decrypt stored credentials, and exfiltrate personal data. There are multiple points of hardcoded URLs, especially Discord webhook links, indicating data exfiltration to attacker-controlled endpoints. The code also includes functions to check user info via Discord API, which could be used for further targeting. Overall, the code is structured for automated data harvesting, exfiltration, and system manipulation, characteristic of malicious malware or spyware.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates clear malicious intent, with functions aimed at stealing sensitive data, exfiltrating information via webhooks, killing security-related processes, and collecting system information. Obfuscated variable and function names, silent dependency installation, and extensive use of threading reinforce its malicious purpose. The overall security risk score is high, and the malware likelihood is very high, indicating this code should not be used and represents a severe threat.",
