The obfuscation and misconfiguration suggest caution but do not constitute active threats. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is moderate (~0.45), and security risk is low (~0.25)."

      "conclusion": "The code is definitively malicious, performing credential theft, data exfiltration, process termination, and system manipulation. Its obfuscation and complex data handling routines confirm its intent to operate covertly. Scores of malware 1, obfuscation 0.8, and security risk 1 are justified and consistent with its behavior."
