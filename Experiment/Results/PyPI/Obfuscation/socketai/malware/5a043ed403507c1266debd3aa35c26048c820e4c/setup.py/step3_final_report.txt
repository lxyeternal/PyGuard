  "purpose": "Define package metadata for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static data in setup() parameters: name, version, license, keywords, install_requires, classifiers.",
  "sinks": "None; no dynamic input or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated package name 'cm4ubk4y5dixbsad'; 'install_requires' contains an empty string [''], which is invalid or misconfigured.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal setup script with static parameters. The package name appears obfuscated or randomly generated, which could be suspicious but isn't inherently malicious. The 'install_requires' list with an empty string is likely a misconfiguration rather than malicious. No dynamic code, network activity, or malicious logic is present. The absence of code injection, data leaks, or suspicious behavior indicates a low likelihood of malicious intent. The obfuscated name warrants caution but does not confirm malicious activity. The configuration issue with 'install_requires' should be corrected to prevent installation errors. Overall, the code is benign, with potential red flags related to naming and configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static setup configuration with an obfuscated package name and a malformed dependency list. No evidence of malware or malicious behavior is present. The obfuscation and misconfiguration suggest caution but do not constitute active threats. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is moderate (~0.45), and security risk is low (~0.25).",
