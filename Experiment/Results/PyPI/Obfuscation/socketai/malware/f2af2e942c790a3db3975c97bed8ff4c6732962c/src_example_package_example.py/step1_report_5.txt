  "purpose": "A simple function that increments a number by 1.",
  "sources": "The function takes an input parameter 'number'.",
  "sinks": "The output of the function is returned directly; no external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input 'number' flows directly into the addition operation, then to the return statement.",
  "anomalies": "The function name appears obfuscated, but the code itself is straightforward. No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic execution, or suspicious code patterns are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function with an obfuscated name that increments its input by 1. There are no external data sources, no data leaks, and no complex logic. The naming might suggest obfuscation, but the code is simple and benign. No malicious behavior, such as network activity, system modification, or data exfiltration, is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic increment function with obfuscated naming. It poses no security threat or malicious intent.",
