  "purpose": "A simple function that increments a given number by 1.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'number'.",
  "sinks": "The return statement that outputs the incremented number.",
  "flows": "Input 'number' flows directly to the addition operation, then to the output.",
  "anomalies": "The function name appears obfuscated; no other suspicious code or behavior is present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function with an obfuscated name, which takes a numerical input and returns the input incremented by 1. There are no external data sources, no use of environment variables, network activity, or other potentially malicious behavior. The obfuscated function name may suggest an attempt to hide intent, but the function's logic itself is benign and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a trivial, harmless increment operation. The obfuscated name could be suspicious, but the code itself shows no malicious activity or security risks.",
