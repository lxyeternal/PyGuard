{
  "purpose": "A trivial function that increments a number by 1, with an obfuscated name.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'number' received as function argument.",
  "sinks": "Return statement outputs the incremented number; no external data or network calls.",
  "flows": "Input 'number' flows directly to the return statement after incrementing.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function name; no suspicious code or behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward increment function with an obfuscated name. No external data sources, network activity, or malicious logic are present. The obfuscation is limited to the function name, which does not imply malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, securityRisk=0.1-0.2, obfuscated=0.7-0.8, confidence=0.8-1) are consistent with the benign and trivial nature of the code. No evidence suggests malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with obfuscation solely in the function name. The malware score remains at 0, and the security risk is minimal. The obfuscation score is justified by the function name's obscurity. Overall, the code poses no security threat, and the reports accurately reflect this.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.75,
  "malware": 0,
