{
  "purpose": "The function appears to increment a given number by 1.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'number' as the data source.",
  "sinks": "Return statement outputs the processed data; no other sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Input 'number' flows directly to the return statement after incrementing.",
  "anomalies": "The function name is obfuscated and non-descriptive, which could be suspicious. No other unusual code or behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single function that takes one argument and returns that argument incremented by 1. The function name is intentionally obfuscated, which may indicate an attempt to hide purpose, but the logic itself is straightforward and harmless. There are no external data sources, no data leaks, no network calls, and no suspicious code patterns. The simplicity suggests it's benign, but the obfuscated name warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple increment operation with an obfuscated function name. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided code snippet.",
