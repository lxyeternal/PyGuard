  "purpose": "A simple function that increments a given number by 1",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'number'",
  "sinks": "Return statement, which outputs the incremented number",
  "flows": "Input 'number' flows directly to the return statement after incrementing",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are present",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function with an obfuscated name that takes a single parameter and returns that parameter increased by one. There are no external data reads, no use of environment variables, network calls, or malicious logic. The code is straightforward and minimal, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a basic arithmetic operation with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It appears to be a simple, benign utility function.",
