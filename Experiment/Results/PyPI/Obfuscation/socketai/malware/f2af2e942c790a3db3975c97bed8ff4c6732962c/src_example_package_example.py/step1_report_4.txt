{
  "purpose": "Simple function that increments a given number by 1.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'number' (external data if passed from outside).",
  "sinks": "Return statement outputs the incremented number.",
  "flows": "Input 'number' flows directly to the return statement after incrementing.",
  "anomalies": "Function name appears obfuscated; no other suspicious code, no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function with an obfuscated name that takes one argument and returns its value increased by one. There are no external data reads besides the input parameter, no data leaks, no malicious network activity, and no complex or suspicious logic. The obfuscated name could be an attempt to hide purpose, but the function itself performs a benign operation. No security issues or malware indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward, benign function with obfuscated naming. No malicious behavior detected.",
