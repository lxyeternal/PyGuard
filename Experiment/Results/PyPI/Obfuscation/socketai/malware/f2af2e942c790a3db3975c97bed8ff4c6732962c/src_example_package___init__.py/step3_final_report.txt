  "purpose": "Analyze open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, external data inputs, dynamic code execution points (eval/exec), network connections, file operations, obfuscated variables.",
  "sinks": "Network transmissions, file writes/reads, subprocess calls, environment variable access, potential data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Input sources (environment, external data) -> processing (eval/exec, obfuscation) -> sinks (network, files, subprocesses).",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec, high obfuscation, connections to suspicious domains, hardcoded or suspicious credentials, unclear data flows.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are red flags. Suspicious network activity and obfuscated patterns suggest potential malicious intent. The presence of eval/exec without clear context increases suspicion. No explicit malicious payloads or backdoors are confirmed, but behaviors warrant caution. The scores assigned (malware 0.6, obfuscated 0.6, securityRisk 0.75) are justified based on these indicators. Benign code shows no such patterns, with scores of zero. Overall, the code's suspicious behaviors justify moderate to high concern, aligning with the scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates behaviors consistent with potential malicious activity, primarily due to obfuscation and dynamic code execution, with network connections to suspicious domains. The scores are appropriate, reflecting moderate to high risk. Minor adjustments could be made to slightly increase the malware score for code with significant obfuscation and dynamic execution, but current scores are justified.",
