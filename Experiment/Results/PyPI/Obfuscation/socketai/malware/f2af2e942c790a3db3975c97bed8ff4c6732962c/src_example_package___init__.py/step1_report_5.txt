  "purpose": "The code appears to implement a simple utility or script, but the specific purpose is not clear due to lack of context or comments.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from environment variables, input functions, or file I/O (if present).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, system commands, file writes, or data transmission points.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or user input to sinks like network or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscation are detected. The code is straightforward with no complex or obfuscated constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed for malicious behavior, including data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful operations. It only contains standard Python operations. There are no suspicious imports, no hardcoded secrets, and no network connections or system modifications detected. Without specific context or external dependencies, it appears benign. No anomalies or malicious patterns are identified. The lack of comments or unclear purpose does not indicate malicious intent but limits definitive conclusions.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit signs of malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided content. It appears to be a benign utility script with no evidence of malware or malicious activity.",
