{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package, with embedded code that fetches and executes remote scripts, and posts messages to a pastebin URL.",
  "sources": "Reading files ('README.md'), importing modules ('requests', 'random', 'subprocess'), fetching remote content ('https://pastebin.com/raw/3xcr2My4' and 'https://utilities.tk/rscode?r=mewhenrscode'), opening and writing to files ('./{r}.pyw').",
  "sinks": "Posting data over the network (requests.post), executing fetched code via subprocess.Popen, writing potentially malicious scripts to disk.",
  "flows": "Source: fetching remote scripts ('requests.get'), flows: remote content is written to a file ('./{r}.pyw'), then executed via subprocess, with a network request to pastebin also being made. Data read from files and fetched from remote servers is potentially used maliciously.",
  "anomalies": "Immediate POST request to pastebin with arbitrary content, fetching and executing remote scripts without validation, writing to temporary files with unpredictable names, use of shell=True in subprocess.Popen, unusual naming of 'OLZyEprsfqOrUKCLXMpWsrimyTYoEcDi' parameter in setup call.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules and then performs a POST request to a pastebin URL with a hardcoded message, which could be used for command-and-control or notification of execution. It fetches remote scripts from an untrusted domain ('https://utilities.tk/rscode?r=mewhenrscode'), saves them to a randomly named Python script file, and executes them with subprocess.Popen. This behavior allows remote code execution, which is a common indicator of malicious intent. Additionally, it reads a 'README.md' file unrelated to the malicious activities, and sets up a Python package with typical metadata. The use of 'shell=True' further increases security risk by allowing shell injection if the fetched content is malicious. The code's primary suspicious behavior is fetching and executing remote scripts, posting to pastebin, and writing files with unpredictable names. Overall, these actions are consistent with malicious or backdoor activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains clear indicators of malicious behavior, including remote code fetching and execution, network communication to suspicious URLs, and potentially malicious file creation. These behaviors suggest a high security risk.",
