{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package with potential malicious behavior, including code that executes remote scripts and sends data over the network.",
  "sources": "Requests to external URLs, reading 'README.md' file",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URLs (potential data exfiltration), executing downloaded code with subprocess.Popen",
  "flows": "Requests.get('https://pastebin.com/raw/3xcr2My4') -> requests.post (sending data), requests.get('https://utilities.tk/rscode') -> writing to a file -> executing file with subprocess.Popen",
  "anomalies": "Unusual use of requests to send data and execute remote code, dynamic filename generation, executing remote scripts without validation, reading 'README.md' but not using it, suspicious author name 'hacker'",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing 'setuptools' and then attempts to import 'requests' and 'random'. It then performs a POST request to a pastebin URL, sending a message with '@everyone' tag, indicating potentially malicious intent to notify or spam. Next, it retrieves a script from a remote URL, writes it to a dynamically named file based on a random number, and then executes that script via subprocess.Popen, which is highly suspicious and typical of malicious code execution. The code also reads 'README.md' but does not utilize its content. The setup configuration contains typical package metadata but includes the author name 'hacker', which raises suspicion. Overall, the code actively downloads, saves, and executes remote scripts, which is characteristic of malware or supply chain attacks.",
  "conclusion": "The script exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing remote code, sending data externally, and using suspicious naming and author information. It poses a high security risk and should be considered malicious.",
