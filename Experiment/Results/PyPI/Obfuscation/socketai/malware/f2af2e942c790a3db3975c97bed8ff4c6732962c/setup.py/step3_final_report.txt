{
  "purpose": "The code attempts to set up a Python package but contains embedded malicious activities including remote code fetch and execution, data exfiltration, and network communication with untrusted sources.",
  "sources": "Requests to 'https://pastebin.com/raw/3xcr2My4' and 'https://utilities.tk/rscode?r=mewhenrscode'; reading 'README.md'; fetching remote code; writing to a dynamically named file.",
  "sinks": "Network POST request to pastebin; remote code fetched via requests.get(); writing code to disk; executing remote code with subprocess.Popen with shell=True.",
  "flows": "Fetch remote code -> Save to file -> Execute via subprocess -> Send POST message; also read 'README.md' (benign).",
  "anomalies": "Immediate POST request with '@everyone'; remote code fetch from untrusted URL; use of 'shell=True'; dynamic filename; silent error handling; suspicious author 'hacker'.",
  "analysis": "The code performs active malicious behaviors: it fetches and executes remote scripts without validation, posts data externally, writes files with unpredictable names, and runs code via shell, all of which are classic indicators of malware. The use of 'shell=True' and dynamic filenames increases the attack surface. External URLs are untrusted, and error suppression hides failures. The setup metadata with author 'hacker' further indicates malicious intent. These behaviors confirm high malicious potential.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, actively executing remote scripts, exfiltrating data, and using risky subprocess calls. It warrants a malware score of 1 and a security risk score of 1 due to its active malicious behaviors and potential for system compromise.",
