  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential due to obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during package installation. The suspicious techniques employed—encoded commands, stealth execution, silent error handling—are indicative of malicious or sabotage behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are justified; I recommend a malware score of 0.85, obfuscation score of 0.9, and security risk score of 0.85 to reflect the high threat level."
