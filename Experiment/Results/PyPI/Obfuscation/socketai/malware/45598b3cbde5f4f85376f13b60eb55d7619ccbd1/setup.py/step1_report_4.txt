{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be a setup script for a Python package, with added functionality to install and run a suspicious file called 'rootkit'.",
  "sources": "The code reads command-line arguments (sys.argv), system commands via os.system(), and copies files from 'rootkit/dist/pip_security'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of system commands such as 'cp', 'install', and running 'rootkit &' in the background; copying files into system directories.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument check triggers execution of system commands to copy and run 'rootkit', indicating a source-to-sink flow that executes potentially malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual class and function names, use of system commands for copying and executing files, copying 'rootkit/dist/pip_security' into '/usr/local/bin/rootkit', and executing it as a background process. The code performs actions inconsistent with typical package setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools and overrides the 'install' command with a custom class. If the script is run with 'publish' argument, it builds and uploads a package. The custom install class, however, executes system commands that copy a file from 'rootkit/dist/pip_security' to '/usr/local/bin/rootkit', then attempts to execute it as a process. This behavior suggests the code is designed to install and run a potentially malicious program (named 'rootkit'), which is highly suspicious. The presence of the directory 'rootkit' and the naming conventions of classes and functions further imply malicious intent. The code does not perform typical setup tasks but instead engages in activities that can compromise system security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and appears to contain malicious behavior. It is designed to copy and execute a 'rootkit' from the package, which is indicative of malware activity. The purpose seems to be to install and run a potentially harmful rootkit on the host system, making this code malicious and dangerous.",
