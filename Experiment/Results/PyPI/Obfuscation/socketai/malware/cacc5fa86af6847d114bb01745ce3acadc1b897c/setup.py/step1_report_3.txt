{
  "purpose": "This code sets up a Python package with a specified name and version using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the import statements and the parameters passed to setup()",
  "sinks": "The setup() parameters could be used to influence package metadata, but no untrusted data handling is present",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; setup parameters are static",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures observed",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal setup script that imports setuptools and calls setup() with fixed package name and version. It lacks dynamic or untrusted input handling, no malicious functions, or suspicious behavior. The package name appears random, but that alone is not malicious. The script adheres to standard package setup conventions, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup script with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not perform any malicious actions or contain suspicious behavior.",
