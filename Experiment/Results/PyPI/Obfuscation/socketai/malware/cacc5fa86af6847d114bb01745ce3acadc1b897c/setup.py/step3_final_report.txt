  "purpose": "Minimal setup script for a Python package, importing setuptools and calling setup() with static parameters.",
  "sources": "Static import statements; no dynamic input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static code execution only.",
  "anomalies": "The package name 'daqmjce2yzwsz1h3' appears as a random or obfuscated string, which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with no dynamic or malicious behavior. The only notable anomaly is the package name, which looks obfuscated or randomly generated. No signs of code injection, network activity, or hidden payloads are present. The high obfuscation score in some reports is justified based on the name, but the code itself remains benign. Malware and malicious activity are not detected; the risk is minimal, primarily due to the suspicious package name. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, representing a standard setup script with an unusual package name. The main concern is the obfuscated or random package name, which warrants caution but does not indicate malicious intent. Scores should reflect no malware, high obfuscation due to the name, and very low security risk.",
