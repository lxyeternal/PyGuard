      "conclusion": "The code is unequivocally malicious, designed to silently download and execute external payloads during package installation, representing a severe security threat. The obfuscation and network activity further confirm malicious intent. All evidence supports a malware score of 1, with high security risk, and obfuscation around 0.8. Immediate removal and investigation are recommended."
