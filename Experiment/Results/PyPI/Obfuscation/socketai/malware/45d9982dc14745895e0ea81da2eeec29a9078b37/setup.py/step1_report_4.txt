{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, with added malicious behavior such as downloading and executing a potentially harmful file during installation.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' and makes HTTP GET requests to external URLs. Also executes system commands to run downloaded files.",
  "sinks": "Writing a downloaded executable file to disk and executing it with os.system('start ...'), potentially running malicious code.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' -> HTTP request to external URL -> Download of executable -> Execution of downloaded file",
  "anomalies": "Use of try-except block that silently ignores errors, downloading and executing external payload during package installation, obfuscated class and method names, no clear benign purpose for the network activity.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'requests' and 'setuptools' modules, with a custom installation command class that extends the 'install' command. Within the custom method, it retrieves the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable and makes a GET request to a suspicious URL. If on Windows, it downloads an executable from a third URL and executes it via 'os.system'. This behavior is not typical for a standard package setup and indicates malicious intent to run arbitrary code during installation. The code also uses obfuscated method and class names, further raising suspicion. All network activity and file execution happen unconditionally in the installation process, representing a significant security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior designed to download and execute a payload during package installation, which is highly suspicious and dangerous. This code is likely to perform unauthorized system actions and should be considered malicious.",
