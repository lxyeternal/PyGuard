{
  "purpose": "Simple script that prints 'installed' to the console",
  "sources": "No input or external data sources are used",
  "sinks": "Output to standard output (print statement)",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources; function is called immediately after definition, printing a static message",
  "anomalies": "The function name is obfuscated with a random string, but this alone is not malicious; no other suspicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function with a nonsensical name and immediately calls it, resulting in printing 'installed'. There are no inputs, no data manipulation, no external connections, or sensitive operations. The code is trivial, with no signs of malicious intent or behavior. The obfuscated function name could be an attempt to hide purpose, but given the simplicity, it appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward script that prints a message. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, contains no malware, and presents no security risks. The obfuscated function name is not suspicious on its own but indicates minimal effort to obfuscate, possibly for obfuscation's sake.",
