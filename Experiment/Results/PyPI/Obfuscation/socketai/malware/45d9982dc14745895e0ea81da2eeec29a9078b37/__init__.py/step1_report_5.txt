{
  "purpose": "The code defines and calls a function that prints a message indicating installation.",
  "sources": "The function is called immediately after its definition; no external input is read.",
  "sinks": "The code only outputs to the console; no untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow exists; the code simply prints a static message.",
  "anomalies": "The function name appears obfuscated and meaningless, which is unusual. No external input or environment variables are used. The code does nothing beyond printing a static message.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single function with a nonsensical name that outputs a fixed string 'installed'. There are no inputs, no data processing, and no interaction with external resources. The function name's obfuscation could be an attempt to hide intent, but the code itself performs only a benign print statement. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears benign, with no malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscated function name is unusual but not malicious in itself. It simply prints a message indicating installation status.",
