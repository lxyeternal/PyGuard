{
  "purpose": "The function appears to be a simple print statement indicating that a package or module has been installed.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are read by the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data could cause harm or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "The code flow is straightforward: defining a function that prints a message, then immediately calling it.",
  "anomalies": "The function name is a long, nonsensical string, which could suggest obfuscation or an attempt to hide purpose. No other suspicious behavior or hidden code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function with a seemingly random name and executes it immediately, resulting in a printed message 'installed'. There are no data inputs, no external calls, no file operations, network activity, or credential handling. The function is trivial and does not perform any malicious actions or contain obfuscated code. The unusual function name might be intended to obfuscate intent or evade simple static analysis.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, performing a simple print statement with an obfuscated function name. No malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
