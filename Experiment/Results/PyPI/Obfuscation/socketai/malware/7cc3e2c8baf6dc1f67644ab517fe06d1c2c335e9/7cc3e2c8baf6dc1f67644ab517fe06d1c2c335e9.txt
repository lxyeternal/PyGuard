      "obfuscated": 0.8,
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior, including remote code download, execution, persistence setup, and obfuscation. Despite minor technical errors, the intent is clear and consistent with malware. The high scores assigned in the reports are justified; I recommend setting the malware score to 1.0, obfuscation around 0.8, and security risk near 1.0 to reflect the severity."

      "conclusion": "The dependency shows significant suspicious patterns in reports 1 and 5, warranting caution. The scores are generally appropriate, with minor adjustments to better reflect the suspicion in report 5. The overall security risk is moderate to high, primarily driven by obfuscation and network activity, suggesting further investigation before deployment."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior, downloading and executing external code without validation, and setting up persistence mechanisms. The behavior is consistent with malware, justifying high malware and security risk scores. The code is not heavily obfuscated, with variable names being long but straightforward. Overall, the code is malicious and poses a significant security threat."
