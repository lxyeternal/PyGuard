  "conclusion": "The dependency shows significant suspicious patterns in reports 1 and 5, warranting caution. The scores are generally appropriate, with minor adjustments to better reflect the suspicion in report 5. The overall security risk is moderate to high, primarily driven by obfuscation and network activity, suggesting further investigation before deployment."
