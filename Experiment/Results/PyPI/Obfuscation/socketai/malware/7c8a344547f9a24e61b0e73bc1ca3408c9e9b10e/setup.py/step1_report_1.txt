{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package with a potentially malicious payload that attempts to execute hidden PowerShell commands.",
  "sources": "os.path.exists('tahg'), subprocess.Popen with encoded PowerShell command",
  "sinks": "subprocess.Popen executes the encoded PowerShell command, which likely acts as a sink for executing potentially malicious code",
  "flows": "Code checks for 'tahg' existence, then executes encoded PowerShell if not found",
  "anomalies": "Encoded PowerShell command, use of subprocess.Popen with no verification, silent execution, and hidden window flags suggest obfuscation and potential malicious activity",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup modules and attempts to run a hidden PowerShell command encoded in Base64 if a specific file does not exist. The encoded command likely performs malicious actions such as establishing a backdoor or downloading further payloads. The use of try-except blocks suppresses errors, which can hide failures. The setup call appears benign but may serve as a decoy or part of a malicious package distribution. The encoded command is suspicious due to obfuscation and hidden execution, indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, hidden execution of a PowerShell command that could be malicious, possibly establishing unauthorized access or performing harmful actions. It is highly suspicious and potentially dangerous.",
