  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script intended for data processing or utility functions, but the specific purpose cannot be determined from the provided fragment.",
  "sources": "Input data may come from function parameters, external files, environment variables, or network requests depending on omitted parts of the code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, network transmissions, file writes, or database queries, but specific instances are not visible in the provided fragment.",
  "flows": "Data flow paths are not explicitly shown due to incomplete code; typically, data from sources could be directed toward processing functions or output points.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are apparent in the visible code. The code structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The provided code fragment is incomplete, making it challenging to analyze fully. No suspicious patterns, hidden behaviors, or malicious code constructs are evident. Absence of sensitive data handling, unsafe operations, or obfuscated logic suggests a benign intent. Without further context or the rest of the code, the risk assessment remains limited.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the visible code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears standard and does not exhibit any suspicious patterns. Further review of the complete code may be necessary for a definitive assessment.",
