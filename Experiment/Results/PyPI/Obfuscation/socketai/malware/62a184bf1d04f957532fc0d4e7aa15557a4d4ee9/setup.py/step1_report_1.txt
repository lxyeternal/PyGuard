{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package named 'ztasimb', with custom install and develop commands that execute a specific function upon installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads external modules ('setuptools', 'os', 'base64', 'time', 'hashlib') and executes a base64-decoded string via os.system within the notmalfunc() function.",
  "sinks": "os.system() call executing decoded base64 string, which may run arbitrary shell commands.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom run method of AfterInstall invokes notmalfunc(), which decodes and executes a base64-encoded shell command via os.system. The setup metadata itself does not process untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "The presence of a base64-encoded string that is decoded and executed through os.system() is suspicious. The code uses base64 to obfuscate the actual shell commands, which is often a sign of malicious intent or attempts to hide malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and defines a function b64d() to decode base64 strings. The notmalfunc() function executes os.system() with a command that is base64-decoded from an encoded string. This string, once decoded, appears to contain a series of shell commands that make HTTP requests, possibly to fetch or execute remote scripts, and may include downloading or executing additional code. The custom setup commands (AfterInstall) call notmalfunc() during installation, meaning the potentially malicious commands execute automatically upon package installation. The obfuscation via base64 and the execution of shell commands raise suspicion, as this technique is often used to hide malicious payloads or perform malicious actions such as remote code execution, data exfiltration, or downloading further malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated execution of shell commands via base64 decoding and os.system(), triggered during package installation. This behavior is suspicious and potentially malicious, indicating that the package could perform unauthorized or harmful actions when installed. The code is designed to hide the true intent through obfuscation, which warrants caution.",
