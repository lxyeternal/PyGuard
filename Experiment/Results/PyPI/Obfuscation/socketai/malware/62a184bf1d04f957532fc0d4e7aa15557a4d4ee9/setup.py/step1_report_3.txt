{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, handling installation and development commands.",
  "sources": "The code reads encoded data within the 'notmalfunc' function and imports data from standard libraries such as 'os', 'base64', 'hashlib', and 'time'.",
  "sinks": "The 'os.system' call executes code decoded from a base64 string, which can run arbitrary shell commands. The base64-encoded string decodes to potentially malicious commands that perform network requests and other actions.",
  "flows": "The base64-encoded string is decoded by 'b64d' and then executed by 'os.system', creating a flow from encoded data to shell command execution.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a base64-encoded string that, when decoded, runs network requests and other potentially malicious commands. The code uses dynamic execution via 'os.system' with decoded data, which is suspicious. The function name 'notmalfunc' is misspelled, possibly to evade detection.",
  "analysis": "The script is a setup configuration that imports standard libraries and defines functions. The 'notmalfunc' function decodes a base64 string, which when decoded, appears to run a shell command that performs network requests to GitHub URLs, likely fetching or executing remote code. This behavior indicates malicious intent, such as fetching remote code or data. The function 'notmalfunc' is invoked during the 'AfterInstall' class's 'run' method, meaning this potentially malicious code executes during package installation. The use of encoded commands and execution via 'os.system' are typical indicators of malicious behavior aimed at covertly executing remote code or commands. Overall, the code leverages obfuscation and dynamic execution to conceal malicious activities during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "This package setup script contains obfuscated malicious code that executes remote commands during installation, representing a significant security risk. The decoding and execution pattern is typical of supply chain attacks intending to run malicious payloads upon package installation.",
