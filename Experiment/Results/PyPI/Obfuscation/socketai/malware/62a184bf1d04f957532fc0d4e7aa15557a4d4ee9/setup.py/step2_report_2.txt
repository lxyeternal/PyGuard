  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the claims, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  Yes. The code decodes a base64 string and executes it via `os.system()`. The decoded string contains commands that make HTTP requests, likely to fetch or run remote scripts. The execution occurs during package installation (`AfterInstall`), which is suspicious.\n\n- **Errors/Flaws in reasoning?**  \n  No significant flaws. The reasoning correctly identifies obfuscation and malicious potential.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0.7  \n  - Obfuscated: 0.8  \n  - Risk: 0.75  \n\n  These seem reasonable given the evidence.\n\n- **Justification for high scores:**  \n  The code actively executes decoded shell commands during install, which is a security concern. The obfuscation via base64 is typical of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  Yes. Similar to Report 1, with base64-encoded commands decoded and run via `os.system()`. The commands include network requests to GitHub, indicating possible remote code fetching.\n\n- **Errors/Flaws?**  \n  No. The analysis aligns with the code.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0.8  \n  - Obfuscated: 0.9  \n  - Risk: 0.85  \n\n  These are appropriate, reflecting high malicious potential.\n\n- **Justification:**  \n  The code's behavior suggests an attempt to silently download and execute remote scripts, which is highly dangerous.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  Yes. The pattern remains consistent: base64-encoded string decoded and executed via `os.system()`, during installation.\n\n- **Errors/Flaws?**  \n  No. The reasoning is accurate.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0.9  \n  - Obfuscated: 0.8  \n  - Risk: 0.9  \n\n  These are justified, given the high likelihood of malicious activity.\n\n- **Additional note:** The misspelling of `notmalfunc` appears intentional, possibly to evade detection, but doesn't affect the malicious assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  Yes. Same pattern: obfuscated commands decoded and executed during setup.\n\n- **Errors/Flaws?**  \n  No. The reasoning is sound.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0.9  \n  - Obfuscated: 0.8  \n  - Risk: 0.9  \n\n  These scores are consistent with the behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  Yes. Consistent with previous reports: obfuscated code executed during install.\n\n- **Errors/Flaws?**  \n  No. The analysis is correct.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0.9  \n  - Obfuscated: 0.8  \n  - Risk: 0.9  \n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code Confirmation:**  \n  All reports correctly identify that the code decodes a base64 string and executes it via `os.system()`. The string, once decoded, runs shell commands that involve network requests, which are suspicious and potentially malicious.\n\n- **Logical Flaws:**  \n  No significant flaws. The reports consistently recognize the obfuscation and malicious potential.\n\n- **Scores Consistency:**  \n  The scores across reports are aligned with the observed behavior. The malware scores are high (0.8–0.9), reflecting malicious activity. Obfuscation scores are also high, given the use of base64 encoding.\n\n- **Justification for Scores > 0.5:**  \n  The package executes remote commands during installation, which can lead to remote code execution, system compromise, or data exfiltration. These are serious security risks justifying high scores.\n\n- **Malware Score Justification:**  \n  The decoded commands appear to perform network requests to external URLs, likely to fetch or execute malicious payloads. This is a strong indicator of malware behavior, warranting scores ≥0.8.\n\n- **Obfuscation Score Justification:**  \n  The use of base64 encoding to hide commands is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to evade static detection.\n\n- **Potential Vulnerabilities & Assumptions:**  \n  The reports correctly assume malicious intent based on obfuscation and remote command execution. No assumptions are overly speculative; the behavior is clearly suspicious.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0.9  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0.8  \n**Risk Score:** 0.9\n\nThese reflect a highly malicious, obfuscated, and dangerous package.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their assessment. The code is malicious, obfuscated, and executes remote commands during setup, representing a severe security threat.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nThis package should be considered unsafe for installation. Further investigation into the decoded commands is advised to understand the full scope of malicious activities.",
