{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up a Python package named 'ztasimb' with custom install and develop commands, including an obfuscated function that executes decoded base64 content.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from hardcoded base64-encoded string within the 'notmalfunc' function.",
  "sinks": "The decoded string executes system commands via os.system(), which can run arbitrary code, including network requests, scripts, or malicious commands.",
  "flows": "The base64-encoded string is decoded by 'b64d' and then executed via os.system() within 'notmalfunc', which is called during package installation (AfterInstall.run).",
  "anomalies": "The use of base64 encoding to hide the actual command executed, coupled with system calls that execute decoded code, is suspicious. The decoded script appears to perform network operations and potentially malicious actions, such as fetching and executing code from external URLs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools and defines custom install/develop commands that, upon installation, execute a function ('notmalfunc') which decodes and runs obfuscated code. The obfuscated code, when decoded, performs system commands that likely include downloading and executing external scripts, indicating malicious intent. The pattern of encoding and executing code from a base64 string is commonly used to hide malicious payloads. No other third-party libraries are used suspiciously, but the core logic indicates deliberate concealment and execution of potentially malicious code during setup.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains obfuscated code that executes decoded system commands during installation, indicating malicious intent. The use of base64 encoding to hide payloads and execution via os.system() suggests an attempt to conceal malicious behavior, such as downloading or executing harmful scripts. It should be considered unsafe for installation.",
