  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that includes custom installation behavior and potentially executes embedded code.",
  "sources": "The base64-encoded string in the 'notmalfunc' function, which is decoded and executed via os.system.",
  "sinks": "The decoded code is passed to os.system for execution, which can execute arbitrary shell commands.",
  "flows": "Base64 string is decoded in 'notmalfunc' -> executed via os.system in the shell command.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated code via base64 decoding; execution of decoded code via os.system; no visible checks or sanitization of the decoded string.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a function 'notmalfunc' that decodes a base64-encoded string representing shell commands. This function is called during the 'run' method of the custom 'install' class, which is invoked during package installation. The embedded command appears to fetch and execute remote scripts from GitHub URLs, which could be malicious. The code employs obfuscation techniques, such as base64 encoding, to hide the true intent. The use of os.system to execute dynamically decoded code is a significant security risk, enabling arbitrary command execution. The overall structure indicates an attempt to include hidden malicious behavior within a standard setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated malicious behavior by decoding and executing remote or embedded shell commands during package installation. This is a high security concern as it can lead to remote code execution and system compromise. It appears intentionally designed to hide malicious actions within the setup process, which is highly suspicious.",
