{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that includes custom install and develop commands with embedded obfuscated code execution.",
  "sources": "Base64-encoded string in notmalfunc() function, os.system call within notmalfunc()",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing decoded base64 command, which runs potentially malicious shell commands",
  "flows": "Base64 string decoded in notmalfunc(), then passed to os.system() for execution",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding to obfuscate a shell command, execution of code via os.system() with decoded content, no explicit comments or documentation explaining the purpose of the command",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function b64d() to decode base64 strings, then uses it within notmalfunc() to decode a string that appears to contain shell commands. The decoded string is executed via os.system(), which runs commands that include downloading files from a GitHub URL, executing scripts, and potentially malicious activities. This obfuscated command could be used to fetch and execute malicious payloads silently during installation. The setup script hooks into both 'install' and 'develop' phases, with the latter running the obfuscated code. There are no other security mechanisms, input validations, or logging, making the embedded command suspicious. The use of base64 encoding suggests an intent to hide malicious activity or evade simple static analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains obfuscated code that executes potentially malicious commands during package installation, indicating high malicious intent. The use of base64 decoding and os.system() to run embedded shell commands is suspicious and could compromise system security. The code is likely intended to download and execute malicious payloads during package setup.",
