{
  "purpose": "The code decodes a base64-encoded string and executes it via os.system() during package installation, likely to run malicious commands or fetch remote payloads.",
  "sources": "The base64-encoded string within notmalfunc(), decoded and executed during AfterInstall.run().",
  "sinks": "os.system() call executing decoded shell commands that perform network requests and potentially malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The base64 string is decoded in b64d(), then passed to os.system() in notmalfunc(), which runs the commands during package setup.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding to obfuscate shell commands; execution during install; misspelling of 'notmalfunc'; commands include network requests to external URLs.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a function that decodes a base64 string and executes it via os.system() during package installation. The decoded commands involve network requests to external domains, indicating remote code fetching or malicious activity. The obfuscation via base64 suggests an attempt to hide malicious intent. The execution during setup makes this a potential supply chain attack vector. The misspelling of 'notmalfunc' appears intentional to evade detection but does not affect the malicious assessment. The high scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.85, obfuscated ~0.85, risk ~0.9) are justified given the behavior. The pattern of decoding and executing remote commands is characteristic of malicious or sabotage activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential, executing obfuscated remote commands during installation, which poses a severe security threat. The high malware, obfuscation, and risk scores are justified. This package should be considered unsafe until further analysis of the decoded commands is performed.",
