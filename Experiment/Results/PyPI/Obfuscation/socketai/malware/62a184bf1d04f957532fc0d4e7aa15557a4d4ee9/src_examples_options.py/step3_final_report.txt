{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a straightforward Python script with no explicit malicious intent or suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "No explicit sources or data input points identified; code reads environment variables or user input in a benign manner.",
  "sinks": "Outputs to print or files; no untrusted data flow leading to sensitive operations detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment or user inputs to outputs; no suspicious or malicious source-to-sink paths identified.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs observed; code structure appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is simple, with no signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or malicious behavior. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The confidence score of 0.7 reflects reasonable certainty based on the limited snippet. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk score is appropriate, and the overall assessment indicates a safe dependency.",
  "confidence": 0.7,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
