      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential, executing obfuscated remote commands during installation, which poses a severe security threat. The high malware, obfuscation, and risk scores are justified. This package should be considered unsafe until further analysis of the decoded commands is performed."

      "conclusion": "Most reports are benign or unassessable due to lack of code, with Report 3 indicating moderate suspicion. Adjusting the malware score for Report 3 to 0.6 enhances the accuracy of the risk assessment. No other adjustments are necessary. Continuous monitoring and further analysis of suspicious code in Report 3 are recommended."
