  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior typical of malicious payloads, including obfuscated, stealthy execution of a PowerShell command during package installation. While the exact payload is unknown without decoding, the pattern warrants high suspicion and caution. The high malware, obfuscation, and risk scores are justified. Further analysis should decode the PowerShell command to confirm its intent."
