{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up a Python package with custom installation behavior that sends system information to an external URL during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads system hostname, current working directory, and username from the environment; it also performs an HTTP GET request to an external URL with these parameters.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get call transmits data over the network to an external server, potentially exposing sensitive system info.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, cwd, username) is collected and sent via an HTTP GET request to an external server during installation.",
  "anomalies": "The code gathers system data and transmits it without user consent or transparency, using obfuscated class and variable names, which suggests stealth. The URL is suspiciously structured, potentially indicating tracking or malicious data collection.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup-related modules and other libraries, then defines a class inheriting from 'install' with an obfuscated name. During the install process, it overrides a method (also obfuscated), calls the parent method, then collects hostname, current directory, and username, and sends these via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external URL. The setup function uses a malformed dictionary key 'ifzbjywEHTCWjRwouRircXyuusIHLnNc', which appears to be obfuscated or intentionally misleading. The data collection and transmission during package installation without user awareness indicates malicious intent, such as tracking or data exfiltration. The code uses obfuscation techniques, such as random class names and variable names, which is typical in malicious or maliciously compromised packages.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains potentially malicious behavior, collecting and transmitting system information during installation without user consent. The obfuscation and data exfiltration to a suspicious URL suggest malicious intent, possibly for tracking or unauthorized data collection.",
