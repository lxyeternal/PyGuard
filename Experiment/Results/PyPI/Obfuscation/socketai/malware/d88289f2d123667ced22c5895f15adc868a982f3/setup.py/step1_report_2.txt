{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package with custom installation behavior that collects system information and sends it to an external URL during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads hostname, current working directory, and username from the system; it also imports external modules such as requests.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get call sends collected data to an external server, potentially leaking system information.",
  "flows": "During the installation process, the custom install class gathers system info and transmits it via an HTTP GET request to an external domain.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a custom-named class and obfuscated variable names; data exfiltration during setup; hardcoded URL for data collection; no user consent or transparency.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that extends setuptools' install command. During installation, it gathers hostname, current directory, and username, then sends this data to an external URL via an HTTP GET request. The package setup uses this custom class, which results in data exfiltration at install time. The obfuscated class and variable names suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent. The external request to 'http://5r13v9.ceye.io' indicates possible malicious tracking or data theft. No other malicious code, such as reverse shells or destructive actions, is present, but the data exfiltration behavior is suspicious and could compromise user privacy and security.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during installation without user consent. The obfuscation and external data transmission indicate malicious intent. Use of this package poses a security and privacy risk and should be avoided.",
