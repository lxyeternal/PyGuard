{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that overrides the install command to perform additional actions during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), and getpass.getuser(), which are system environment details.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get() call sends collected data to an external URL ('http://5r13v9.ceye.io') with parameters containing hostname, current working directory, and username.",
  "flows": "Source functions (hostname, cwd, username) -> Data stored in dictionary -> Data sent via requests.get() to external URL.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes the code collecting system information and immediately sending it to an external server during package installation, which is not standard practice. The class name and variable names are obfuscated or nonsensical, indicating potential obfuscation or malicious intent. The external URL appears suspicious and could be used for tracking or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that extends the setuptools install command. During installation, it gathers system information (hostname, current directory, username) and sends this data to an external server. This behavior is unusual for a typical setup script, as it attempts to exfiltrate environment details without user consent. The use of an external URL with an obfuscated class and variable names suggests malicious intent or malicious payload embedding. No other malicious behaviors like code injection or data theft beyond information gathering are present, but the data exfiltration nature raises security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting and transmitting system environment details during installation without user consent. The data exfiltration pattern and obfuscated code strongly indicate malicious intent. This package should be considered unsafe for use.",
