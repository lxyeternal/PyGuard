  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that extends installation behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads system hostname, current working directory, and username, and sends this data via an HTTP GET request to an external URL during installation.",
  "sinks": "HTTP request to an external server with system information as parameters.",
  "flows": "During package installation, the code collects hostname, cwd, and username, then transmits this data to an external URL.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class and variable names, and the collection and transmission of system data without user consent during installation, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. The data exfiltration occurs silently as part of the install process.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of the install command that overrides the run method (named obfuscated). During execution, it gathers hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this information to a remote server via a GET request. This behavior occurs during package installation, which is unusual and indicates possible malicious intent such as user tracking or data exfiltration. The obfuscation of class and variable names further raises suspicion. No other malicious code or backdoors are detected, but the data collection and transmission are suspicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting system information during installation and exfiltrating it to an external server without user consent. This indicates a supply chain security risk and potential privacy violation.",
