{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package installation process that, during installation, collects system information and sends it to a remote server.",
  "sources": "The code reads hostname (socket.gethostname()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), and username (getpass.getuser()).",
  "sinks": "The code sends collected data via an HTTP GET request to 'http://5r13v9.ceye.io' using the requests library.",
  "flows": "Data collected from system information sources flows into the requests.get call as URL parameters, transmitting system info to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class name, unusual parameter name in setup ('ifzbjywEHTCWjRwouRircXyuusIHLnNc'), and data exfiltration during package install are suspicious. The code performs unexpected network activity during installation without explicit user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that, upon installation, gathers hostname, current working directory, and username. It then sends this information to an external URL. The use of obfuscated class name and the timing of data transmission during setup suggest malicious intent or malicious behavior. No input validation or security checks are present, and the code contacts a suspicious domain. The code does not perform any other security-relevant actions but exfiltrates system data covertly during installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by secretly collecting and transmitting user and system information during package installation. This behavior constitutes a privacy violation and potential security risk, indicating malicious intent.",
