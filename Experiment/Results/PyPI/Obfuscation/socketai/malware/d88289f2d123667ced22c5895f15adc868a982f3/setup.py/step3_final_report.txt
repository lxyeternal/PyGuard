{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information (hostname, current directory, username) during package installation and exfiltrates it to an external URL, indicating malicious data theft behavior.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() call sending data to external URL",
  "flows": "Source functions (hostname, cwd, username) -> data assembled into params -> requests.get() to external server during install",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names, suspicious external URL, data exfiltration during setup without user consent, obfuscated dictionary key",
  "analysis": "The code defines an obfuscated class inheriting from 'install' that overrides a method to collect hostname, current directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious URL during package installation. The obfuscation and network activity are typical of malicious behavior aimed at covert data collection. The setup call includes an obfuscated key, further indicating malicious intent. No other malicious actions such as destructive payloads or backdoors are present. The data exfiltration occurs silently during install, violating user privacy. The code's behavior aligns with known supply chain attacks involving stealthy data theft. The high confidence in maliciousness is justified by the clear exfiltration activity, obfuscation, and suspicious URL, with scores reflecting significant security and privacy risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior through covert data exfiltration during package installation, supported by obfuscation and suspicious external URL. It poses a high security and privacy risk, warranting classification as malicious.",
