{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information such as hostname, current working directory, username, IP addresses, and directory listings, encodes this data, and exfiltrates it to a suspicious external URL during package installation, likely for malicious surveillance or data theft.",
  "sources": "os.listdir for directory listings; socket.gethostname(); os.getcwd(); getpass.getuser(); netifaces interfaces for IP addresses; constructed hostname/IP for resolution.",
  "sinks": "requests.post to 'https://425a2.rt11.ml' with JSON-encoded system info, representing data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Data is gathered from sources, encoded/processed, and then sent via HTTP POST to the external server, with hostname resolution possibly serving as a check or covert channel.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of variable and function names; encoding data into hex; constructing and resolving hostnames/IPs; silent exception handling hiding errors; data exfiltration during setup; use of a suspicious domain.",
  "analysis": "The script, during setup, gathers hostname, current directory, username, IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6), and directory listings. It encodes these data points into hex strings, constructs a hostname/IP string, attempts to resolve it, and then sends the collected data via an HTTP POST request to an external URL. The obfuscated variable names and encoding techniques suggest an intent to hide malicious activity. The data exfiltration occurs unconditionally, indicating covert surveillance or data theft. The code's behavior aligns with typical backdoor or spyware functions embedded in supply chain attacks. The network activity, data encoding, and obfuscation strongly point to malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits covert data collection and exfiltration during package installation, with obfuscation and network checks indicating malicious surveillance or backdoor functionality. It should be classified as highly malicious, with high malware and security risk scores.",
