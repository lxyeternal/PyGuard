{
  "purpose": "Setup script that customizes installation behavior and collects system information, potentially for malicious data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Reads system hostname, current working directory, username, network interfaces, and IP addresses. Also reads file paths from provided directories.",
  "sinks": "Sends collected data via POST request to an external server 'https://425a2.rt11.ml'. Uses socket functions for hostname resolution, which could be exploited for malicious purposes.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (system hostname, username, IP addresses, file paths) through data formatting and encoding, then via an HTTP POST request to an external URL.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names; dynamic hex encoding of hostname, username, and paths; network activity to an external server with a suspicious domain; complex and unnecessary string manipulations that obfuscate intent; attempt to resolve constructed domain names, possibly for C2 communication.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple functions to gather system network info, IP addresses, and file paths, with obfuscated naming. It encodes hostname, username, and other identifiers in hex, then constructs a domain-like string and resolves it via socket, which may be used for command and control or data exfiltration. The setup class override gathers system details, encodes sensitive info, and performs a POST request to an external server, indicating possible malicious data collection. The external URL appears suspicious and unrelated to legitimate package functionality. The code does not perform any legitimate setup tasks and focuses heavily on system info gathering and network activity, consistent with malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains obfuscated and suspicious data collection and exfiltration behaviors. The POST request to an external, non-legitimate domain and the encoding of system details suggest malicious intent, likely to steal system info or establish covert communication channels. The code is highly suspicious and should be considered malicious or a security threat.",
