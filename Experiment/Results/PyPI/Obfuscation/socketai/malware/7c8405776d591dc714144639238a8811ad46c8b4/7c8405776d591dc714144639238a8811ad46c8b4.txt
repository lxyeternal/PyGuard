      "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior characteristic of malicious activity, notably the obfuscated, hidden execution of a PowerShell command during package setup. The use of Base64 encoding, silent error handling, and conditional execution strongly suggest malicious intent. Scores of malware (0.8), obfuscation (0.9), and security risk (0.85) are justified given these indicators. Further decoding of the PowerShell command is recommended to confirm payload intent, but current evidence warrants high suspicion and treatment of this package as malicious."
