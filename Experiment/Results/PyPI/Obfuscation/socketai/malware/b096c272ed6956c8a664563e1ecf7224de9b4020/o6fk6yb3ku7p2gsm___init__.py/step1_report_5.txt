{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script for data processing and network communication, likely intended for legitimate purposes such as data collection or reporting.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, user input via functions, or external data files; network requests to external servers.",
  "sinks": "Network calls sending data to external domains, writing to system files, or executing commands based on input data.",
  "flows": "Data read from sources (environment variables, user input) flows into processing functions, then potentially sent over the network or written to files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network domains, or obfuscated code detected. No unusual code constructs or backdoors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical data processing and network operations. It imports standard libraries, processes data, and may send data externally. No evidence of malicious payloads such as reverse shells, credential theft, or data exfiltration was found. Usage of environment variables and user input is standard, with no unsafe handling observed. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious control flow.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs expected data processing tasks without any suspicious activity. The overall security risk is low.",
