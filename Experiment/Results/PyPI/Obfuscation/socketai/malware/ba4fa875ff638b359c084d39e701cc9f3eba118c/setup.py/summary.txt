  "security_risk": 0.85,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to obfuscated, stealthy PowerShell execution during setup. The high obfuscation, concealment, and silent error handling increase the risk profile significantly. The scores are consistent with these findings, indicating a high probability of malicious intent."
