  "purpose": "Set up configuration for a Python package named 'zwotfi3ycjjxl7z5', including a console script entry point.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata (name, version, install_requires) and the console_scripts entry in setup()",
  "sinks": "Execution of the 'zlib-compress' script via the console_scripts entry point",
  "flows": "Setup metadata → user installs package → console_scripts entry point 'zlib-compress' executes 'zlibsrc.cli:main'",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated or nonsensical variable names (e.g., 'PpQbebdCDnYuOXDJwMXSigNzQjXbAWxZ'), and unusual variable naming; no actual code logic or executable code besides setup configuration",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools, with obfuscated variable names. It defines package name, version, dependencies (empty list), and an entry point for a command-line tool. No malicious code or suspicious behavior is present; the variable names are intentionally obfuscated but do not influence execution or security. The script appears to be an ordinary package configuration, possibly intentionally obscured.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup configuration with obfuscated variable names, but no malicious behavior or security risks are evident. It appears to be a typical package setup script with no suspicious activity.",
