      "conclusion": "The provided setup script is a benign configuration with obfuscated variable names and an external CLI entry point. There is no evidence of malicious code within this snippet. The main security concern is the trustworthiness of the 'zlibsrc' module. Scores are set accordingly: malware=0, obfuscated=0.8, securityRisk=0.2."

      "obfuscated": 0.85,
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits classic malware behavior: remote code download, execution without validation, obfuscation, and hosting on a suspicious CDN. All reports correctly identify these traits, and their scores are appropriate. The main discrepancy is the mention of calling a 'main' method, which does not exist; the constructor runs the download and execution. Overall, the code should be considered highly malicious with a malware score of 1.0, obfuscation around 0.8, and security risk at 1.0. It poses a severe security threat and should be blocked or analyzed in a sandbox environment."
