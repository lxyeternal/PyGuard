  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated color matching utility with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The high obfuscation score is justified, but the malware score remains zero, and the overall security risk is low. The scores in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior."
