  "purpose": "Terminal styling utility with color management and console configuration.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (FORCE_COLOR, NO_COLOR), system info, import from '.hex' module, local variables.",
  "sinks": "ANSI escape sequences, Windows console API calls via ctypes.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and input parameters influence ANSI code generation and console mode settings.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names, large color mapping dictionary, import from a non-standard '.hex' module.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages terminal styling, generating ANSI escape sequences, and configuring Windows console modes. Obfuscation appears to be for concealment rather than malicious intent. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious system modifications are evident. The heavy obfuscation and import from '.hex' raise suspicion but do not demonstrate malicious behavior. The code does not process untrusted input into critical system components or transmit data. The Windows API calls are standard for enabling color support in terminals.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a terminal styling utility with obfuscated elements. There are no signs of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The high obfuscation level is likely intended for concealment but does not indicate malicious intent. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score is zero.",
