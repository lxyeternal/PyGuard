      "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with an obfuscated package name that warrants attention but does not constitute malicious activity. Scores should reflect no malware (0), moderate obfuscation (~0.2-0.5), and low security risk (~0.1). The overall assessment confirms the package is safe but the name's obscurity should be noted for further review if part of a larger supply chain."

The high obfuscation level is likely intended for concealment but does not indicate malicious intent. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score is zero."

The obfuscation is notable but not malicious; it could be misused if the imported list is maliciously crafted. Overall, the code is benign and primarily stylistic."
