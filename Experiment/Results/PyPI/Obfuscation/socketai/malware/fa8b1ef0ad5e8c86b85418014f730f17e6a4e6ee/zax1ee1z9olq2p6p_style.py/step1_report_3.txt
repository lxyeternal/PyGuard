  "purpose": "Define ANSI escape codes for text styling and create variables for different styles.",
  "sources": "Class attribute assignments, iteration over dictionary items to set variables dynamically.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or perform security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Dictionary items are used to generate variable names for style codes; no data flows from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual class and variable naming; dynamic creation of variables with style names; no clear malicious intent, but obfuscation is notable.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class that sets up ANSI escape sequences for terminal text formatting. It stores escape codes as class variables, generated dynamically via iteration over a dictionary of style names and codes. The variable names are derived directly from dictionary keys, and their values are formatted escape sequences. No input/output, network operations, or security-sensitive functions are present. The obfuscation through non-descriptive naming and dynamic variable creation could be suspicious in some contexts, but here it appears to be a benign utility for styling console output.",
  "conclusion": "The code is an obfuscated yet straightforward utility for ANSI styling with no malicious behavior detected. It does not process external data, perform network operations, or contain malicious payloads.",
