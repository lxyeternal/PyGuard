  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Static code defining package name, version, and dependencies; no external input or runtime data.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows or external data handling.",
  "flows": "None; static configuration without data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual, nonsensical package name 'zax1ee1z9olq2p6p', which could suggest obfuscation or concealment.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with no dynamic behavior, malicious code, or external data processing. The only anomaly is the package name, which appears obfuscated or nonsensical. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with varying degrees of suspicion regarding the package name. Malware scores are appropriately zero; obfuscation scores vary but should be moderate given the name; risk scores are low, reflecting the static and benign nature of the code. No evidence of malicious intent or harmful behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with an obfuscated package name that warrants attention but does not constitute malicious activity. Scores should reflect no malware (0), moderate obfuscation (~0.2-0.5), and low security risk (~0.1). The overall assessment confirms the package is safe but the name's obscurity should be noted for further review if part of a larger supply chain.",
