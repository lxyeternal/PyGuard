{
  "purpose": "The code appears to collect system information and uptime, then send this data over a network connection during package installation.",
  "sources": "Reads from '/proc/uptime' and system platform information; socket connection to external IP 134.209.85.64 on port 9090.",
  "sinks": "Socket.send() method transmitting collected data to an external IP address.",
  "flows": "Reads system uptime and details -> formats data -> connects to external server -> sends data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded IP address for data exfiltration; connection initiated during package installation; reading system uptime from '/proc/uptime' which is Linux-specific; obfuscated variable names and code structure.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and defines functions to gather system information, including uptime, OS details, and IP address. It then creates a socket connection to a hardcoded IP and port, sending the gathered data. The data is transmitted during the installation process of a package named 'tk7cnhs1jtuhardc' via a custom install class that invokes this function. The hardcoded IP and network activity during package installation are suspicious, indicating potential malicious data exfiltration or backdoor activity. The obfuscation through variable naming and structure further suggests malicious intent or concealment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is potentially malicious, performing unauthorized data collection and exfiltration during package installation. It communicates with an external IP address, which is suspicious behavior for a Python package. The code exhibits obfuscation and unconventional behavior, indicating malicious intent.",
