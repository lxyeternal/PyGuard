  "purpose": "The code appears to gather system information and send it to a remote server during package installation.",
  "sources": "Reading system uptime from /proc/uptime; gathering platform and network information; socket connection to remote IP.",
  "sinks": "Sending data over socket connection to IP 134.209.85.64 on port 9090.",
  "flows": "Read uptime -> compile system info -> connect to remote IP -> send system info data.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded IP address and port for data exfiltration; code is embedded in an installation script, potentially without user awareness; obfuscated variable names; function name is non-descriptive.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that reads system uptime from /proc/uptime, gathers platform and IP info, then opens a socket connection to a specific IP address and port to transmit the gathered information. It is invoked during the package's installation process via a custom setup command class. The obfuscated variable names and hardcoded IP suggest an attempt to conceal malicious activity. The code does not perform any legitimate installation tasks but instead secretly exfiltrates system details.",
  "conclusion": "The script is designed to covertly send system information to a remote server during package installation, indicating malicious behavior likely aimed at data exfiltration. The use of obfuscation and hardcoded IP strongly suggest malicious intent.",
