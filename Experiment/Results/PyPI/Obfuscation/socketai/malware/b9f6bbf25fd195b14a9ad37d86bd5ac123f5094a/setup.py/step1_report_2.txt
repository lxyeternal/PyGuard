{
  "purpose": "The code appears to collect system information and uptime, then transmit this data to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Reads system uptime from /proc/uptime; uses socket to get hostname IP; imports platform, socket, os, pty; reads system info via platform module.",
  "sinks": "Sends collected data over socket connection to a hardcoded IP address (134.209.85.64:9090).",
  "flows": "Reads system uptime -> Collects system info -> Constructs message -> Connects to remote IP -> Sends data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded IP address for data exfiltration; connection initiated during package installation via overridden install class method; no validation or encryption of data transmitted; obfuscated function and variable names; code runs on installation without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that reads system uptime from /proc/uptime, formats it, gathers system details such as OS and IP address, and then establishes a socket connection to a remote server at 134.209.85.64 on port 9090, sending the collected data. This function is invoked during the package's installation process through a custom install command class. The presence of hardcoded IP, the unsolicited connection during setup, and obfuscated naming suggest malicious intent or at least unauthorized data exfiltration. There are no apparent safeguards, validation, or encryption, raising security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The package includes hidden malicious behavior—collecting system information and transmitting it to an external server without user consent—indicating potential malicious activity. The code is intentionally obfuscated with misleading variable names and triggers during installation, which is suspicious. Overall, it poses a security risk.",
