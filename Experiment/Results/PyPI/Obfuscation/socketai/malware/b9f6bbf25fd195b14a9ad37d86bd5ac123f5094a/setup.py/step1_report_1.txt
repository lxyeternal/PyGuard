{
  "purpose": "The code appears to gather system information such as uptime and OS details, then sends this data over a network connection to a specific IP address, possibly for monitoring or malicious data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Reads system uptime from '/proc/uptime', retrieves platform and IP information, and reads system details via socket functions.",
  "sinks": "Sends collected data to IP address '134.209.85.64' on port 9090 using a socket connection.",
  "flows": "Reads system info -> formats data -> connects to remote server -> transmits data.",
  "anomalies": "The code openly transmits system uptime and OS info to a remote server without user consent or obvious purpose; the hardcoded IP and port suggest potential data exfiltration. The code structure is obfuscated with seemingly random function and variable names, indicating an attempt to hide intent. The use of socket connection and data transmission to an external IP without context is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries but uses them in an unusual manner, notably reading '/proc/uptime' for system uptime and sending this info over a socket to an external IP address. The function JoPoNsZuQfYCJoMAteyUYoXWGWEZvGBd() collects system info and transmits it without any user interaction. The class extending 'install' hooks this function into the package installation process, which executes upon package installation. This behavior resembles data exfiltration or potentially malicious system reconnaissance. No code appears to be obfuscated in a typical sense, but variable and function names are deliberately nonsensical, which might be a tactic to evade casual review. There are no other suspicious libraries or dangerous commands beyond data collection and transmission.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to collect system uptime and OS details and send this information to an external IP address during package installation. This behavior could be malicious, aimed at surveillance or data exfiltration. The obfuscated style and network activity are indicators of potentially malicious intent. Therefore, this package should be considered suspicious and potentially malicious.",
