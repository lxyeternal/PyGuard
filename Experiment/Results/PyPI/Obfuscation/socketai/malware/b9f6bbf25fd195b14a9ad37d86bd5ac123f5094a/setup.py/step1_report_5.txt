{
  "purpose": "The code appears to collect system uptime and system information, then send this data over a network connection to a remote server during installation of a package.",
  "sources": "Reads from /proc/uptime, platform module for system info, socket module for network communication.",
  "sinks": "Socket connection to IP 134.209.85.64 on port 9090 and sending data over it.",
  "flows": "System info is gathered, formatted, then transmitted to a remote server via socket during package installation.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual code flow: data collection and transmission occurs during package install. The remote server communication is hidden inside a setup script, which is suspicious. No use of cryptographic verification or user notification.",
  "analysis": "The script defines functions to read system uptime from /proc/uptime, gather platform info, and send this data over a socket to a specific IP address. It hooks into the package installation process, executing during setup. The data transmission to a hardcoded external IP is suspicious, potentially exfiltrating system information without user consent. The code does not perform any validation, encryption, or logging to hide its activity. There are no other suspicious or malicious behaviors such as command execution, backdoors, or data theft beyond system info exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious intent by collecting system data and sending it to a remote server during package installation without user knowledge or consent. The remote communication and data exfiltration are clear indicators of potentially malicious behavior, possibly for tracking or malicious monitoring purposes.",
