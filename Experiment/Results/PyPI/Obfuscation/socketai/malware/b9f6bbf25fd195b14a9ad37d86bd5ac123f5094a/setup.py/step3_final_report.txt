  "purpose": "The code collects system uptime and system information, then exfiltrates this data to a remote server during package installation, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Reads from '/proc/uptime', gathers platform info via 'platform' module, retrieves IP via socket.gethostbyname(socket.gethostname())",
  "sinks": "Socket connection to '134.209.85.64' on port 9090, sending encoded system info data",
  "flows": "Source: '/proc/uptime' and system info variables -> Function assembling data -> Socket connect -> Data sent to external IP",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names, execution during setup, hardcoded external IP, data exfiltration without user consent",
  "analysis": "The code reads system uptime and info, constructs a string with this data, and transmits it over a socket to a hardcoded IP during package installation. Variable names are nonsensical, indicating obfuscation. The behavior is suspicious, as it exfiltrates data without user knowledge. The network activity and obfuscation strongly suggest malicious intent. The code does not perform any legitimate installation tasks beyond this data transmission. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.8-0.9, obfuscated ~0.6-0.8, risk ~0.8-0.9) are justified given the behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by covertly collecting and transmitting system information during package installation. The obfuscation and hardcoded IP further support malicious intent. It should be classified as highly malicious with high security risk.",
