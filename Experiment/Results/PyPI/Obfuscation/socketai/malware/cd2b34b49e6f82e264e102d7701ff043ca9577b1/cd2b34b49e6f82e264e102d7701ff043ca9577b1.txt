      "conclusion": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and suspicious metadata, indicating potential malicious intent or malicious-like obfuscation. While no direct malicious payload is visible, the indicators warrant further scrutiny before deployment. The overall security risk is high, and the package should be examined in a controlled environment."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits classic signs of malicious obfuscation and dynamic execution, strongly indicating malicious intent. The high use of eval(), base64 decoding, and external references, combined with silent error suppression, justify a high malware and security risk score. It should be treated as highly suspicious and potentially harmful."
