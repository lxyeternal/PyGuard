  "purpose": "Web scraper targeting yiff-party.com to extract image URLs across categories, including latest, random, and streaming features.",
  "sources": "HTTP GET requests to category URLs, parsing HTML content with BeautifulSoup, extracting 'data-src' attributes from 'img' tags.",
  "sinks": "Returns or yields image URLs; no malicious sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Request to URL -> parse HTML -> find 'img' tags -> extract 'data-src' -> return or yield URLs.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with nonsensical variable names, inconsistent variable naming, use of undefined variable 'pageNUM', presence of unused import 'tests', potential infinite loops with sleep, and adult content scraping.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward web scraping with obfuscation likely intended to conceal intent but does not contain malicious payloads, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The main risks are resource exhaustion due to infinite loops and potential policy issues related to adult content. The obfuscation is significant but not malicious in itself. The undefined 'pageNUM' is a bug, not malicious. No evidence of data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated adult content scraper with no active malicious intent. The primary concerns are resource usage and obfuscation, not malware. Malware score remains 0; obfuscation is high (~0.75); overall security risk is low (~0.35).",
