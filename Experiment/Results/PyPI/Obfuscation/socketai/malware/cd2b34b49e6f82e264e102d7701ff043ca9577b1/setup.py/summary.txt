  "conclusion": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and suspicious metadata, indicating potential malicious intent or malicious-like obfuscation. While no direct malicious payload is visible, the indicators warrant further scrutiny before deployment. The overall security risk is high, and the package should be examined in a controlled environment."
