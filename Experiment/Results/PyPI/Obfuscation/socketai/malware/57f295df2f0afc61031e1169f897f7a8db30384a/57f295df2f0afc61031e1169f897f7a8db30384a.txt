      "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and likely malicious, designed to conceal activities such as privilege escalation, package installation, and system modifications. Its obfuscation and system interactions are consistent with malware or sabotage payloads. It warrants high severity and should be flagged for further static and dynamic analysis."

      "conclusion": "The dependency code shows no definitive malicious behavior. Obfuscation in Report 1 warrants a moderate suspicion score, but no actual malware is present. The overall security posture is considered benign, with scores reflecting the current evidence. Continuous monitoring is recommended for obfuscation patterns in future reviews."
