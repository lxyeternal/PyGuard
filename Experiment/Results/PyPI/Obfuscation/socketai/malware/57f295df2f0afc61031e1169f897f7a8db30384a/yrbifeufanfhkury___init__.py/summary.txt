  "conclusion": "The dependency code shows no definitive malicious behavior. Obfuscation in Report 1 warrants a moderate suspicion score, but no actual malware is present. The overall security posture is considered benign, with scores reflecting the current evidence. Continuous monitoring is recommended for obfuscation patterns in future reviews."
