  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code segments involving environment variables, network/file operations, dynamic execution, and potential data leaks.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows to network connections, file writes, environment variables, or dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or input functions flow into processing functions, possibly reaching sinks like network or file I/O.",
  "anomalies": "Signs of obfuscation, dynamic execution, complex variable naming, and hardcoded values without explicit malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation in Report 1, including complex variable names and dynamic execution functions, but no concrete malicious payloads are present. Reports 2-5 show minimal or benign code with no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the observed signs—higher obfuscation in Report 1 justifies a score of 0.7, while others are low or zero. No evidence of malicious activity or sabotage is detected across all reports. The overall security risk remains low, with cautious suspicion due to obfuscation in Report 1.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency code shows no definitive malicious behavior. Obfuscation in Report 1 warrants a moderate suspicion score, but no actual malware is present. The overall security posture is considered benign, with scores reflecting the current evidence. Continuous monitoring is recommended for obfuscation patterns in future reviews.",
