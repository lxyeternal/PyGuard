{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for data processing and possibly network communication, but the specific intent is unclear without further context.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, file inputs, and possibly user inputs via function parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes to files, sends data over network sockets, or logs information.",
  "flows": "Data from environment variables or user inputs flows into processing functions, then potentially to network or file outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscation, or unusual code constructs detected. Usage of standard libraries without unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code reads inputs from environment variables and files, processes data via functions, and has code segments that handle network or file outputs. There is no evidence of malicious data handling, hidden backdoors, or suspicious network activity. No obfuscation or malicious payloads detected. The structure appears typical of a data processing script, with clear separation between data sources and sinks.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit signs of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. It appears to be a legitimate data processing script without malicious intent.",
