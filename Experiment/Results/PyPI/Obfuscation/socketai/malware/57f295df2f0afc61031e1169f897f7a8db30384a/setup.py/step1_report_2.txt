    "Complex, meaningless arithmetic calculations used to determine control flow or variable values",
    "Repeated use of dynamically constructed string commands using map, getattr, oct, hex, and complex expressions",

    "Use of ctypes.windll and win32com, which can be used for advanced system interactions and may indicate malicious persistence or privilege escalation"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code is heavily obfuscated with meaningless variable names and complex arithmetic expressions designed to hinder understanding. It reads command-line arguments and system environment variables to control execution paths, often involving dynamic module imports (pip, os, win32com, ctypes). There are multiple conditional branches that perform system modifications such as creating shortcuts, directories, and checking admin privileges. The code attempts to run commands via pip, manipulate files, and check for administrative privileges, which are typical behaviors of malware aiming to install or escalate privileges, persist, or exfiltrate data. The obfuscation is consistent throughout, and the logic appears to conceal malicious intents such as executing arbitrary commands, installing packages without user consent, or modifying system files.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is highly obfuscated with intentionally complex and confusing logic designed to hide malicious behaviors. It can perform system modifications, install or update packages, and check for administrative rights, all indicators of potentially malicious intent. The use of dynamic imports, environmental checks, file manipulations, and system privilege checks strongly suggest malicious or sabotage behavior. The code warrants extreme caution and should not be used or executed in production environments.",
