  "conclusion": "The code is a typical PyArmor obfuscated wrapper with encrypted payloads intended for code protection. No direct malicious activity is evident, but the encrypted data could conceal malicious code. Static analysis alone cannot confirm malicious intent; further dynamic or deobfuscation analysis is recommended. The risk and malware scores are appropriately cautious, especially in the context of encrypted payloads."
