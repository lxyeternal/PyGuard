{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility function, but without seeing the actual code, the exact intent cannot be determined.",
  "sources": "The code likely reads input from function arguments, user input, environment variables, or file I/O based on standard patterns.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include network calls, file writes, or execution functions if untrusted data is handled improperly.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks via processing functions, which could be exploited if inputs are not sanitized.",
  "anomalies": "No specific anomalies can be identified without actual code. Watch for hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual control flows.",
  "analysis": "Unable to perform detailed analysis due to lack of code. Normally, would examine for malicious patterns such as data exfiltration, network connections to suspicious domains, or code that manipulates system files. Verify the use of trusted libraries and check for unsafe practices like eval or exec with untrusted input.",
  "conclusion": "Insufficient information to definitively identify malicious behavior. No overt malicious indicators visible without actual code content. Recommendations include reviewing the specific code for common security issues and ensuring dependencies are trustworthy.",
