{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a malicious Python package designed to exfiltrate environment data, SSH keys, and environment variables, and to communicate with a remote server controlled by an attacker.",
  "sources": "Data sources include environment variables, local environment files (*.env), and SSH private keys (id_rsa). It also reads content from potentially sensitive files on Windows drives and home directories.",
  "sinks": "Data is encoded in base64 and sent via HTTP requests using 'curl' to a remote URL controlled by the attacker. It also attempts to access and read sensitive files and environment variables, then transmits this data remotely.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables and local files feed into encoding routines, then the encoded data is sent over network requests to external URLs. For example, environment data and private keys are read, encoded, and transmitted to 'http://bellazik.000webhostapp.com:443'.",
  "anomalies": "The code is obfuscated through dynamic variable names, uses base64 encoding, and constructs URLs with undefined variables ('URL', 'dotenv', 'environs', 'home_path', 'privkey') which may be placeholders or obfuscated. It uses subprocess to execute system commands, including PowerShell on Windows and 'find' on Unix-like systems, to locate environment files. The code also defines classes extending 'develop' and 'install' commands, executing malicious functions during package setup or development commands.",
  "analysis": "The script imports modules and defines functions that harvest sensitive data such as environment variables, SSH private keys, and environment files. It encodes this data and exfiltrates it via HTTP requests using 'curl'. It leverages platform-specific commands to locate files, indicating adaptability. The code is embedded within custom setuptools command classes, ensuring execution during package installation or development setup. Variable names and URL references are obfuscated or placeholders, consistent with malicious intent. Overall, the code demonstrates techniques typical of malware aiming to steal credentials and system info stealthily.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code exhibits clear malicious intent, primarily to exfiltrate sensitive system and environment data to a remote attacker-controlled server. Its obfuscation, use of system commands to locate secrets, and integration into package setup routines strongly suggest it is malicious software embedded within a seemingly benign package. The overall security risk is high.",
