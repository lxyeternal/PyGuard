  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated due to the absence of code content, making it difficult to determine the intent.",
  "sources": "No input sources such as user input, environment variables, or data files are evident in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "There are no clear sink points where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or system effects; no network connections, file writes, or command executions are visible.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are identifiable, as the code appears empty or minimal.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no unusual patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs; it is essentially empty or placeholder.",
  "analysis": "The provided code fragment is empty or contains no executable statements, so there is no operational logic, data flow, or potential security concern to analyze. The absence of code limits the ability to assess security or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, or possibly incomplete. Without additional code or context, no malicious activity or security issues can be identified.",
