  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Code snippets, code presence (or absence), data flow points, suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation indicators.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network connections, system modifications, insecure operations, malicious functions.",
  "flows": "Data sources (inputs, environment variables) to sinks (network, file system, system calls).",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, suspicious network activity, malicious system modifications, unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify the presence or absence of code and evaluate risks accordingly. The malware scores are consistently zero, aligning with the lack of malicious indicators. Security risk scores are low (~0.2), reflecting cautious assessment of benign code. Confidence levels are appropriate given the information; higher confidence in reports with actual code, lower where code is absent. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious functions are identified across reports. The scores are justified and internally consistent, with no logical discrepancies. Minor adjustments could be made for reports with no code, setting risk to 0, but the current conservative score (0.2) remains acceptable.",
  "conclusion": "The provided reports are accurate and consistent with their assessments. All indicate minimal or no security concerns, with scores appropriately reflecting the benign nature of the code snippets. No further action or revisions are necessary.",
  "model": "gpt-4.1-nano"
