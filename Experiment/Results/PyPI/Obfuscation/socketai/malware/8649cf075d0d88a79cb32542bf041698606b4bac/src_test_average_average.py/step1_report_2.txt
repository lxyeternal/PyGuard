{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a simple function for calculating the integer mean of a list and another function returning a static string.",
  "sources": "Input list 'li' for the 'pMNZTXHMcwYTPnOubvYQvVPGZYzIgBwm' function",
  "sinks": "No evident data sinks or untrusted data handling beyond the list input; no network or file operations.",
  "flows": "Input list 'li' flows into the sum and length functions in 'pMNZTXHMcwYTPnOubvYQvVPGZYzIgBwm' and returns the static string in 'EFBGQbtwqWfkuYSyuEVRsAvUdAacogwQ'.",
  "anomalies": "Function names are obfuscated and do not indicate clear purpose; no usage of environment variables, secrets, or suspicious constructs; no obfuscated or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two functions. The first computes the integer division of the sum of a list by its length, which is a straightforward statistical operation. The second function returns a fixed string 'lol'. There are no external data sources, network calls, or system modifications. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic present. The obfuscated function names might suggest hiding intent, but no malicious activity is evident. Overall, the code appears benign and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs simple calculations and returns a static string with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscated function names do not indicate malicious intent but could be for concealment. Overall, no malicious activity is detected.",
