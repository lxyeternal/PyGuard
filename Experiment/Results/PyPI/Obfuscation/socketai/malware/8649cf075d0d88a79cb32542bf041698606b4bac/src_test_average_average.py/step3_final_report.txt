{
  "purpose": "The code defines two functions: one calculates the integer average of a list, and the other returns a static string 'lol'.",
  "sources": "Input source is the parameter 'li' for the first function; no external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data leaks; no network or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the input list 'li' to the sum and division operations within the first function; no external or untrusted data flows are involved.",
  "anomalies": "Function names are obfuscated and nonsensical, but operations are simple and benign. No malicious patterns or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward calculations and returns a static string, with obfuscated function names but no malicious intent. No external data or network activity is involved. The obfuscation is superficial and does not imply malicious behavior. The malware score should be 0, as there is no evidence of malicious activity. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to obfuscation, so a low score (~0.1) is appropriate. Confidence in this assessment is high (0.9), given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malware detected. Obfuscation is superficial and does not elevate risk. The scores are consistent with the analysis, with malware score at 0, obfuscation at 0.8, and overall security risk at 0.1.",

  "obfuscated": 0.8,
