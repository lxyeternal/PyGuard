{
  "purpose": "The code appears to provide a simple averaging function and a trivial function returning a string, with no clear purpose or context.",
  "sources": "The code reads input via the parameter 'li' in the 'pMNZTXHMcwYTPnOubvYQvVPGZYzIgBwm' function.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or places where untrusted data leads to data leaks, system effects, or external communications.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the input parameter 'li' in the averaging function, but no further data flow or output is observed. The second function does not use or process any input.",
  "anomalies": "The function names are nonsensical and do not describe their purpose, indicating obfuscation or auto-generated code. There are no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code contains two functions: one performs an integer division average of a list, and the other returns a fixed string. No data is transmitted externally, no code injection, environment variables, or unsafe operations are present. The function names are obfuscated, but this alone does not indicate malicious intent. The overall structure is simple and does not exhibit malware characteristics or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security threats. The obfuscated function names suggest possible obfuscation, but the code itself performs harmless operations.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.8,
