{
  "purpose": "The code appears to implement a simple averaging function and a trivial function returning a static string.",
  "sources": "The function 'pMNZTXHMcwYTPnOubvYQvVPGZYzIgBwm' reads input via its parameter 'li', which is expected to be a list of numbers. The other function 'EFBGQbtwqWfkuYSyuEVRsAvUdAacogwQ' does not read external data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there are no operations that send data externally, write to files, or network connections.",
  "flows": "Input list 'li' flows into the averaging function, which computes a sum and division, but this is a safe numerical operation with no external effects. The string-returning function does not process input.",
  "anomalies": "Function names are obfuscated and non-descriptive, which can be a tactic to hide malicious intent. However, the code itself is simple and does not perform any malicious actions. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code contains two functions: one calculates the average of a list of numbers, and the other returns a static string 'lol'. The first function uses basic operations and appears safe, with no signs of data leakage or malicious behavior. The second function does not use or manipulate external data. The obfuscated function names might suggest intent to hide, but the implementation is benign. There are no external data flows, network activity, or other malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple, benign, and does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscated names alone are not sufficient to conclude malicious intent, given the benign content.",
