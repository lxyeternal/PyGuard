{
  "purpose": "The code provides a simple function to compute the integer mean of a list and another function returning a string 'lol'.",
  "sources": "The function 'pMNZTXHMcwYTPnOubvYQvVPGZYzIgBwm' reads the input list 'li' to calculate the mean.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data leaks are present; no untrusted data is processed for output or external communication.",
  "flows": "Input 'li' flows into the sum and length functions within 'pMNZTXHMcwYTPnOubvYQvVPGZYzIgBwm' to produce a result.",
  "anomalies": "The function names are nonsensical and obfuscated; the second function simply returns a string without apparent purpose or context. No hidden code or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two functions: one computes the integer average of a list, which is a basic operation, and the other returns a static string 'lol'. There are no external data reads, no data transmissions, and no use of environment variables or insecure operations. The function names appear obfuscated but do not indicate malicious intent. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious activities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscated naming may suggest an attempt to conceal code intent, but the actual code functions are simple and harmless.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.8,
