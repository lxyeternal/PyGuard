{
  "purpose": "The code provides a simple average function and a function returning a fixed string, with no clear application or context.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'li' in the function pMNZTXHMcwYTPnOubvYQvVPGZYzIgBwm",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks; the functions do not process or output untrusted data or perform any network or file operations.",
  "flows": "Input 'li' flows into the average calculation in pMNZTXHMcwYTPnOubvYQvVPGZYzIgBwm, but the output is a benign integer; no further flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "The function names are nonsensical, but they do not perform any suspicious operations. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated parts.",
  "analysis": "The script defines two functions: one calculates the integer mean of a list, and the other returns a fixed string 'lol'. There are no external data sources, no network activity, and no manipulation of environment variables or system state. The naming appears obfuscated but does not imply malicious intent. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. It seems to be a simple utility with obfuscated naming, but no malicious payloads or dangerous behaviors are present.",
