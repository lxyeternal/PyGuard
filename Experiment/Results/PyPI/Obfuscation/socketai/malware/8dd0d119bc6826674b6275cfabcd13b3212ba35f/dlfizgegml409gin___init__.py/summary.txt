  "conclusion": "The code is highly malicious, designed for credential theft, data exfiltration, and potential network attacks. Despite syntax issues, its core behaviors confirm malicious intent. The malware score should be approximately 0.95, with a high security risk (~0.95), and moderate obfuscation (~0.8). It warrants classification as a severe threat."
