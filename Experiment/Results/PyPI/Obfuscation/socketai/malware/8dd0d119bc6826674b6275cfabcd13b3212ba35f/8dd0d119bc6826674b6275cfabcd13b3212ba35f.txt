      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with superficial obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The obfuscation does not indicate malicious intent but may be used to evade static analysis. Overall, the script is safe and suitable for use."

      "conclusion": "The code is highly malicious, designed for credential theft, data exfiltration, and potential network attacks. Despite syntax issues, its core behaviors confirm malicious intent. The malware score should be approximately 0.95, with a high security risk (~0.95), and moderate obfuscation (~0.8). It warrants classification as a severe threat."
