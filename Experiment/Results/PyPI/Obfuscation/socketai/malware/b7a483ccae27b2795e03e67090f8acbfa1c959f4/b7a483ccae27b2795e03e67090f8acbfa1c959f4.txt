It should be classified as malware with a malware score of 0.9, high obfuscation (0.9), and a security risk of 0.9. Usage of this package poses a significant security threat and should be avoided."

The obfuscation and suspicious function call raise some concern but do not provide evidence of malicious activity. The current scores are appropriate; malware score should be set to 0.2, obfuscation high at 0.8, and overall risk moderate at 0.3."

      "conclusion": "The code is primarily benign, performing simple colored output with obfuscation techniques that raise suspicion but do not confirm malicious intent. No active malicious behavior is evident. The obfuscation warrants caution, but the code itself does not pose an immediate threat. Scores should reflect low malware risk (~0.1), high obfuscation (~0.8), and moderate overall risk (~0.3). Further environment analysis is recommended."
