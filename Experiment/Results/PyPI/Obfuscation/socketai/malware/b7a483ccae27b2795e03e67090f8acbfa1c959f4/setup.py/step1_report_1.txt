{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, including custom installation behavior, and functions for reading files and extracting version information.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from files using open() calls and from HTTP requests via urllib2.urlopen().",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include execution of decoded base64 code, and making an HTTP request to a suspicious URL.",
  "flows": "Base64-decoded code executes dynamically, possibly retrieving and executing remote code; HTTP request fetches data from 'https://grabify.link/E09EIF'. Reading local files occurs for version info and other file contents.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains obfuscated base64-encoded string that, when decoded, executes further code, which is suspicious. It makes a request to a suspicious URL, and uses dynamic code execution (exec on decoded string). Use of string decoding, dynamic import, and obfuscated code suggests potential malicious intent. The variable names are nonsensical and obfuscated. The URL 'grabify.link' is known for hosting tracking or malicious links.",
  "analysis": "The script imports numerous modules, some redundantly, and defines a custom installation class that executes code decoded from base64, which likely contains malicious or tracking behavior. The code makes a network request to a suspicious URL and executes code embedded within the base64 string. File-reading functions are standard but could be used to read sensitive files if misused. The obfuscated code, combined with network activity and dynamic execution, strongly indicates malicious intent, possibly to execute remote code or exfiltrate data. The presence of a hardcoded URL and obfuscated payloads confirms malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains obfuscated, dynamically executed code that contacts a suspicious URL, indicating high likelihood of malicious intent. It exhibits traits typical of malware, including remote code execution, obfuscation, and communication with potentially malicious sites. The overall security risk is high, and usage of this package should be avoided.",
