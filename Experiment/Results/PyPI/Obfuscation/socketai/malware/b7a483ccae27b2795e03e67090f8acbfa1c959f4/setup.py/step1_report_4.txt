{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, including functions to read files and extract version information, along with a class that executes obfuscated code during installation.",
  "sources": "Data is read from files in the local directory, and network requests are made to 'https://grabify.link/E09EIF'.",
  "sinks": "The network request could potentially send data externally. The execution of decoded base64 code in the install class is a significant sink that could run malicious code.",
  "flows": "The script fetches data from the network, decodes it, and executes it via 'exec' during installation. It also reads local files and processes their contents, possibly for versioning or configuration.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains obfuscated base64-encoded payload executed with 'exec', which is suspicious. The network request to a suspicious link and execution of dynamically decoded code during package installation are abnormal behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and third-party libraries. It defines an install class that executes a base64-decoded payload via 'exec', which is a common obfuscation technique often associated with malicious activity. The payload itself, when decoded, involves network communication to 'grabify.link', a domain associated with tracking or malicious purposes. The script reads files relative to its location, which could be used to gather system info or read sensitive data, but no direct evidence of malicious data exfiltration is shown. The setup configuration appears standard, with normal package metadata and dependencies, but the obfuscated code and network request during install are high-risk indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated payload execution and a request to a suspicious domain during installation, which are strong indicators of malicious intent. The rest of the setup code appears standard, but the dynamic execution and network activity are concerning and should prevent safe usage.",
