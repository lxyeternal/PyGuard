  "purpose": "This script appears to be a setup/configuration script for a Python package named 'jdjdm08mnxwejvnw', including custom installation behavior.",
  "sources": "Reading of system information via platform.system(); fetching data from a remote URL ('https://grabify.link/E09EIF'); reading local files based on provided filenames; extracting version string from file content.",
  "sinks": "Network request to external URL, potential data exfiltration; reading local files; executing code decoded from base64 string.",
  "flows": "System info (platform.system()) is used to set headers in network request; network response is stored in variable 'BkYFPzwDuNojwQNYFnXphnGRnuwRiAPo'; local file reading functions access local files; version extraction involves regex search on file contents.",
  "anomalies": "Decoded base64 string contains obfuscated code that performs network requests and executes encoded code; use of obscure variable names; fetching data from 'grabify.link', which is often used for tracking or malicious purposes; dynamic code execution with exec() on decoded base64 payload; lack of clear legitimate purpose for network request and decoded code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports multiple modules, including standard and third-party, with some redundancy. It decodes a base64 payload that, when decoded, performs network operations and possibly executes further code via exec(). It makes a request to 'grabify.link', a known tracking/monitoring service, with the user agent set dynamically based on platform.system(). The code contains obfuscated and potentially malicious behavior, especially considering the URL and use of exec() on decoded code. The setup configuration seems legitimate, but the presence of obfuscated payloads and external requests indicates suspicious activity. The functions for reading local files and extracting version strings appear benign, but their purpose within this context is unclear and possibly malicious if used to read sensitive files.\n",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated payload that fetches and executes remote code, uses a suspicious URL ('grabify.link'), and employs obfuscation techniques. The base64-encoded payload and dynamic execution strongly suggest malicious intent, likely for data exfiltration or remote command execution. Overall, this package shows signs of malicious behavior, with a malware score likely in the 0.75-1 range and security risk score indicating high danger.",
