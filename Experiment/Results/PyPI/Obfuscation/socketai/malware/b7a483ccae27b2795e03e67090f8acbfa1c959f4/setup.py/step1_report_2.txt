{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package named 'jdjdm08mnxwejvnw', including custom installation behavior that executes embedded code during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from an external URL ('https://grabify.link/E09EIF') via urllib2, reads files from the local filesystem (via functions like qyTLvSCiaDYiGiwnSJKcEwFbbEjFmelG and TwHIpzRhWIqasZEcrztrLRWEcATsnQDr), and decodes a base64-encoded string containing embedded Python code.",
  "sinks": "Execution of dynamically decoded code via 'exec' from the base64 string; network request to an external domain; reading files from local filesystem.",
  "flows": "The code performs a network request to fetch data, then decodes and executes embedded code dynamically. File reading functions access local files, potentially using untrusted data if filenames are influenced externally.",
  "anomalies": "The embedded base64-encoded string, when decoded, contains a large chunk of code that performs network communication, executes code via 'exec', and contains obfuscated variable names. The code fetches data from an external URL and executes code at runtime, which is highly suspicious and typical of malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with obfuscated and base64-encoded code executed via 'exec'. This code makes a request to an external link and reads its response. The code then sets platform-specific variables and includes functions for reading local files. The presence of a large base64 string decoded into code that performs network requests and executes code dynamically is a major red flag. The setup configuration itself appears normal, but the embedded code execution indicates malicious intent. The code seems designed to run payloads fetched from the internet during installation, which could include malware or backdoors. The obfuscation and dynamic code execution strongly suggest malicious intent, potentially allowing remote code execution or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, dynamically executed code that fetches and executes external data during installation, representing high malicious risk. The setup script appears normal on the surface but hides malicious behavior within the embedded payload. It is highly likely to be malicious malware designed to compromise systems during package installation.",
