{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script that, during installation, decodes and executes obfuscated remote code, and contacts a suspicious URL ('grabify.link') to fetch additional payloads or data.",
  "sources": "The base64-encoded string decoded in the exec payload, network request to 'https://grabify.link/E09EIF', and local file reads for version info.",
  "sinks": "The 'exec' of decoded code, network request to a malicious domain, and file I/O operations that could be manipulated or used maliciously.",
  "flows": "Decoded base64 payload flows into 'exec', which executes remote code; network request flows from code to 'grabify.link'; file reads supply version info; obfuscated variables mask malicious intent.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, base64-encoded payload decoded and executed dynamically, network request to a known malicious/tracking domain, use of 'exec' on decoded code, and multiple layers of obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script is a malicious setup component that decodes an obfuscated payload, executes it dynamically, and contacts a suspicious URL during installation. The obfuscation and remote code execution are classic indicators of malware. The network request to 'grabify.link' is a strong sign of malicious intent, likely for data exfiltration or remote command control. The code's structure and behavior align with known malicious supply chain attacks, with high confidence in its malicious nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious intent, including remote code execution, obfuscation, and contact with a known malicious domain. It should be classified as malware with a malware score of 0.9, high obfuscation (0.9), and a security risk of 0.9. Usage of this package poses a significant security threat and should be avoided.",
