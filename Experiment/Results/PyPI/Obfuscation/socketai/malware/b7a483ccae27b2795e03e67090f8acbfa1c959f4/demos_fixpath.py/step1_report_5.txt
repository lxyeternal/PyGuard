  "flows": "Reading __file__ -> Computing parent directory -> Modifying sys.path",
  "anomalies": "Use of a non-descriptive variable name for the path, and dynamic path computation; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code computes the parent directory of the current script using os.path functions, then inserts this path at the start of sys.path to influence module import order. No user input, environment variables, or network activity involved. The purpose appears to be to ensure local modules in the parent directory can be imported more easily. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or data leaks are present. The code is straightforward, with no suspicious or obfuscated logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply modifies the Python import path to include the parent directory. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks, and appears to be a standard way to adjust module lookup paths.",
