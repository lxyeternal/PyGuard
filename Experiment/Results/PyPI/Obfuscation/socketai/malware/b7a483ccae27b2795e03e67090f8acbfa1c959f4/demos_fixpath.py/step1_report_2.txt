  "purpose": "The code modifies the Python module search path to include the parent directory of the current file.",
  "sources": "Reading the __file__ variable to determine the current script location",
  "sinks": "sys.path.insert to add a directory to the module search path",
  "flows": "From __file__ → os.path functions to determine parent directory → sys.path.insert to add directory to search path",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable name 'KsIhFGsonvNNoOTZcmFLYhJDYNMbRMre' which appears unnecessarily complex and could be intended to obscure intent; no other suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code calculates the parent directory of the current script and prepends it to sys.path. This is a common pattern for modifying module search paths dynamically, often used for local imports. The variable name is unusually complex, which could be an attempt to hide or obscure the variable's purpose, but the logic itself is benign. No code injection, no data leakage, no external network activity, or malicious file operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard, benign operation of adjusting the module search path with an obfuscated variable name. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
