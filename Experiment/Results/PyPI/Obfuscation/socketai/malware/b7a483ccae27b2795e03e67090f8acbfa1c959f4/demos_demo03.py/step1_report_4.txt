  "purpose": "The code demonstrates usage of the colourama library to print colored text with different reset behaviors for terminal styling.",
  "sources": "Imports from colourama library; use of input variables for printing",
  "sinks": "Print statements which output colored text to the terminal",
  "flows": "Imported colourama functions and variables are used directly in print statements to generate colored output",
  "anomalies": "Use of seemingly obfuscated or random variable and function names from colourama; no actual user input or untrusted data; no hardcoded secrets; no dynamic code execution or network activity",
  "analysis": "The script imports specific classes or functions with obfuscated names from the colourama library, then uses them to print concatenated strings with color formatting. The code comments describe the behavior of the reset parameter. There are no input sources that handle untrusted data, nor any sinks that transmit data externally. The usage appears to be a demonstration or test of colourama's behavior with the autoreset parameter. No suspicious or malicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The obfuscated names seem to serve as an obstacle to readability but do not indicate malicious intent. The code's purpose appears benign, with no evidence of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward demonstration of colourama's colored output capabilities with different reset settings. No malicious activity, security risks, or suspicious behavior are detected. The obfuscated variable names are likely an attempt at obfuscation but do not impact security.",
