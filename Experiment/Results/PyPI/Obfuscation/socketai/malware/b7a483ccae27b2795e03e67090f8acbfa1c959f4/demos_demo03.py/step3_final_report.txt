{
  "purpose": "Demonstrates the use of the 'colourama' library to print colored text with different 'autoreset' settings, illustrating terminal color management.",
  "sources": "Static import statements, predefined color codes, and print statements with concatenated color codes and strings.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources; no external data, network, or file system interactions; output is static and controlled.",
  "flows": "Color code variables are concatenated with static strings and printed; no external or untrusted data flows involved.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated variable and function names (e.g., DuDewYTfsluHwvQCHqhpoqFeLzjetrJN), which could be an attempt to hide code simplicity or intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports from 'colourama' with obfuscated identifiers, sets 'autoreset' to True and False, and prints strings with color codes. No untrusted input, network activity, or malicious logic is present. The obfuscation appears stylistic rather than malicious. The code's purpose is benign, serving as a demonstration of color reset behavior. No security vulnerabilities, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are detected. The obfuscation justifies high obfuscation scores, but malware scores remain zero. The overall security risk is minimal, primarily due to obfuscation but with no actual threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign demonstration of 'colourama' with heavily obfuscated variable names. No malicious activity, data exfiltration, or security issues are present. The obfuscation does not imply malicious intent, and the overall security assessment remains very low risk.",
