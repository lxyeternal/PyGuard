{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates usage of the colourama library to print colored text with different auto-reset settings.",
  "sources": "Imports from colourama library, reading functions and constants for terminal coloring.",
  "sinks": "Print statements that output colored text, which could potentially be manipulated if input were untrusted, but in this context they only output static concatenated strings.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data sources are present. The code sets color configuration and then prints strings with color formatting applied. No flow of untrusted input to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated import names (e.g., DuDewYTfsluHwvQCHqhpoqFeLzjetrJN), but these are consistent with normal import statements. No hardcoded credentials or secrets detected. No suspicious or malicious code behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module with an unusual name from the colourama package, which is used to manage terminal text colors. It applies different reset behaviors (autoreset=True and autoreset=False) and prints strings with concatenated color formatting codes. The string concatenations are static and do not involve any untrusted input. The obfuscated import names could be an attempt to hide code intent, but given their use as typical colourama functions and constants, they appear legitimate. There are no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign demonstration of colourama's color reset functionality. There is no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. The obfuscated naming could be suspicious but does not inherently indicate malware. Overall, the code is safe based on the provided fragment.",
