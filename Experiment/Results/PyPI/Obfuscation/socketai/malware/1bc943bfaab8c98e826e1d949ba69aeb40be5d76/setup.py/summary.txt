  "security_risk": 0.85,
  "obfuscated": 0.8,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during setup, which aligns with common malware tactics. The broad error suppression and silent execution increase suspicion. The scores assigned are justified, and the overall security risk is high. It should be treated as malicious or at least highly suspicious pending further payload decoding."
