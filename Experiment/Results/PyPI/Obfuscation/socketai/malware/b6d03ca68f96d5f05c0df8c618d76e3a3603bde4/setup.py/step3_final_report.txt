{
  "purpose": "Detects execution of an obfuscated, silent PowerShell payload during package setup, indicating potential malicious activity.",
  "sources": "Checks for directory 'tahg'; executes encoded PowerShell command via subprocess if not present.",
  "sinks": "Execution of encoded PowerShell command with hidden window, potentially leading to malicious payload execution.",
  "flows": "Directory check triggers subprocess call; encoded command runs silently with no user interaction.",
  "anomalies": "Use of Base64-encoded PowerShell command, silent execution with hidden window, error suppression via try-except blocks.",
  "analysis": "The code checks for 'tahg' directory; if absent, executes a Base64-encoded PowerShell command silently, which is typical of obfuscated malicious payloads. The command is hidden and error handling suppresses failures, reducing detectability. The setup() call is standard and benign. The pattern aligns with known malicious techniques involving covert command execution during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed silently, representing a significant security threat. The behavior aligns with malicious activity, warranting high malware and risk scores.",
