{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up a Python package with metadata, but it also attempts to execute hidden PowerShell commands.",
  "sources": "The code reads the file system to check for the existence of 'tahg'; it also attempts to run a PowerShell encoded command via subprocess.Popen.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen executes a PowerShell command that may run obfuscated or malicious code, representing a potential sink for malicious activity.",
  "flows": "The code checks for the existence of 'tahg' -> if not present, executes a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a heavily encoded PowerShell command with hidden window style; the command is encoded in Base64, which is commonly used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The exception handling suppresses errors silently, avoiding detection. The setup call is typical but may be a cover for malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with importing 'distutils.core.setup' for package setup, which is benign. It then attempts to import 'subprocess' and 'os'. It checks if a directory 'tahg' exists; if not, it executes a PowerShell command in a hidden window, with the command encoded in Base64, which suggests obfuscation. The encoded command, when decoded, likely performs additional malicious actions or data exfiltration. The exception handling around both blocks suppresses errors silently, hiding potential issues. The setup call with minimal metadata appears standard but might be a decoy or wrapper for malicious activity. The use of encoded commands and silent exception handling are suspicious indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated PowerShell commands executed silently, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The setup routine appears normal but could serve as a cover. Overall, there is a high likelihood of malicious behavior due to the hidden, encoded payload execution, and the code should be considered unsafe.",
