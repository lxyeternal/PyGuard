{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package that also downloads and executes an external executable file from a remote URL.",
  "sources": "The URL in the function VNNOqPoTPUXKgpaibzZUoLrFVAmKWfzg() which fetches an executable file via HTTP request; the open() call writing the downloaded content to disk.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the downloaded executable using os.system(), which runs the file in the system shell.",
  "flows": "The function fetches the executable from the URL (source), writes it to disk, and then executes it via os.system (sink).",
  "anomalies": "The code downloads an executable file from a suspicious URL, saves it with a generic filename, and executes it without any validation or user consent. The code is designed to run only on Windows. The use of os.system() with a constructed command string that includes file deletion suggests obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a function that, on Windows systems, downloads an executable file from a GitHub URL, saves it locally, and then executes it. The filename and command include a delay and deletion of the executable, indicating an attempt to hide the activity. The setup() call contains a suspicious download URL, which is not typical for legitimate setup scripts. The overall structure suggests that this code is intended to perform malicious actions, such as installing unwanted software or executing malware, during the package installation process.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates malicious behavior by downloading and executing a remote executable without user consent. It likely aims to compromise the host system during package installation. The presence of hardcoded URLs, system calls, and the download-and-run pattern confirms malicious intent.",
