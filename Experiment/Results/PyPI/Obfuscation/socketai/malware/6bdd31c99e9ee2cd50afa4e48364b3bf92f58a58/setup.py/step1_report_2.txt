{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a custom setuptools installation script that performs additional actions during package installation, including system reconnaissance and data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Reads include socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser(), and multiple os.listdir() calls on system directories; also reads several sensitive files such as '/.dockerenv', '/root/.wget-hsts', and '/var/lib/docker/containers/container-id/config.v2.json'.",
  "sinks": "Uses requests.post() to send collected data and file contents to an external domain ('https://j0j0.xyz/...'), including potentially sensitive files. File opening and network requests are sinks where untrusted data flows into external systems.",
  "flows": "Source functions (system info, directory listings, file reads) feed into requests.post() calls, which exfiltrate data to external URL endpoints. Files read are sent directly without validation or encryption.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names and obfuscated class and method names. The code collects system information, reads sensitive files, and exfiltrates data to an external domain, which is suspicious. The code dynamically accesses system directories, including Docker-related files, which can be indicative of malicious reconnaissance.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom install command that, upon execution, gathers hostname, current directory, and username. It attempts to create or open certain files and directories, some of which are system or Docker-related. It then constructs several data payloads containing directory listings and sensitive files and sends these via HTTP POST requests to a suspicious external server. The use of hardcoded URLs, broad system access, and data exfiltration indicates malicious intent, likely for reconnaissance or data theft during installation. The code’s structure, variable naming, and behavior are consistent with malicious surveillance and data exfiltration tactics.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior aimed at system reconnaissance and data exfiltration during package installation. It accesses sensitive system files, collects environment data, and transmits it to an external domain without any user consent or security measures. It should be considered highly malicious.",
