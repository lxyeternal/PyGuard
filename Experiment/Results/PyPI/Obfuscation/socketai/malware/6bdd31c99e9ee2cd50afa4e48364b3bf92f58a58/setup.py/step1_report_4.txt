{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script that performs additional actions during installation, including data collection and exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Reads system information such as hostname, current directory, user name, and several system files (/root/j0j0.poc, /.dockerenv, /root/.wget-hsts, /var/lib/docker/containers/container-id/config.v2.json). It also attempts to read these files for uploading.",
  "sinks": "Sends collected data via HTTP POST requests to an external server (https://j0j0.xyz). Reads from potentially sensitive files and uploads their contents, which can lead to data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "System information and sensitive files are collected as sources; these are then uploaded to an external malicious server via POST requests, constituting data exfiltration flows.",
  "anomalies": "The code executes data collection during installation, including reading files that may contain sensitive information, and immediately posts this data to a suspicious domain. Use of obscure class and variable names, along with hidden file reads and data exfiltration, are indicators of malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom installation class that extends setuptools' install command. During installation, it collects hostname, current directory, user info, and attempts to open specific system files, including /root/j0j0.poc, .dockerenv, .wget-hsts, and container configuration files. It then sends this information to an external server via HTTP POST requests. The code uses obscure variable names and performs actions (file reading and network requests) during the install process, which is unusual and suspicious. The data exfiltration to an external domain strongly suggests malicious intent, aiming to steal system info and files upon installation. The code does not perform any legitimate setup tasks besides the malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, designed to exfiltrate sensitive system data during package installation to a suspicious external server. The obfuscated variable names, file reads of sensitive files, and network communication to a known malicious domain confirm malicious intent. It is highly dangerous and should be blocked or removed.",
