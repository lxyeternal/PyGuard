    "Data from hostname, user, current directory, and several system files (docker, root, etc, home, mount) are collected and sent to a remote server via POST requests.",
    "The code reads system files (e.g., /.dockerenv, /root/.wget-hsts, docker container config) and transmits their contents.",
    "The collected system information and files are sent over HTTPS to a suspicious domain (j0j0.xyz)."

    "The code is embedded in a setup script, which is unusual for malicious activity.",
    "Use of obfuscated variable names.",
    "Attempted access to files that may contain sensitive or system-specific data."
  ],
  "analysis": "The script is a setup file that, in addition to performing installation, collects system information and files from common locations associated with Docker, root access, and user directories. It then transmits this data to an external server (j0j0.xyz) using POST requests. The presence of multiple system file reads, especially those related to Docker and root environment, and the direct exfiltration of their contents indicate malicious intent for data theft or espionage. The obfuscated class and method names further suggest an attempt to conceal malicious behavior. Overall, the script appears designed to stealthily gather system info and send it to an attacker-controlled domain, which is malicious and dangerous.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior, including data exfiltration of sensitive system files and environment information. It is highly suspicious due to its obfuscated nature, unusual activity within a setup script, and direct transmission of sensitive data to an external server. The risk level is very high, and the package should be considered malicious and unsafe to use.",
