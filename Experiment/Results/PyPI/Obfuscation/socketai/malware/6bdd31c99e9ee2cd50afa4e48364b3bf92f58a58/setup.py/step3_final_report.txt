  "analysis": "The code is designed to gather system information and sensitive files, then exfiltrate this data to a suspicious external domain. It uses obfuscated identifiers to hide its intent. The code reads critical system files such as '/.dockerenv', '/root/.wget-hsts', and Docker container configs, which are typical targets for reconnaissance. It also creates a marker file '/root/j0j0.poc'. All data is sent via HTTP POST requests, indicating active data theft. The obfuscation and data exfiltration during setup strongly suggest malicious activity. The code does not perform any legitimate setup functions besides these malicious actions. The external server domain and the targeted files confirm malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior, including reconnaissance and data exfiltration, during package installation. Its obfuscation and targeted file reads further confirm its malicious nature. The high scores assigned in the reports (malware: 1.0, security risk: 1.0, obfuscated: 0.8) are justified and consistent with the observed activities.",
