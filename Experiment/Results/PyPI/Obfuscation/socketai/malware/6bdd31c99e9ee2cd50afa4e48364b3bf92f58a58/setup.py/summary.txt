  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior, including reconnaissance and data exfiltration, during package installation. Its obfuscation and targeted file reads further confirm its malicious nature. The high scores assigned in the reports (malware: 1.0, security risk: 1.0, obfuscated: 0.8) are justified and consistent with the observed activities."
