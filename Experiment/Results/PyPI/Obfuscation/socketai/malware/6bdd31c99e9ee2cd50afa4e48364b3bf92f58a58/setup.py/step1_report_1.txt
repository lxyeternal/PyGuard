  ],
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that overrides the 'install' command. When invoked, it gathers hostname, current working directory, and username. It then attempts to create a file '/root/j0j0.poc', possibly as a marker. It collects directory listings from several system paths, including root, /etc, /home, /mnt, /run, and /rasp/. These data are stored in dictionaries. The script then posts each dataset to a remote server ('https://j0j0.xyz/lists/...') associated with the hostname and username. Additionally, it reads sensitive system files, such as Docker environment files and configuration JSON, and exfiltrates their content via POST requests. The code's structure, especially the obfuscated class and variable names, and the use of multiple system files and directories, indicate malicious intent related to system reconnaissance and data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious and malicious in nature. It collects system information, sensitive files, and environment details, then transmits them to a malicious server. The obfuscation, targeted files, and data exfiltration behavior point to a covert data theft or reconnaissance tool embedded within a package setup process. It should be considered malware, and usage of this package is strongly discouraged.",
