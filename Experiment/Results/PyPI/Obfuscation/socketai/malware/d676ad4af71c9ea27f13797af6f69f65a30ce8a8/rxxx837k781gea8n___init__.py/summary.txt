  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no evidence of malware or obfuscation. The moderate risk score in Report 2 is justified due to potential misuse of dynamic evaluation and environment variables, but no malicious activity is confirmed. Overall, the assessments are consistent and appropriate; no adjustments are necessary."
