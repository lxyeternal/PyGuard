  "purpose": "A menu-driven Python script wrapping OpenSSL commands for cryptographic operations, allowing file encryption/decryption, key generation, signing, and verification.",
  "sources": "User inputs for menu choices, filenames, key sizes, cipher options, and other parameters.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'os.system()' commands constructed via string concatenation with user inputs, leading to potential command injection.",
  "flows": "User inputs are directly incorporated into shell command strings without validation, flowing from input prompts to system calls.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'os.system()' with unsanitized user inputs; variable names are nonsensical but not malicious; no input validation or sanitization performed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a cryptographic utility that relies on external OpenSSL commands. It constructs shell commands by concatenating user inputs directly, which poses a significant command injection risk. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or malware are present. The main concern is unsafe handling of inputs, which could be exploited to execute arbitrary commands. The code does not exhibit obfuscation beyond superficial variable naming. The security risk score is high (~0.75), consistent with the potential for command injection. Malware score remains 0, as no malicious code or payloads are detected. Input validation and safer command execution methods are recommended.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a cryptographic utility with insecure practices that could lead to command injection vulnerabilities. There is no evidence of malware or malicious intent. The primary risk stems from unsafe input handling, which should be addressed through validation and the use of safer subprocess methods.",
