  "anomalies": "Code gathers extensive system info and transmits it over the network without user consent, which is suspicious. Usage of dynamic runtime info and network activity in a setup script is unusual. The code also includes obfuscated variable names and string concatenations that seem designed to hide malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script imports system and network modules and gathers sensitive system information such as username, hostname, platform details, locale, and IP address. It constructs a composite string with this info, encodes it in base64, and sends it via HTTP POST to a remote URL, which is typical behavior for data exfiltration. The setup() call at the end is standard, but the pre-setup code performing data collection and transmission is suspicious. Variable names are obfuscated, and the code uses conditional logic for different Python versions, further suggesting an attempt to hide its true intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior involving system data collection and exfiltration without user consent. It does not appear to be just a benign setup script, but rather performs potentially malicious network activity, indicating a security risk. The overall malicious behavior score is high due to data exfiltration activities.",
