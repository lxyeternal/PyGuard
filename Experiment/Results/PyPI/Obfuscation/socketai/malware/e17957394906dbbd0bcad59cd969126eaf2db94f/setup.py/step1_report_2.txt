{
  "purpose": "This code appears to set up a Python package, but also includes a hidden process to execute potentially malicious PowerShell code.",
  "sources": "The code reads the filesystem (os.path.exists) and the embedded PowerShell encoded command string, which is executed via subprocess.Popen.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.Popen executes the encoded PowerShell command, which may perform arbitrary actions on the system.",
  "flows": "Filesystem check (source) -> if condition triggers PowerShell execution (sink) via subprocess.Popen.",
  "anomalies": "The PowerShell command is encoded and executed without validation, and the subprocess is run with 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' to hide its activity. The try-except blocks suppress errors, hiding failures.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a filesystem check for 'tahg'. If the directory does not exist, it executes an obfuscated PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with hidden window flags. The encoded command likely downloads or executes further malicious payloads silently. The setup function defines package metadata but is overshadowed by the malicious subprocess call. The suppression of exceptions prevents detection of failures. Overall, this code exhibits malicious intent through stealthy remote command execution and concealment techniques.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains malicious behavior by executing hidden PowerShell code that could perform harmful actions or download malicious payloads. The setup part is benign but overshadowed by the malicious subprocess invocation. This code poses a high security risk.",
