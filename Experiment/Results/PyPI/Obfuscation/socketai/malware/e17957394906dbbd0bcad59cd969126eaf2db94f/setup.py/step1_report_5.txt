  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package and attempts to execute a PowerShell command if a specific directory does not exist.",
  "sources": "os.path.exists('tahg') check, subprocess.Popen call with encoded PowerShell command",
  "sinks": "subprocess.Popen with encoded command potentially executing malicious PowerShell code",
  "flows": "Check for 'tahg' directory -> If not exists, execute encoded PowerShell command via subprocess",
  "anomalies": "Use of encoded PowerShell command that is hidden and executed without user awareness; silent try-except blocks suppress errors; use of subprocess.Popen with creation flags that hide execution window",
  "analysis": "The script first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg'. If it does not exist, it attempts to run a PowerShell command encoded in base64. The command is executed via subprocess.Popen with options to hide the window, and errors are silently ignored. The setup call appears standard, with no suspicious classifiers. The key concern is the encoded PowerShell command, which likely contains malicious instructions given its obfuscated nature and execution conditions. The code structure and error suppression suggest an attempt to conceal malicious activity. No other malicious code or hardcoded credentials are present. The rest of the setup code appears normal and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The script attempts to execute an encoded PowerShell command when the 'tahg' directory is absent, with execution hidden and errors suppressed. The encoded command is suspicious, likely malicious, and intended to run covertly. The setup configuration itself is benign, but the hidden command execution indicates malicious intent.",
