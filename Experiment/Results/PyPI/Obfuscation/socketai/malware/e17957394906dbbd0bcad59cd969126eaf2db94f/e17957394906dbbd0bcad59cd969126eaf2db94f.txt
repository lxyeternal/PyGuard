      "conclusion": "The code contains confirmed malicious behavior through the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during setup. The high obfuscation and stealth tactics justify elevated malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores. The overall assessment indicates a high probability of malicious intent, warranting caution and further decoding of the payload for definitive analysis."
