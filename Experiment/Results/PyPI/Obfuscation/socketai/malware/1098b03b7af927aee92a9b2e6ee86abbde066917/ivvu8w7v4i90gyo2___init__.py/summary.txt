  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with no overt malicious indicators. However, the presence of obfuscation and dynamic execution functions in one report suggests moderate suspicion, warranting further analysis. Adjusting the malware score slightly upward in the suspicious case improves risk assessment accuracy. Overall, the dependency does not exhibit confirmed malicious behavior but should be monitored for obfuscation and dynamic code patterns."
