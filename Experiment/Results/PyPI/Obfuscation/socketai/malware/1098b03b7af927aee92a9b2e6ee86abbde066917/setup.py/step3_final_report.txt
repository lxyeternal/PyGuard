{
  "purpose": "The code collects environment variables and exfiltrates them to an external URL during package setup, likely for malicious data theft.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables via os.environ, during execution of custom develop and install commands.",
  "sinks": "Sending HTTP POST request with environment data to external server (https://2edb-85-48-187-158.ngrok-free.app).",
  "flows": "Environment variables are collected, URL-encoded, and transmitted over network during setup commands execution.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function and class names; exfiltration occurs during package install/develop; use of ngrok URL; data sent without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that captures all environment variables, prints them, encodes, and sends them via an HTTP request to an external URL. This function is invoked during custom 'develop' and 'install' commands, which run during package setup. The obfuscated naming and external URL suggest malicious intent. The exfiltration of environment data, potentially containing sensitive information, during installation is a serious security concern. The code does not perform any benign actions and actively leaks data to an external server, indicating high malicious potential. The obfuscation further supports malicious intent. Scores of malware (0.9), obfuscated (0.8), and security risk (0.9) are justified based on this behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and likely malicious, performing environment data exfiltration during package setup with obfuscated code and external network communication. It should be flagged and investigated further before use.",
