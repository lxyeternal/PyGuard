{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package installation process and includes additional behavior during installation or development setup.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables via os.environ within the function trfNHZgqPyYiaMkWOhKfTAWTNjzycsCL().",
  "sinks": "It sends the environment data encoded in URL form to an external URL ('https://2edb-85-48-187-158.ngrok-free.app') via urllib's request, which could be used to exfiltrate data.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are collected in trfNHZgqPyYiaMkWOhKfTAWTNjzycsCL(), then encoded and sent via a POST request to the specified URL during the execution of the develop or install commands.",
  "anomalies": "The function name and variable names are obfuscated or nonsensical. The code contacts an external server with environment data during setup, which is unusual for a typical package installation. The URL is an ngrok endpoint, often used for tunneling or malicious purposes. The function trfNHZgqPyYiaMkWOhKfTAWTNjzycsCL() is called during package setup commands, indicating an unexpected external communication during install/develop phases.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup tools but then defines a function that captures environment variables and sends them to an external URL via an HTTP request, which is a potential data exfiltration or malicious activity. The function is invoked within custom subclasses of 'develop' and 'install', meaning it executes during package installation or development setup. The variable and function names are intentionally obfuscated, raising suspicion. There are no visible attempts at malicious system modification, but the external data transmission during package setup is suspicious and possibly malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains obfuscated code that exfiltrates environment variables to an external server during installation or development setup. This behavior indicates malicious intent, such as data theft or remote command/control setup, especially given the use of an ngrok tunnel URL. The code should be considered malicious or at least highly suspicious.",
