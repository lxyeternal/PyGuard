  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that includes custom install and develop commands.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (os.environ), URL request to an external server (urllib.request), data encoding (urllib.parse.urlencode).",
  "sinks": "Potential network request sending environment variables to an external URL, possibly exfiltrating data.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> URL encoding -> HTTP request to external server.",
  "anomalies": "The function 'trfNHZgqPyYiaMkWOhKfTAWTNjzycsCL' collects environment variables, encodes them, and sends them to an external ngrok URL without any user prompt or validation. The code references obfuscated variable and class names. The setup parameters contain nonsensical or malformed key-value pairs (e.g., 'prxjWEcQENzmHHumuEJsdfTZSCalLxNC='). The code is intentionally obfuscated or designed to hide malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools but adds custom commands 'develop' and 'install' that extend their behavior. The functions collect all environment variables, print them, encode them, and send them via a POST request to an external ngrok URL, which could be used for data exfiltration. The URL is hardcoded, and the data sent includes all environment variables, which could contain sensitive information such as credentials or tokens. The class and variable names are obfuscated, indicating an attempt to conceal malicious behavior. The setup configuration has irregular key-value pair syntax and potentially malicious custom commands that trigger data transmission during package installation or development setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating environment variables to an external server during package setup or development. The obfuscation and external network activity strongly suggest malicious intent, such as data theft or remote control activation. It is highly risky and should not be used or trusted.",
