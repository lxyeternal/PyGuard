{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package with custom install and develop commands, but it also contains potentially malicious code that exfiltrates environment variables to an external server.",
  "sources": "Environment variables accessed via os.environ, used as input data for URL encoding and HTTP request.",
  "sinks": "HTTP request to external server 'https://2edb-85-48-187-158.ngrok-free.app' with environment data sent as payload.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are collected, URL-encoded, and then sent via an HTTP request to an external server during package installation or development setup.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated function and variable names, unusual code structure, and active data exfiltration during setup commands. The code uses an environment-based payload to send data to an external URL, which is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools modules for package setup, but also defines functions and classes with obfuscated names. The function 'trfNHZgqPyYiaMkWOhKfTAWTNjzycsCL' collects all environment variables, prints them, and then sends them to a suspicious URL using urllib. This function is invoked during custom 'develop' and 'install' commands, which are typically used during package setup. The obfuscated naming and the act of exfiltrating environment data indicate malicious intent, possibly to gather system info or secret data during installation. The overall structure suggests code is designed to run hidden operations during package setup, which is highly suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by exfiltrating environment variables to an external server during package installation or development. The obfuscated function names and the nature of the external request strongly suggest malicious intent. This package could be used as a supply chain attack vector to gather sensitive system information without user consent.",
