{
  "purpose": "This code appears to set up a Python package using setuptools and includes custom behaviors during installation and development modes.",
  "sources": "Environment variables accessed via os.environ, data from environment variables used to construct and send HTTP requests to an external URL.",
  "sinks": "The constructed HTTP request with environment data sent to an external URL (potential data exfiltration).",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> URL encoding -> HTTP request to external server.",
  "anomalies": "Code constructs environment variable dictionary, encodes it, and sends it over the network to an external URL during install/develop commands. The URL points to an ngrok address, which is suspicious as it could be used for data exfiltration or command-and-control.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup tools but then defines functions and classes that override installation and development commands. The function 'trfNHZgqPyYiaMkWOhKfTAWTNjzycsCL' collects all environment variables, prints them, encodes them, and sends them via an HTTP request to an external URL (https://2edb-85-48-187-158.ngrok-free.app). The custom classes 'AbSrOmKRODIUmNGoeXJmYLantqPtBsMY' and 'nGmHXnPnHfWmdrDmqVisHnElPJyhwCjt' invoke this function during their execution, i.e., during package install or development. The URL is suspicious due to its ngrok domain, indicating possible exfiltration of environment data. The code also contains obfuscated class names and functions, which could be used to hide malicious intent. No other malicious behaviors like code execution, backdoors, or data theft beyond environment data exfiltration are apparent. The use of environment variables and network request in install/develop commands is highly suspicious and indicative of potential malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code exfiltrates environment variables to an external server during package installation or development, indicating malicious behavior aimed at data theft or surveillance. The obfuscation and external URL usage are signs of malicious intent. The package should be considered dangerous for deployment.",
