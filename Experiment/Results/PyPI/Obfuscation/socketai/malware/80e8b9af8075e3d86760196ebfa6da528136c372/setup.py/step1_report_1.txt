  "purpose": "To set up a Python package with specified metadata and possibly execute a hidden PowerShell command.",
  "sources": "os.path.exists('tahg'), subprocess.Popen call with encoded PowerShell command",
  "sinks": "subprocess.Popen executing an encoded PowerShell command, potentially executing arbitrary code",
  "flows": "Check if 'tahg' exists -> execute encoded PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen",
  "anomalies": "Encoded PowerShell command executed via subprocess.Popen with hidden window, no error handling or validation, presence of try-except blocks that suppress errors",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup from distutils, then conditionally executes a subprocess that runs a PowerShell command encoded in base64. The command appears to be obfuscated and is run in a hidden window with no visible output. The use of os.path.exists to control execution suggests a covert or conditional behavior. The try-except blocks suppress errors silently, hiding potential failures. The setup call only specifies package metadata. The encoded PowerShell command, if decoded, could perform arbitrary actions, potentially malicious, including system modifications or data exfiltration. The code does not validate or sanitize inputs, and the command is encoded, which is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains a hidden execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command that is triggered if a specific file does not exist. The use of encoded commands, silent error suppression, and hidden window execution suggests malicious intent or at least suspicious behavior. The setup process appears normal, but the embedded PowerShell command is the primary concern.",
