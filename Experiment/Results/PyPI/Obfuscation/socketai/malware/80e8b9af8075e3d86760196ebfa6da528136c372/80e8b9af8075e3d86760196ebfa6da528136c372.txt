      "conclusion": "The code exhibits behaviors consistent with malicious activity, notably the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during setup. While definitive maliciousness cannot be confirmed without decoding the command, the pattern strongly suggests malicious intent. The high obfuscation, stealth, and error suppression contribute to a high security risk. Scores assigned by the reports are appropriate; they should be considered with caution, and further decoding is recommended to confirm payload intent."
