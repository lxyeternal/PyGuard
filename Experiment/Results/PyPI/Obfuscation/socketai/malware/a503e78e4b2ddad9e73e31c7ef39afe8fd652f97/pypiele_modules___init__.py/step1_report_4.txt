  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be related to performing network requests or data processing, possibly as part of a larger application.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from environment variables, user inputs, or possibly external files or network sources (if present).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, system commands, or data storage operations where untrusted data could cause harm or leaks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or user input through processing functions, potentially reaching sinks like network sockets or file writes.",
  "anomalies": "No clear hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code were identified. However, any use of eval or exec, dynamic imports, or unusual code patterns would be considered suspicious if present. In absence of such, the code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily involves standard Python operations such as reading environment variables or user input, processing data, and performing network or file operations. No malicious patterns like data exfiltration, reverse shells, or malicious system modifications are evident. The code structure is conventional, and no obfuscation techniques are observed. Without further context, it appears to serve a legitimate purpose, though detailed inspection of all functions is necessary if additional code exists.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code fragment, there are no apparent signs of malicious behavior or malware. The code does not exhibit suspicious patterns or dangerous functionalities. The security risk is low, and confidence in this assessment is high.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
