  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is to perform data processing and possibly communicate with external services, but the specific intent is unclear without further context.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables, files, and possibly network sockets or APIs, depending on implementation details.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communication functions, file writing operations, and environment variable usage, which could lead to data leaks or code execution.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (user input, environment variables, files) to processing functions, and potentially to network sinks or file outputs, but exact flow details are not provided in the snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code constructs are detected. The code uses standard library functions and common patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to perform typical data processing tasks with standard practices. No signs of obfuscation, suspicious network activity, or malicious behavior are evident. The structure and usage seem normal for a Python package, and there are no embedded secrets or unusual dynamic execution patterns. Without external context or hidden code, it does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no clear indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a standard data processing script with no suspicious elements identified. Confidence in this assessment is high.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
