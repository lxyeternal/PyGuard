  "sources": "There are no identifiable sources in the provided code, such as input reading functions, environment variable access, or external data fetches.",
  "sinks": "No suspicious sinks are present; there are no indications of data being sent over networks, written to sensitive files, or other potentially malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are observable due to lack of code content.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements are present; the provided code appears empty or non-existent.",
  "analysis": "The review reveals no code to analyze; the absence of code prevents identifying any malicious behavior, security issues, or anomalies. As no code exists, no data sources, sinks, or flows can be determined.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided input, there is no code to evaluate for malicious behavior or security risks. The input appears empty, so no malicious activity or vulnerabilities can be identified. Further code details are necessary for a thorough assessment.",
