{
  "purpose": "To evaluate supply chain security of the open source dependency by analyzing provided code snippets for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code content, network requests, data processing functions, and absence of code where noted.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network communications, or malicious code execution points (not present in the provided snippets).",
  "flows": "Input sources (e.g., data, network) to processing functions, with no suspicious or malicious sinks identified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears standard, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify the presence or absence of code. When code is present, it performs typical data processing or network requests with no signs of malicious activity. Scores for malware and obfuscation are consistently zero, and risk scores are low (~0.2), reflecting benign assessments. When code is absent, confidence levels are appropriately low, and scores reflect uncertainty. No logical flaws or suspicious patterns are observed across the evaluations.",
  "conclusion": "The assessments are consistent, justified, and align with the described code snippets. No evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation is present. The low security risk scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code or its absence.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
