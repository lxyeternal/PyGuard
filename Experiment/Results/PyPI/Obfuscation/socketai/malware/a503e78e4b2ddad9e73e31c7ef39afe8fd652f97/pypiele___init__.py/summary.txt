  "conclusion": "The code is largely benign; the suspicion arises mainly from obfuscation and dynamic execution features, which are common in malicious code but not definitive here. The overall security risk is low, with malware likelihood also low. Slightly increasing malware scores in reports with obfuscation could better reflect suspicion, but current scores are acceptable. Continuous monitoring is recommended for suspicious segments."
