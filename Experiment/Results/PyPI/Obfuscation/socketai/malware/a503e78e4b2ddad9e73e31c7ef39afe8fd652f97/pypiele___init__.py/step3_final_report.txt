  "purpose": "Analyze the provided Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Input data read from code variables, environment variables, or external files; dynamic code execution points such as eval or exec.",
  "sinks": "Potential data exfiltration points, network connections, file modifications, or sensitive data handling that could lead to leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources through processing functions to sinks, especially if untrusted input influences network or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation techniques, dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, unusual variable naming, or convoluted logic that obscures intent.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits minimal malicious indicators; no hardcoded credentials, no suspicious network activity, and standard data processing. Obfuscation is present in some reports but not confirmed malicious. Dynamic execution patterns are noted but lack evidence of malicious payloads. Overall, the code appears benign with some suspicion in obfuscated segments. The scores in the reports are mostly consistent with these observations, with minor adjustments suggested for better alignment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is largely benign; the suspicion arises mainly from obfuscation and dynamic execution features, which are common in malicious code but not definitive here. The overall security risk is low, with malware likelihood also low. Slightly increasing malware scores in reports with obfuscation could better reflect suspicion, but current scores are acceptable. Continuous monitoring is recommended for suspicious segments.",
