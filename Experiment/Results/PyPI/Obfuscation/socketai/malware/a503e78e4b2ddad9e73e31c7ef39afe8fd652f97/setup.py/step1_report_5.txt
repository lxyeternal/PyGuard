{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package, including a custom install command that executes obfuscated code during installation.",
  "sources": "The obfuscated code embedded within the try block inside the InstallCommand.run() method, which is triggered during package installation.",
  "sinks": "The eval(compile()) call on dynamically deobfuscated code, which could execute arbitrary and potentially malicious code.",
  "flows": "The script reads obfuscated data from variables, decrypts it using a XOR operation with a key derived from a large numeric string, compiles, and executes the code, potentially executing malicious instructions during installation.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of highly obfuscated code intended to hide malicious activity, including a large encrypted payload and dynamic execution via eval and compile. The code's purpose appears to be executing concealed code during installation without transparent disclosure.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup utilities and defines a custom install command class. Within the run() method, it contains obfuscated code represented as a long string. This code is decrypted using a XOR cipher with a lengthy numeric string, then compiled and executed dynamically. The obfuscation indicates an intent to conceal malicious payloads, such as system commands, data exfiltration, or other harmful actions. The obfuscated code is only executed during the install process, which is a common tactic for supply chain attacks in Python packages. The overall structure and the presence of dynamic code execution strongly suggest malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains malicious obfuscated code that decrypts and executes potentially harmful scripts during installation. This behavior constitutes a security risk and indicates intentional sabotage or malware embedded within the package. The code should not be used in production environments.",
