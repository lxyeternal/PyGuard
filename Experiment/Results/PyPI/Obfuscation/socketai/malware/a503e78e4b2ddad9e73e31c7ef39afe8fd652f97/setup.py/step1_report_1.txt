{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package, with an embedded malicious payload that executes during installation.",
  "sources": "The malicious code is embedded in the variable wopvEaTEcopFEavc, which contains obfuscated data that appears to be encoded or encrypted. This data is processed in the run() method of the custom InstallCommand class.",
  "sinks": "The obfuscated data is decoded and then executed with eval(compile(...)), which can run arbitrary malicious code, potentially leading to system compromise, data theft, or remote code execution.",
  "flows": "The code reads the obfuscated payload from wopvEaTEcopFEavc, decodes it using a repeated XOR operation with a large numeric string, then compiles and evaluates the decoded string, executing hidden malicious behavior during installation.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of heavily obfuscated code, including unreadable variable names, large encoded data blob, and the use of eval(compile()), which are common indicators of malicious intent. The payload is executed unconditionally during installation, which is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools and defines a custom install command. Within this custom command's run() method, it contains an obfuscated payload stored in a variable. The payload appears to be a large encrypted or encoded string that is decoded via XOR with a large numeric string. After decoding, it is executed dynamically using eval(compile()), which is highly suspicious. This pattern is typical of malware embedding malicious scripts that execute during package installation, potentially installing backdoors, exfiltrating data, or performing other harmful actions. The rest of the script is a standard package setup configuration, but the embedded payload is the main concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a hidden malicious payload that is obfuscated and executed during package installation, representing a high security threat. The intent appears to be to run arbitrary code on the host system without user awareness, indicating malicious behavior.",
