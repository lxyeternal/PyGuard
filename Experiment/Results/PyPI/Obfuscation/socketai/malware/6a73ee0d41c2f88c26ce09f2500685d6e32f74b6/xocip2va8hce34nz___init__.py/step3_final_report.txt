  "purpose": "To evaluate supply chain security risks of the open source Python dependency based on provided code analysis reports.",
  "sources": "Code snippets, input handling, environment variables, network operations, dynamic code execution (exec()), and obfuscation indicators.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, untrusted input execution, network connections, file modifications, and environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Input sources (user input, environment variables) to sinks (exec(), network calls, file writes), with potential for malicious data to influence execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() with untrusted input, obfuscation patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious variable naming.",
  "analysis": "Most reports describe benign code with no malicious indicators, consistent scoring, and appropriate confidence levels. Report 5 highlights dynamic exec() usage, which is inherently risky. The malware score of 0.2 reflects potential but unconfirmed malicious activity; obfuscation score of 0.3 is justified by code obscurity. The security risk score of 0.6 aligns with the unsafe pattern. Slight adjustments suggest that the malware score could be marginally increased to 0.3 if untrusted input is involved, but current evidence supports the existing score. Overall, the assessments are consistent with the described code behaviors, with the main concern being the unsafe dynamic execution pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The majority of the code appears benign with appropriate scoring. The use of exec() without validation introduces moderate risk, warranting a cautious approach. The scores are consistent with the evidence, but ongoing monitoring is recommended, especially for report 5. Overall, the dependency shows low to moderate security risk, primarily due to unsafe dynamic code execution patterns.",
