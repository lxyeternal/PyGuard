  "conclusion": "The majority of the code appears benign with appropriate scoring. The use of exec() without validation introduces moderate risk, warranting a cautious approach. The scores are consistent with the evidence, but ongoing monitoring is recommended, especially for report 5. Overall, the dependency shows low to moderate security risk, primarily due to unsafe dynamic code execution patterns."
