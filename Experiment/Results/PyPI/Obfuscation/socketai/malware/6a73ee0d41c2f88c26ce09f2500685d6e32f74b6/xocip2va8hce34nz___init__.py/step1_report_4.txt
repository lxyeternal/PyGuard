{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a utility module for handling data and performing certain operations, possibly related to network or file processing.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly shown in the provided snippet; if present, they could include environment variables, user inputs, or external files.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are not clearly demonstrated; could include network connections, file writes, or data outputs depending on full context.",
  "flows": "No explicit source-to-sink data flows are observable in the given code snippet; without external calls or data handling shown, flow analysis is limited.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected in the visible code. The code structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The provided code snippet is minimal and primarily consists of standard Python functions and class definitions without external dependencies or suspicious patterns. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The lack of input/output handling, network activity, or secret storage reduces concern. Without additional context or external code, this appears to be benign utility code.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems to be a standard component with no suspicious features.",
