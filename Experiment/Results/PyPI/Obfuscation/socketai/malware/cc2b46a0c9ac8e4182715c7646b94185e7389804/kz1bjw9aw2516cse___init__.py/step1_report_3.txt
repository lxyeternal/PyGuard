{
  "purpose": "Obfuscated and complex code structure likely intended for malicious activity or sabotage, involving dynamic imports, code execution, and hidden behaviors.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from multiple locations, including the '__code__' variable, function parameters, and potentially via dynamic import and eval functions. Data is also read from encrypted or encoded strings embedded within the code.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'exec', 'eval', dynamic import, and attribute access to execute or evaluate code, which can be used to run malicious payloads or download/execute malicious scripts. Also, there are network URLs embedded but not directly used as sinks.",
  "flows": "Sources such as '__code__' and dynamic import/eval functions flow into execution points like 'exec' and 'eval'. Dynamic attribute access and function calls facilitate code execution from obfuscated strings, enabling remote code execution or data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated string literals, dynamic import via obfuscated strings, complex lambda functions executing code, unusual use of 'exec', 'eval', and cryptic variable names. Also, cryptic string encoding, and meaningless operations with large numbers and bitwise operations, which are typical obfuscation techniques. The code includes deliberately confusing constructs, like nested lambdas and disguised code imports.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing all builtins, renaming 'prod' to 'Substract', and defining some URLs and license info. It defines a class with methods that perform arbitrary calculations, including divisions by negative or large numbers, and exception handling that triggers code execution through obfuscated strings. Inside the class, functions involve executing code with 'exec' and 'eval' on obfuscated strings, many of which are base64-encoded or hexadecimal representations of code snippets. The main block runs obfuscated code via 'exec', dynamically imports modules, and executes complex lambda functions that decrypt or decode embedded strings. The code also attempts to dynamically import modules, execute payloads, and perform conditional logic that appears designed to hinder analysis. The use of large, confusing number calculations, cryptic string literals, and multiple try-except blocks, suggests malicious intent, possibly to load and execute remote or embedded malicious scripts. The overall structure is intentionally complex and obfuscated, likely to conceal malicious activity or sabotage behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated with dynamic code execution, complex string manipulations, and imports, indicating malicious intent or sabotage. It is likely designed to execute hidden payloads, possibly from remote sources, or to perform malicious actions while evading analysis. The code's structure and techniques strongly suggest malicious behavior.",
