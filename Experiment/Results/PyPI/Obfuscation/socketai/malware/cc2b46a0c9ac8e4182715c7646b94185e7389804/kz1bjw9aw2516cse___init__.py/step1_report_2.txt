{
  "purpose": "Obfuscated script executing dynamic imports, evaluations, and possibly malicious code execution, likely designed to conceal its true purpose.",
  "sources": "Input data from string literals, especially the large encoded string, and dynamically imported modules. Data is read during dynamic import and eval calls.",
  "sinks": "Calls to eval, exec, dynamic import, and attribute access on potentially malicious objects. Uses eval and exec with obfuscated strings, which could execute malicious code or backdoors.",
  "flows": "Sources include string literals and dynamic imports; sinks are eval, exec, and attribute access leading to code execution. Data flows from encoded strings and dynamic imports into eval and exec calls.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with string encoding, dynamic import, eval, exec, and complex lambda functions hiding true intentions. Use of hardcoded URLs, encoded strings, and arbitrary code execution points indicate malicious obfuscation and potential backdoor or malware activity.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with heavily obfuscated imports and functions, including dynamic module loading and execution of encoded strings. It constructs code at runtime using eval, exec, and import, suggesting an attempt to hide malicious payloads or backdoors. The presence of large encoded strings and numerous lambda functions indicates obfuscation. Conditional statements trigger eval or code execution based on arbitrary conditions. Exception handling executes further obfuscated code, often with eval or eval-like functions. The code appears designed to execute hidden code, potentially downloading or executing malicious payloads, or establishing backdoors, making it highly suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script employs extensive obfuscation, dynamic imports, and eval/exec calls, all indicative of malicious intent. It is designed to hide its true behavior and potentially execute malicious code, backdoors, or payloads, making it dangerous and unreliable for use.",
