{
  "purpose": "Obfuscated and complex code executing multiple function calls, possibly to hide malicious intent or perform covert operations.",
  "sources": "Input data from external URLs, hardcoded strings, and function parameters; reading environment variables and global variables.",
  "sinks": "Function calls that perform calculations, dynamic imports, file operations, or network communications, potentially to exfiltrate data or execute arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from obfuscated functions and external URL data through various calculations and function calls, potentially leading to code execution or data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated code, multiple try-except blocks, usage of eval and exec with obfuscated strings, complex lambda functions importing modules dynamically, and seemingly meaningless calculations or comparisons (e.g., 'if 124413 > 9802197'). The code appears intentionally confusing, with attempts to hide real intentions.",
  "analysis": "The code uses obfuscation techniques such as string encoding, dynamic imports, and exec calls to hide malicious behavior. It performs calculations with large constants, and conditionals that never execute due to impossible conditions, possibly to mask code execution paths. It creates class instances with methods that modify internal states and invoke other functions, possibly to execute malicious payloads or exfiltrate data. The presence of eval, exec, dynamic module imports, and complex lambdas suggests an intent to run arbitrary code or manipulate system state covertly. External URLs and encoded strings further imply potential data exfiltration or command-and-control communication. The code also catches exceptions and reroutes flow, which could hide errors or malicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated with techniques commonly used in malicious scripts. It appears designed to execute hidden operations such as dynamic code execution, data exfiltration, or remote control. The complex, confusing structure and use of eval/exec strongly suggest malicious intent. Due to obfuscation, precise malicious actions are not immediately clear, but the risk of malicious behavior is high.",
