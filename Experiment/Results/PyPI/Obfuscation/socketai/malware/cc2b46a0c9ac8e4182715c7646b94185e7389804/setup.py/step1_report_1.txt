  "purpose": "Set up configuration for a Python package including dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading package dependencies from the 'install_requires' list.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no execution of untrusted data or sensitive data leaks evident.",
  "flows": "N/A — setup configuration, no data flow or execution paths beyond package specification.",
  "anomalies": "The variable name 'oyMaOBqNnAiqDdIXKlbFZxNfrXNiqiuH' appears to be a random string, but it is unused and does not impact execution.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools, defines a version string with a seemingly random variable name, and calls setup() with package name and dependencies. The dependencies include 'browser_cookie3', 'discordwebhook', 'robloxpy', 'requests', and 'json'. None of these dependencies inherently imply malicious behavior. No obfuscated code or suspicious logic is present. The random variable does not influence any code execution or configuration. Overall, the code is a standard setup script for a Python package with typical dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign setup script for packaging a Python project. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet.",
