  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for the 'certifi' Python package, extracting version info from __init__.py and handling package distribution commands.",
  "sources": "Reads the __init__.py file to extract version; checks command-line arguments for 'publish'; defines package metadata.",
  "sinks": "Uses os.system to execute 'python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel upload' when 'publish' argument is provided.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument 'publish' triggers the os.system call for package upload.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variable names; a variable with a nonsensical string 'nsPWDhFCUMdYGxOnSJEQbmWvVyPKgpKa=' that is unused; minimal obfuscation and random strings.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscation primarily in variable names and an unused string variable. The regex extracts version info from __init__.py. The os.system call for publishing is typical but should be used cautiously. The suspicious string variable is not used elsewhere, indicating it is likely residual or obfuscation. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. The obfuscation does not appear malicious but may be superficial or for code aesthetics.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, obfuscated setup configuration with no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The obfuscation is superficial, and the only notable concern is the use of os.system, which is controlled and standard in such scripts.",
