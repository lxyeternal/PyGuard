{
  "purpose": "Detects and executes an obfuscated PowerShell command during package setup if a specific file/directory ('tahg') does not exist, likely for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "Filesystem check for 'tahg'; import statements; subprocess.Popen call with encoded PowerShell command.",
  "sinks": "Execution of a hidden, encoded PowerShell command via subprocess during setup.",
  "flows": "Filesystem check → condition not met → subprocess.Popen executes encoded PowerShell command.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64-encoded, obfuscated PowerShell command; silent execution with hidden window flags; error suppression with try-except blocks.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a filesystem check for 'tahg'. If absent, it runs a base64-encoded PowerShell command silently, likely to execute malicious code. The command is obfuscated, and execution occurs during package setup, which is suspicious. Error handling suppresses failures, hiding potential issues. The pattern matches common malware tactics for covert remote code execution or backdoor installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious intent due to obfuscated, silent PowerShell execution during setup, triggered by a filesystem check. The behavior aligns with supply chain attack techniques, warranting classification as malicious.",
