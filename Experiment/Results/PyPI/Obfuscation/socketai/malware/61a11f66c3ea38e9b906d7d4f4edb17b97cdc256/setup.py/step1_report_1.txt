{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to set up a Python package with specific metadata and custom installation behavior, including executing potentially malicious code during installation.",
  "sources": [
    "The 'exec' function call which decrypts and executes code using Fernet, conditional on OS being Windows.",
    "Potential imports of 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, which are specified as setup requirements."
  ],
  "sinks": [
    "The 'exec' call which runs decrypted code, potentially executing malicious payloads.",
    "Requests module is imported but not directly used in the visible code, but may be used by the decrypted payload."
  ],
  "flows": [
    "On Windows, during installation, the code decrypts a Fernet-encrypted string and executes it, which is a high-risk behavior.",
    "The decrypted code could perform malicious activities such as data exfiltration or system compromise."
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "Presence of obfuscated/deceptive variable names and encrypted code.",
    "Execution of decrypt and exec functions during setup, which is unusual and suspicious.",
    "The code is structured to run only on Windows, suggesting targeted malicious activity.",
    "The variable 'version' is assigned a nonsensical string, and setup parameters are obfuscated or malformed.",
    "The presence of a base64-like Fernet key and encrypted payload, which is a common obfuscation tactic for malicious code."
  ],
  "analysis": "The script is a setup configuration that, upon installation on a Windows system, decrypts and executes hidden code via Fernet encryption. The encrypted payload is not visible, indicating an attempt to hide malicious intent. The use of 'exec' with decrypted data poses a significant security risk, as it could run arbitrary malicious commands. The code structure and obfuscated variable names suggest malicious obfuscation techniques. The setup's metadata is also nonsensical, which further supports malicious intent. The inclusion of 'requests' and 'fernet' as setup requirements may be to facilitate external communication or cryptographic operations if the payload relies on them. Overall, this is a malicious supply chain attack vector aimed at executing arbitrary code during package installation, specifically on Windows systems.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains malicious behavior designed to decrypt and execute code during installation on Windows platforms. The use of obfuscation, encrypted payload, and execution of decrypted code signifies a high probability of malicious intent, posing significant security risks. The package should be considered dangerous and avoided.",
