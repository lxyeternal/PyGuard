{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to set up a Python package with custom installation behavior, possibly performing malicious activities during installation.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (os.name), importing 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, reading embedded encrypted data, executing decrypted code.",
  "sinks": "exec() function with decrypted code, importing potentially suspicious modules ('requests', 'fernet'), environment checks (os.name), and dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Check os.name -> If 'nt' then import 'requests' and 'fernet' -> decrypt payload with Fernet -> execute payload with exec() during install -> potential remote code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names, encrypted payload decrypted and executed during install, conditional execution based on OS, dynamic execution of decrypted code which could be malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup configuration with obfuscated variable names and a custom install class. During installation, if the OS is Windows ('nt'), it imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then decrypts a payload with Fernet and executes it via exec(). The decrypted payload is a binary string, which suggests dynamic code execution that could be malicious. The code includes obfuscation and conditional code execution, both common in malicious packages aiming to hide their true intent. The presence of encrypted code that executes during install strongly indicates malicious intent, especially given the context of the previous functions and modules used.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be malicious, executing decrypted code during installation on Windows systems. The obfuscation, encrypted payload, and use of exec() are suspicious. This package could perform unauthorized actions or remote code execution when installed, indicating a high security risk.",
