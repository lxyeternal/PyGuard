{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package with some obfuscated variable names and a conditional execution of code on Windows systems that decrypts and executes encrypted code.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (os.name), importing modules ('os', 'requests', 'fernet'), decrypting an encrypted string, and executing the decrypted code.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing decrypted code, potentially running malicious code on Windows systems.",
  "flows": "On Windows ('nt'), the code imports modules, decrypts a string with Fernet, and executes the decrypted code via exec().",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, encrypted payload execution via exec(), conditional code execution based on OS, and use of Fernet encryption with a hardcoded key.",
  "analysis": "The script starts with obfuscated variable names, making analysis difficult. It imports standard setup functions and defines a class that inherits from install. Inside the class, if the OS is Windows, it imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload with Fernet and executes it. The use of encrypted code and dynamic execution suggests an attempt to conceal malicious intent. The decrypted code could perform any action, such as system compromise, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities. The presence of hardcoded encryption keys and conditional execution raises suspicion of malicious behavior or backdoor functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits significant suspicious behavior, including obfuscation, encrypted payload execution, and conditional code execution on Windows. These factors suggest a high likelihood of malicious intent, potentially serving as a backdoor or malware delivery mechanism. It should be regarded as malicious until further analysis of the decrypted payload confirms safety.",
