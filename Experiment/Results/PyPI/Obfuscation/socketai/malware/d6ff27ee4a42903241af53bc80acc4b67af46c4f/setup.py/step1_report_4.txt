{
  "purpose": "This setup script is intended to configure and install a Python package, but it contains malicious code designed to establish a reverse shell connection to a remote server.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables, executes shell commands via os.system, and constructs a base64-encoded command for execution.",
  "sinks": "The base64-encoded payload, once decoded, executes a reverse shell connection to a remote IP and port, providing remote control over the infected system.",
  "flows": "The code constructs a reverse shell command, encodes it in base64, decodes it, and executes it via os.system, enabling remote access.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variable names, base64 encoding of a potentially malicious command, and the execution of a shell command that initiates a reverse shell connection are highly suspicious. The code overwrites the install method with an obfuscated class name and executes network activity during package installation.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools and extends the install class with an obfuscated class name. In the overridden 'cqKeYxoFCWnUimMDVKXQbwXLutoSJCvH' method, it creates a reverse shell command that connects to a specified IP (81.68.90.93) and port (4444). This command is formatted into a string, base64-encoded, and then decoded and executed via os.system. The reverse shell uses Python to spawn a bash shell over the network, which could be used by an attacker to take control of the system. The obfuscation and the timing of network activity during setup strongly indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior, specifically a reverse shell that connects to a remote server, indicating it is designed for remote unauthorized access. The obfuscation and placement during package setup are suspicious and likely malicious.",
