{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup process that, during installation, executes a reverse shell connecting to IP 81.68.90.93 on port 4444, allowing remote control of the host system.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded IP and port variables, constructs a command string with network and shell operations, and encodes it in base64.",
  "sinks": "The execution of the decoded base64 command via os.system, which spawns a reverse shell back to the attacker’s server.",
  "flows": "The code constructs a base64-encoded string of a Python reverse shell payload, decodes it, and executes it with os.system during setup, establishing a network connection and spawning a shell.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class and method names, base64 encoding of malicious payload, execution during package installation, hardcoded IP and port, and the payload's purpose to spawn a reverse shell.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that overrides a method (likely install.run). Within this method, it constructs a reverse shell command targeting IP 81.68.90.93 on port 4444, formats it as a Python one-liner that connects back and spawns a bash shell, encodes this command in base64, then decodes and executes it via os.system. The obfuscated class and method names, along with the embedded payload, strongly suggest malicious intent. The payload's execution during setup can give an attacker remote control over the host system. The use of base64 encoding and obfuscated identifiers indicates an attempt to conceal malicious activity. The activity is explicit, with no ambiguity about its harmful nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a clear malicious backdoor that establishes a reverse shell during package installation. The obfuscation, hardcoded IP/port, and execution method confirm malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports—malware: 1, securityRisk: 1, obfuscated: 0.8—are justified and consistent with the code's behavior. This package should be flagged as malicious, and distribution halted to prevent potential security breaches.",
