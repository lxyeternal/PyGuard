{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up a Python package, but it also contains malicious behavior intended to establish a reverse shell connection to a remote server.",
  "sources": "The code reads the network address and port, and constructs a base64-encoded shell command that, when executed, connects back to a remote server and spawns a shell.",
  "sinks": "The os.system() call executes a decoded base64 payload which establishes a reverse shell to an external IP and port, enabling remote control of the compromised machine.",
  "flows": "The code constructs a shell command with hardcoded IP and port, encodes it in base64, then decodes and executes it via os.system(), resulting in a network connection and reverse shell to the remote attacker.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated base64-encoded command, hardcoded external IP address and port, execution of potentially malicious shell command during setup, unusual class and method names, and the payload aims to spawn a reverse shell, which is suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom install class inheriting from setuptools. During installation, it constructs a reverse shell payload targeting IP 81.68.90.93 on port 4444. The payload is base64-encoded and then decoded and executed via os.system(), which results in establishing a remote shell connection. The code uses obfuscated variable names and constructs, indicating an attempt to conceal malicious intent. This is a clear indicator of malicious activity, as it allows remote control over the host during package installation, potentially without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains malicious behavior designed to establish a reverse shell connection during package installation. It uses obfuscation and hardcoded network details to hide its intent. The package should be considered malicious, and execution should be avoided.",
