{
  "purpose": "Setup script that defines a custom installation command which, when run, attempts to establish a reverse shell connection to a remote server.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded IP address ('81.68.90.93') and port (4444), and executes shell commands encoded in base64.",
  "sinks": "Execution of base64-decoded shell commands that spawn a reverse shell, connecting to the specified IP and port, with socket and process manipulation.",
  "flows": "The code constructs a malicious shell command with embedded IP and port, encodes it in base64, decodes it, and executes it via os.system, leading to reverse shell connection.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class names, dynamic shell command generation, base64 encoding of malicious commands, and executing shell commands during setup. The shell command is designed for remote access.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that overrides the 'install' method. During installation, it constructs a reverse shell command that connects back to a specific IP and port, encodes this command in base64, and then decodes and executes it via os.system. The reverse shell code uses socket, os, and pty modules to spawn a bash shell connected to the attacker's machine. This behavior indicates malicious intent aimed at remote access, which is a common backdoor technique. The presence of obfuscated class names and use of base64 encoding to conceal malicious commands further supports malicious activity. The setup configuration references an unusual package name and module, but that alone is not suspicious without context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious; it implements a backdoor that, during installation, connects to a remote server and spawns a reverse shell. The obfuscation, base64 encoding, and execution of shell commands confirm malicious intent.",
