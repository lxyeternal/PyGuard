  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to potentially establish a reverse shell connection to a remote server.",
  "sources": "The code constructs a socket connection string and encodes it in base64, then executes it via a shell command.",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing decoded base64 string that contains Python code for socket connection and shell spawning.",
  "flows": "Construction of socket command -> Base64 encoding -> Decoding and execution via os.system -> Establishment of reverse shell.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names; use of base64 encoding and decoding to hide malicious command; code that opens a network connection and spawns a shell; unusual variable naming; custom install class overriding default behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class inheriting from setuptools' install. During installation, it constructs a reverse shell payload targeting IP 81.68.90.93 on port 4444. This payload is base64 encoded, then decoded and executed via os.system, leading to a remote connection and shell spawning. The use of obfuscation, base64 encoding, and network connection in the install process strongly indicates malicious intent, likely for remote access or backdoor purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains a clear malicious backdoor that establishes a reverse shell connection during package installation. It is highly suspicious and poses a significant security risk.",
