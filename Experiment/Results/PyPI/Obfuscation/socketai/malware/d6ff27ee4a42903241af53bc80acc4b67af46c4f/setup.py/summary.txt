  "conclusion": "The code contains a clear malicious backdoor that establishes a reverse shell during package installation. The obfuscation, hardcoded IP/port, and execution method confirm malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports—malware: 1, securityRisk: 1, obfuscated: 0.8—are justified and consistent with the code's behavior. This package should be flagged as malicious, and distribution halted to prevent potential security breaches."
