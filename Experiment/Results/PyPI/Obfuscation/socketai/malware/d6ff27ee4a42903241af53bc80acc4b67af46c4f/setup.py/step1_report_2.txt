{
  "purpose": "Custom setup script that overrides the install command to execute a reverse shell connection to a remote server during installation.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded IP address and port, base64-encoded shell command, socket connection code.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decoded shell command via os.system, socket connection for reverse shell.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom install command constructs a reverse shell command, encodes it in base64, decodes it, and executes it via os.system.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class and method names, base64 encoding of shell command, reverse shell code embedded directly in setup script, execution during package installation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command class that inherits from setuptools' install. During the installation process, it constructs a reverse shell payload aimed at a specific IP and port, encodes this payload in base64, then decodes and executes it with os.system. The payload, when run, connects back to the specified IP/port, spawning a bash shell, which is characteristic of malicious remote access. The obfuscation via base64 and unusual naming further indicates intent to conceal malicious behavior. This behavior is highly suspicious and indicates an attempt to establish unauthorized remote access during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior, specifically a reverse shell payload executed at install time, suggesting compromise or malicious intent. It is highly likely to be used for unauthorized access or control of the system where the package is installed.",
