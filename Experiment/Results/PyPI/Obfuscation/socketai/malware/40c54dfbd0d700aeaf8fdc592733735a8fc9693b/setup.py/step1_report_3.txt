  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'az3hxlcygffs5h4p' with a specified version and dependency.",
  "sources": "Code reads package name, version, and dependencies from the setup configuration.",
  "sinks": "Installation process may install 'requests' library; no direct data leakage or malicious sink present.",
  "flows": "Reading package metadata -> Installing specified dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "Package name appears as a random string, which could suggest obfuscation or malicious intent. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to define a Python package. The package name is unusual but not inherently malicious. The dependency on 'requests==2.31.0' is explicitly specified and does not show signs of malicious behavior. There are no indications of backdoors, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code. The script is minimal and adheres to common patterns for Python package setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate setup configuration with an unusual package name, which might be for obfuscation or a non-standard package. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident based solely on this script.",
