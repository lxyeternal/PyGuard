{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for data collection and exfiltration, specifically targeting user credentials, cookies, passwords, tokens, and other sensitive information from browsers and applications. It also includes mechanisms for network communication, file handling, and running external processes, potentially for malicious surveillance or theft.",
  "sources": "Network requests to external URLs (e.g., IP fetch, geolocation, Discord API, Gofile upload), environment variables, local files (browser data, login info, cookies, local state files, logs, directories), user inputs, and files in specified directories.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external webhooks and URLs (Discord webhook, Gofile upload, Google, etc.), file writing (logs, stolen data), process termination commands (taskkill), executing external commands, and reading sensitive data from browser databases and local files.",
  "flows": "Data is collected from environment variables, files, and network responses (sources). Sensitive information such as tokens, passwords, cookies, and browser data is read (sources) and then transmitted over the network via HTTP POST requests or uploaded files (sinks). The data flows from local sources through various processing functions and then is sent externally, often encoded or decrypted, to exfiltration endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "Multiple obfuscated or intentionally complex function and variable names, use of threading for concurrent data collection, code attempting to install dependencies silently, use of cryptographic functions for decryption, and suspicious URL patterns for exfiltration. The code references specific browser directories and wallet directories, indicating targeted data theft. The presence of various 'stealer' and 'zip' functions suggests data exfiltration routines. Also, the code contains many placeholder-like comments and inconsistent code segments, indicating potential obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes by gathering system paths and user data, then starts multiple threads for collecting browser data (passwords, cookies, local states), wallet info, and other sensitive files. It includes functions for decrypting encrypted credentials, capturing cookies, and reading browser databases. It then exfiltrates this data via Discord webhooks, uploads files to external servers, and manages processes related to various applications (Steam, Metamask, Wallets). The code is structured to operate stealthily, utilizing threading to parallelize data collection and prevent detection. Several functions encode and encrypt data before transmission, and the code targets common browsers and applications known to store sensitive info. The presence of hardcoded URLs, dependency installation routines, and extensive file handling indicates malicious behavior designed for credential theft and data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious intent, acting as a stealer targeting browser credentials, tokens, wallet info, and other sensitive data. It exfiltrates data via webhooks and external servers, terminates processes, and manipulates files, all typical behaviors of malware designed for information theft and privacy invasion. The obfuscated naming and multi-threaded approach suggest an attempt to evade detection and analysis. Overall, the script is highly malicious and should be considered dangerous.",
