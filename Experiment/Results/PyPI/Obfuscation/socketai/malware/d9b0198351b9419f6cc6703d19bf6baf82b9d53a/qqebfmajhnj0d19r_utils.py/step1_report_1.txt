{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a malicious script designed to steal sensitive information such as cookies, passwords, login data, tokens, and other personal details from various browsers and applications, then exfiltrate this data to a remote server or webhook.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, local files (browser data, login info, cookies), network requests (IP, geolocation, Discord API), and user data directories for browsers and applications.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent via HTTP POST requests to webhooks or upload services, written to files, or used for process manipulation (e.g., taskkill). It also reads and extracts sensitive data from encrypted databases and local state files.",
  "flows": "Sensitive data is extracted from local browser and application data, decrypted, and then transmitted via HTTP requests or uploaded to external servers. Threaded functions handle concurrent data exfiltration, and data flows from local storage to network sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation is not overt but the code has misleading variable names, irregular function naming, inconsistent formatting, and commented sections suggesting malicious intent (e.g., cookie, password, wallet, file stealing routines). The code also attempts to automatically install dependencies, forcibly kills processes, zips files, and uploads them, indicating malicious behavior. The code structure is complex and cluttered with non-standard practices, indicating obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script performs multiple malicious activities: it installs dependencies silently, extracts sensitive data from browsers and applications (including cookies, passwords, and wallet info), decrypts encrypted data using Windows cryptography APIs, and exfiltrates this data through HTTP POST requests to Discord webhooks and upload services. It employs threading to perform concurrent data collection from different sources. Several functions target popular browsers (Chrome, Opera, Edge, Yandex, Brave) and applications (Steam, Riot, Exodus, Atomic Wallet), collecting stored credentials and secrets. It also looks for specific patterns indicating wallet keys, cookies, or login tokens. The code attempts to kill processes associated with known apps to prevent interference and compresses data into zip archives before uploading. Variable names and code comments are intentionally obfuscated or misleading. Overall, the code demonstrates a comprehensive information-stealing malware targeting browsers, wallets, and chat applications, with external exfiltration mechanisms and process termination routines.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly malicious, intended for data theft, credential harvesting, and system compromise. It gathers sensitive information from various sources, decrypts encrypted data, and exfiltrates it to external servers. The complexity, obfuscation, and behavior patterns strongly indicate malicious intent with high security risk.",
