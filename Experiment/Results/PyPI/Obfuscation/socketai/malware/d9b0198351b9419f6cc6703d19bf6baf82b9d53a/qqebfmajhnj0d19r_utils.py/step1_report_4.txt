{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for extracting sensitive information such as cookies, passwords, and other user data from various browsers and applications, then exfiltrating this data via webhooks or uploads. It also includes capabilities to gather system info and run processes, suggesting malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from browser profile directories, local database files (e.g., Chrome, Opera, Brave, Yandex, Edge, Discord, Steam, Riot, Exodus, wallets), and system files such as 'Local State' and log/ldb files. It also reads environment variables, environment data, and possibly user input or system info via network requests.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent via HTTP POST requests to webhooks, uploaded to 'gofile.io', and via Discord API endpoints. It also executes commands to kill processes, remove files, and extract/decrypt stored credentials, passwords, cookies, and other sensitive information.",
  "flows": "Sensitive data is collected from various local files and databases, decrypted or processed, then sent through network requests or uploaded to external servers. There are multiple source-to-sink flows, notably from browser/system data to webhook uploads and file uploads. The code also executes process termination commands before archiving/exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded webhook URL, obfuscated variable/function names, extensive use of threading for parallel execution, and multiple file/database copying and reading operations. Use of decryption routines with encrypted keys suggests an attempt to bypass security protections. The code contains numerous obfuscated and misleading variable names, and attempts to decrypt or access stored credentials in browsers and applications. Multiple redundant or suspicious function calls (e.g., process termination, file archiving) indicate malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with environment variable access and attempts to install dependencies if missing, suggesting preparation for active data collection. It defines functions for system info gathering, browser data extraction (cookies, passwords, logs), and sensitive data exfiltration via requests or uploads. It decrypts stored credentials using Windows cryptographic functions, indicating intent to access protected data. Threading is employed for parallel execution, possibly to evade detection or speed up data collection. Several functions explicitly craft data packets for exfiltration, including Discord message embeds and file uploads. The code manipulates system files, decrypts stored credentials, and uploads or sends this data externally. It also contains code for process management (kill processes) and zipping files, typical of malware or spyware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and exhibits malicious behavior, primarily aimed at extracting and exfiltrating user credentials, cookies, system info, and other sensitive data. Its obfuscation, use of encrypted/decrypted data, and network activity strongly indicate malicious intent, aligning with typical spyware or credential-stealing malware. The presence of hardcoded webhook URLs and complex multi-threaded operations further reinforce its malicious nature.",
