  "obfuscated": 0.75,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code is definitively malicious, functioning as a comprehensive info-stealer targeting credentials, tokens, cookies, and wallet data. It employs obfuscation, process manipulation, and network exfiltration routines characteristic of malware. The overall security risk is extremely high, and the malware score is set to 1.0. Obfuscation is significant but not fully opaque, warranting a score around 0.75. The code should be classified as highly malicious with maximum security concern."
