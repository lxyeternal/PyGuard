{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a malicious script designed for stealing sensitive information such as cookies, passwords, tokens, and other personal data from various browsers and applications, then exfiltrating this data via webhooks and uploads to external servers.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables (LOCALAPPDATA, APPDATA, TEMP), local files (browser data, logs, databases), system commands, and network requests to external URLs and APIs.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are requests to webhook URLs, file creation/writing (logs, exfiltrated data), process termination commands, and file uploads to external servers.",
  "flows": "Data flows from system sources (browsers, logs, databases) through extraction functions, then to encoding/decryption routines, and finally to external communication channels like webhooks, file uploads, or server interactions.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behaviors include dynamic module installation, obfuscated/deceptive function names, extensive use of threading, and attempts to extract encrypted data from browser databases. The code also performs process termination on certain applications, and uploads large amounts of potentially stolen data to external URLs. There are multiple obfuscated or misleading variable names, and the code structure suggests concealment of malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script starts by importing modules and setting up URLs and environment variables, indicating data exfiltration points. It installs necessary libraries if missing. Functions are implemented for decrypting stored browser data, extracting cookies, passwords, and tokens from various applications, and uploading this data via web requests and file uploads. Threading is used to process multiple data sources concurrently. There are multiple checks for specific process names and application paths to target popular browsers and wallet applications. The script collects user information, cookies, saved passwords, and encrypted keys, decrypts them, and sends the data to a Discord webhook. It also attempts to kill processes related to known applications, further indicating malicious intent. The code employs obfuscation techniques like misleading function names, variable names, and dynamic code execution, suggesting concealment of its true purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior aimed at data theft and exfiltration. It targets browsers, wallets, and other applications to harvest sensitive information, decrypts and processes this data, and transmits it to external servers. Its structure and obfuscation strongly indicate malicious intent, with no legitimate or benign functionality apparent.",
