{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a highly malicious info-stealer targeting credentials, cookies, tokens, wallet data, and system information. It decrypts stored data from browsers and applications, exfiltrates via webhooks and uploads, and employs process termination and obfuscation techniques to evade detection.",
  "sources": "Local browser data files (e.g., 'Login Data', cookies), local state files, environment variables, user directories, and network requests (IP, geolocation, Discord API).",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST requests to webhooks, file uploads (zip archives), database copying, and process termination commands.",
  "flows": "Data is collected from local storage, decrypted using Windows APIs, then transmitted via network sinks (webhooks, uploads). Threading is used for parallel collection, with process kills to hinder analysis.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with misleading variable names, inconsistent formatting, complex threading, silent dependency installation, and decryption routines. Hardcoded webhook URLs and suspicious URL patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits multiple functions for extracting sensitive data from browsers and wallets, decrypting stored credentials with Windows APIs, and exfiltrating data via webhooks and file uploads. It employs threading for concurrent data collection, process termination to prevent interference, and obfuscation to evade detection. The presence of hardcoded URLs, decryption routines, and extensive file/database handling aligns with typical info-stealer malware. The code's structure and behavior are consistent with malicious intent, with no benign explanations fitting the activities performed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is definitively malicious, functioning as a comprehensive info-stealer targeting credentials, tokens, cookies, and wallet data. It employs obfuscation, process manipulation, and network exfiltration routines characteristic of malware. The overall security risk is extremely high, and the malware score is set to 1.0. Obfuscation is significant but not fully opaque, warranting a score around 0.75. The code should be classified as highly malicious with maximum security concern.",
