  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python project using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Imports 'setuptools' functions; reads package configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data sources or output sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external input to sensitive sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variable names (e.g., jRjQVWCxDHahPplaBBPDWNDpfMopUWCi) and random string 'qqebfmajhnj0d19r' as a version; unusual variable names and values without context.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() with several parameters. The variable names used for parameters are obfuscated or nonsensical, which is atypical for standard setup scripts. The string 'qqebfmajhnj0d19r' appears random and does not conform to typical versioning schemes or static values. No malicious code, network activity, or data leakage mechanisms are evident. The obfuscated variable names and random strings suggest potential attempt at concealment, but there is no direct malicious behavior or malware present. The code solely performs package configuration, with no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names and some unusual string values. There is no clear indication of malicious behavior or malware. The obfuscation may be an attempt to conceal intent, but based on current analysis, it does not pose a security risk.",
