{
  "purpose": "The code is configuring a Python package setup process using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The setup() function call, specifically the arguments and parameters passed to it.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks or malicious actions could occur if any of the arguments were to be used maliciously, but here they are mostly static strings or dictionaries.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into setup() arguments, but these are static values, not influenced by untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variable names such as jRjQVWCxDHahPplaBBPDWNDpfMopUWCi and oQAMZcUddxrNsDGZFJyoKebdtpSUSCxi suggests obfuscation or concealment. The hardcoded string 'qqebfmajhnj0d19r' in place of the package name is unusual and potentially malicious. There is no indication of external data fetching or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup configuration for a Python package with obfuscated variable names. The only suspicious element is the use of obfuscated variable names and a hardcoded package name string, which could be intended to hide malicious intent. No external network activity, data leaks, or malicious actions are evident. The code appears to be static and does not perform any malicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names and a suspicious package name. There is no direct evidence of malicious behavior, but obfuscation and unusual naming warrant caution. The overall risk is low, but further review of the complete package code is recommended.",
