{
  "purpose": "This code defines package metadata for distribution using setuptools, with heavily obfuscated variable names and parameters.",
  "sources": "The setup() function call and its keyword arguments, including package info and metadata.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data flows are present; the code is a static configuration.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, nonsensical strings, and the use of a string as the first argument to setup() (which is invalid syntax), indicating obfuscation or malformed code.",
  "analysis": "The code employs obfuscated variable names and strings, making static analysis difficult. The setup() call appears to use string literals as parameter keys, which is invalid in Python unless variables are assigned accordingly. The presence of a seemingly random string 'qqebfmajhnj0d19r' and obfuscated parameter names suggests an attempt to conceal intent. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or malicious payloads are evident. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not demonstrate malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports reflect high obfuscation (0.7), low malware likelihood (0.0-0.1), and moderate security risk (0.2-0.4). Given the code snippet, the main concern is obfuscation rather than active malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated setup script with no active malicious behavior but with suspicious obfuscation that warrants caution. The overall malware risk is low, but the obfuscation and unusual parameter usage suggest further review is advisable before deployment.",
