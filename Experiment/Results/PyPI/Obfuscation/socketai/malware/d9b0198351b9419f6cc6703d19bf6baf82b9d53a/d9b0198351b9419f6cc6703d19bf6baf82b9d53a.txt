      "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated setup script with no active malicious behavior but with suspicious obfuscation that warrants caution. The overall malware risk is low, but the obfuscation and unusual parameter usage suggest further review is advisable before deployment."

The obfuscation is noted but not concerning in this context. The scores are consistent and appropriate, and no further action is necessary."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is definitively malicious, functioning as a comprehensive info-stealer targeting credentials, tokens, cookies, and wallet data. It employs obfuscation, process manipulation, and network exfiltration routines characteristic of malware. The overall security risk is extremely high, and the malware score is set to 1.0. Obfuscation is significant but not fully opaque, warranting a score around 0.75. The code should be classified as highly malicious with maximum security concern."
