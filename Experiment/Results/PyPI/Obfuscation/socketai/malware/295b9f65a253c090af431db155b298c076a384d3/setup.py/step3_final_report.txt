  "purpose": "The code fetches external Python code via requests and executes it with eval(), then proceeds with package setup. This pattern indicates potential malicious activity or security risk.",
  "sources": "requests.get() fetching code from external URL",
  "sinks": "eval() executing untrusted external code",
  "flows": "requests.get() retrieves code -> eval() executes fetched code",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval() on external data without validation, occurring before setup()",
  "analysis": "The code unconditionally fetches code from a remote URL and executes it with eval(), which is a critical security flaw. This pattern allows remote code execution, potentially leading to system compromise, data theft, or backdoors. The code then calls setup(), but the primary concern is the eval() on untrusted input. The pattern is a classic indicator of malicious or supply chain attack behavior. Scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0.9 to 1, security risk: 0.9 to 1) are justified given the severity. The code is straightforward, not obfuscated, and the risk is high due to remote code execution vulnerability.",
  "conclusion": "The code pattern is highly malicious, enabling remote code execution without validation. All reports correctly identify this pattern and assign high risk scores. The overall assessment should reflect maximum malware and security risk scores (1), with no obfuscation. The code should be flagged as malicious or extremely insecure.",
