  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that installs a module with specified requirements.",
  "sources": "Requests to fetch external code from https://pastebin.com/raw/f84dfw0m",
  "sinks": "Execution of fetched external code via eval()",
  "flows": "requests.get() retrieves code -> eval() executes the code directly",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval() on external data is highly suspicious; no validation or sanitization present; the code fetched could contain malicious instructions.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup from setuptools and requests to manage package installation. It then performs an HTTP GET request to fetch code from an external URL (pastebin). The retrieved code is executed immediately via eval(), which is a significant security risk because it allows arbitrary code execution. Such behavior indicates potential malicious intent, as external code could do anything on the host system, including installing backdoors, exfiltrating data, or damaging files. The rest of the setup call appears standard and benign, but the eval() line overrides this with high risk. Overall, the script relies on dynamic code execution from an external source, which is a common technique in malicious supply chain attacks.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious pattern: fetching and executing external code without validation. This poses a severe security threat, as it allows remote control over the environment executing this script. It should be considered malicious and unsafe for use.",
