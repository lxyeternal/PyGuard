  "purpose": "Set up a Python package with specified dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "The URL in requests.get('https://pastebin.com/raw/f84dfw0m') which fetches external code or data.",
  "sinks": "The eval() function which executes arbitrary code fetched from the external URL.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the external URL through requests.get to eval, allowing remote code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval() on external content, which is highly risky and unusual in secure packaging. The external code could be malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' for packaging and 'requests' to fetch external data. It then performs a GET request to a Pastebin URL and executes the fetched content with eval(), which is a significant security risk as it allows remote code execution. After that, it calls setup() to define package metadata. The critical concern is the eval() of external code, which can run any malicious script or commands.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious eval() of external content, which could lead to remote code execution and malicious activity. This pattern is typical of malicious code insertion and represents a severe security risk. The rest of the code is standard for package setup, but the eval() usage outweighs these positives.",
