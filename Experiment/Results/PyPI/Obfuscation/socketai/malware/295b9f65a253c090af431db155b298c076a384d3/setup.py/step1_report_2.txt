{
  "purpose": "Set up a Python package with specified metadata and execute code fetched from an external URL.",
  "sources": "The code fetches data from 'https://pastebin.com/raw/f84dfw0m' using requests.get() and evaluates it with eval().",
  "sinks": "The eval() function executes arbitrary code received from the external URL, which could lead to remote code execution.",
  "flows": "requests.get() retrieves untrusted external content -> eval() executes this content as Python code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval() on external data is highly suspicious and dangerous, as it can run malicious code. No other anomalies are observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup from setuptools and requests for HTTP requests. It then performs an HTTP GET request to an external URL and executes the returned content with eval(). This pattern is a classic indicator of malicious intent, as it allows remote code execution. The setup() function call appears legitimate, defining package metadata, but it is executed after the eval(), meaning malicious code could run before or during setup execution. The combination of fetching and evaluating external code indicates a high risk of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates clear malicious behavior by executing remote code via eval(), representing a high security risk. The package could be used to run arbitrary malicious scripts on the host system.",
