  "purpose": "To define the setup configuration for a Python package and execute arbitrary code fetched from an external URL.",
  "sources": "The line 'eval(requests.get(...).text)' retrieves code from a remote server and executes it.",
  "sinks": "The eval() function executes the fetched code, which can lead to arbitrary code execution on the system.",
  "flows": "requests.get() fetches code from a URL → eval() executes that code directly.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval() on code fetched from an external source is highly suspicious. No validation or sanitization of the retrieved code is present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup from setuptools and requests for HTTP requests. It then performs an HTTP GET request to a Pastebin URL to retrieve code, which is immediately executed via eval(). This is a classic pattern for executing remote code, potentially malicious. The setup() call follows, but the prior eval() means any code from the URL runs with the script's privileges, possibly installing malicious payloads or backdoors. The use of eval() with external input is a severe security risk, indicating malicious intent or at least very unsafe practice. There are no other obfuscations or security measures. The package name and version are standard, but the eval() significantly undermines security.",
  "conclusion": "The code fetches and executes remote code without validation, representing a high security risk. This pattern is commonly associated with malicious activity such as remote code execution or backdoors. The overall risk is very high.",
