      "conclusion": "The script's core setup appears benign; however, the conditional execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command is highly suspicious and likely malicious. The high obfuscation, silent execution, and concealment tactics justify high malware and risk scores. Further decoding of the command is recommended to confirm malicious intent, but current evidence warrants treating this as a high-threat indicator."
