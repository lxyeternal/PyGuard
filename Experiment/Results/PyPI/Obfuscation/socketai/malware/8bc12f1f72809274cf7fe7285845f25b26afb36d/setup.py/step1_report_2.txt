{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom installation command that downloads a Python script from an obfuscated URL and executes it during the package installation process.",
  "sources": "The code constructs a URL from multiple obfuscated string variables and fetches content using requests.get().",
  "sinks": "The downloaded script is written to 'qrcodegen.py' and immediately executed via subprocess.check_call(), which can execute arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "URL construction from obfuscated strings -> requests.get() retrieves malicious code -> code is written to 'qrcodegen.py' -> subprocess executes the script, leading to potential malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated string variables used to assemble URLs; dynamic code fetched and executed at install time; no clear documentation or validation of fetched content; use of highly obfuscated variable names; indirect string concatenation for URL formation.",
  "analysis": "The code employs multiple obfuscated variables to assemble a URL, which is used to fetch a Python script. The script is saved locally and then executed immediately during package installation, indicating potential malicious behavior. This pattern suggests an attempt to run malicious code silently when the package is installed. The use of obfuscated strings to hide URLs and the execution of remote code at install time are significant red flags. No legitimate setup process would typically perform such actions. The code lacks any validation or verification of fetched content, increasing risk.",
  "conclusion": "The script exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing remote code during package installation, using obfuscation to conceal URL construction. This is indicative of a supply chain attack vector, with a high risk of malicious activity. The code should be considered unsafe and potentially harmful.",
