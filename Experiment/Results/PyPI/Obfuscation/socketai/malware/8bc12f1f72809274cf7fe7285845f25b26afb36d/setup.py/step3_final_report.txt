{
  "purpose": "The code fetches a remote Python script during installation, writes it to a file, and executes it immediately, indicating malicious intent to run arbitrary code during package setup.",
  "sources": "The URL is constructed from obfuscated string variables and fetched via requests.get(). The code reads input from the network (remote URL).",
  "sinks": "The fetched content is written to 'qrcodegen.py' and executed with subprocess.check_call(), which runs the remote code directly.",
  "flows": "The URL constructed from obfuscated variables (source) leads to fetching code via requests, which is then written to a file and executed, forming a direct source-to-sink flow of remote code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names to construct the URL, dynamic code fetch and execution during setup without validation, and immediate execution of remote code are suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs an obfuscated URL from multiple variables, fetches a Python script from this URL, writes it to disk, and executes it during the installation process. This pattern indicates malicious behavior, as it allows arbitrary remote code execution with no validation or signature verification. The obfuscation is likely intended to conceal the malicious source. The behavior aligns with supply chain attack tactics, and the lack of validation increases the risk of executing malicious payloads. The high malware and security risk scores assigned in the reports are justified by this behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates high malicious intent by fetching and executing remote code during package installation, with obfuscation used to hide the source. It poses a severe security risk and should be considered malicious. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should be at the maximum levels, reflecting the high severity of this supply chain attack.",
