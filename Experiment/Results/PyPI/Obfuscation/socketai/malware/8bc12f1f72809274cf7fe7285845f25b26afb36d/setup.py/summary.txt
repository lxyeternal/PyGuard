  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates high malicious intent by fetching and executing remote code during package installation, with obfuscation used to hide the source. It poses a severe security risk and should be considered malicious. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should be at the maximum levels, reflecting the high severity of this supply chain attack."
