{
  "purpose": "Custom setup script that downloads a Python script from a URL and executes it during installation.",
  "sources": "The URL constructed dynamically and used in requests.get() to download code.",
  "sinks": "Writing downloaded code to a file and executing it with subprocess.check_call.",
  "flows": "URL fetch -> save content to 'qrcodegen.py' -> execute 'qrcodegen.py' via subprocess",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically constructs a URL with obfuscated variable names, downloads a script, and executes it without validation or integrity checks.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom installation command that builds a URL from concatenated parts, fetches a remote script, saves it locally as 'qrcodegen.py', and then executes it. The URL construction is obfuscated with multiple variables, which could hide malicious domains or IPs. The code executes downloaded code without verification, indicating potential malicious activity. The use of dynamic URL building and remote code execution during setup suggests malicious intent or supply chain compromise.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits suspicious behavior characteristic of malicious supply chain attacks. It downloads and executes remote code during package installation without any integrity check, which could lead to executing malicious payloads. The obfuscation of URL components further indicates malicious intent.",
