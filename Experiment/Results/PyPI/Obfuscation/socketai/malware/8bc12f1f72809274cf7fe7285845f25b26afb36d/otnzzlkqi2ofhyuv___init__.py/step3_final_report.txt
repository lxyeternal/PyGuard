  "purpose": "Import statements for streaming and audio classes from the 'vidstream' library, likely used for media streaming functionalities.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'vidstream.streaming' and 'vidstream.audio' modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or network operations present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "None, as the code only imports modules without executing or passing data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code consists solely of straightforward import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only import statements importing classes related to streaming and audio functionalities. There is no executable code, data processing, network activity, or user input handling. The 'vidstream' library appears to be a legitimate media streaming library. Given the benign nature of import statements, no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content. The high confidence scores reflect the straightforward and benign nature of the code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of import statements from a legitimate library. There is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities in this snippet. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary based on this code alone.",
