  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the validity of their conclusions, the appropriateness of their scores, and whether any issues are overlooked.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** Only import statements from 'vidstream.streaming' and 'vidstream.audio'; no execution or data handling.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly identifies that these are just import statements with no immediate malicious activity. The malware score of 0 aligns with this. The security risk is minimal given the limited scope.  \n**Verdict:** Valid. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, only imports from 'vidstream' modules related to streaming servers, clients, and audio. No data flow or network activity shown.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the analysis is appropriate. These are standard import statements without evidence of malicious behavior.  \n**Verdict:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Import statements from 'vidstream' for streaming and audio functionalities; no data processing or network code.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with previous assessments. No suspicious activity detected.  \n**Verdict:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Import statements from 'vidstream' modules related to streaming video, camera, screen sharing, and audio. No data flow or executable logic.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is sound. No signs of malicious activity based solely on these imports.  \n**Verdict:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Import statements for streaming and audio classes; no data handling or network code.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAppropriate conclusion; no malicious activity inferred.  \n**Verdict:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Observations & Final Judgment:\n\n- All reports correctly identify that these are benign import statements.\n- The malware scores are consistently 0, which is appropriate given the code.\n- The security risk scores are low (0.1), which seems reasonable since the code alone doesn't perform any risky operations.\n- The confidence levels are high, reflecting the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n\n- While these snippets are benign, the actual risk depends on how these classes are used elsewhere. However, based solely on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious activity.\n- The 'obfuscated' scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- The scores are consistent across reports.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n**Estimated Malware Score:** 0  \n**Estimated Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Estimated Risk Score:** 0.1 (possibly slightly higher if considering the potential for misuse, but given the evidence, staying low)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and their scoring is reasonable. The code is benign import statements from a known streaming library. No further action is necessary based on this snippet alone.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are valid, and the scores align with the benign nature of the code. No malicious or suspicious activity is indicated.",
