  "conclusion": "Most reports are benign or lack sufficient data for assessment. Report 4 shows obfuscation and dynamic execution, indicating moderate suspicion; thus, its malware score should be increased from 0.2 to 0.3. Overall, the scoring is consistent with the analysis, emphasizing caution where obfuscation and dynamic techniques are present."
