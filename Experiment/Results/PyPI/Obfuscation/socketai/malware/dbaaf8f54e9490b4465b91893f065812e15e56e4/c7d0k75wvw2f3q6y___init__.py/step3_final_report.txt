  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code snippets, external data handling, environment variables, string manipulations, dynamic execution functions like eval/exec.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows leading to code execution, data leaks, or external network communication.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input parsing or environment variables to sinks like eval/exec or network functions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation techniques, dynamic code execution, suspicious string patterns, hardcoded URLs/IPs, complex runtime manipulations.",
  "analysis": "The code is evaluated for signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, and security issues. Reports with code snippets show varying levels of suspicion; benign reports lack code or show straightforward logic. Complex, obfuscated code with dynamic execution warrants higher suspicion. Scores are adjusted based on the presence of such techniques, with a particular focus on Report 4, which exhibits obfuscation and dynamic code features. The scores are aligned with the evidence, with slight adjustments to better reflect potential risks.",
  "conclusion": "Most reports are benign or lack sufficient data for assessment. Report 4 shows obfuscation and dynamic execution, indicating moderate suspicion; thus, its malware score should be increased from 0.2 to 0.3. Overall, the scoring is consistent with the analysis, emphasizing caution where obfuscation and dynamic techniques are present.",
