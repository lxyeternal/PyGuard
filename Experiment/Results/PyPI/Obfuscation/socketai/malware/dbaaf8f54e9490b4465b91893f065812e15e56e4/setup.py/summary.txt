  "malware_score": 1.0,
  "security_risk": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0.95,
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious intent, characterized by heavy obfuscation, system modifications, privilege escalation, and potential payload delivery. The high degree of obfuscation and system interaction strongly suggest malicious activity, warranting classification as malware."
