{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up a Python package but also includes malicious activity to establish a reverse shell connection.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file; executing system commands via os.system; writing to 'remote-access.py'; renaming files; executing the malicious script with subprocess.Popen.",
  "sinks": "os.system executing a bash reverse shell; writing and executing 'remote-access.py' which contains the reverse shell code.",
  "flows": "File read ('README.md') -> Writing 'remote-access.py' -> Renaming 'remote-access.py' -> Executing 'remote-access.py' -> Reverse shell connection to 10.3.0.95:4444.",
  "anomalies": "The embedded code contains a hardcoded reverse shell command using bash to connect to an external IP address, and it writes a script that executes this command, indicating malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script starts with a typical setup process but then defines a malicious code block that initiates a reverse shell to an external server. During installation, it writes this malicious code to a file and attempts to execute it, establishing an outbound connection to potentially control the host machine. The code uses subprocess to run the malicious script, which signifies active exploitation. The presence of hardcoded IP and reverse shell commands confirms malicious behavior, and the script automates this process during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains clear malicious activity, establishing a reverse shell connection during installation, which can be used for unauthorized access. This package is malicious and should not be used.",
