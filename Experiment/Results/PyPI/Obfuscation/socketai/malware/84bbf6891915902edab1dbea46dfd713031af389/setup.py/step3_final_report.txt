{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to establish a reverse shell connection during package installation, effectively creating a backdoor for remote access.",
  "sources": "The code reads 'README.md' (though unused), and the malicious payload is embedded directly within the 'Code' string, which is written to 'remote-access.py'. The payload executes via os.system during the install process.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'remote-access.py' via subprocess.Popen allows the reverse shell to connect back to the attacker's IP, enabling remote control or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "The malicious payload is written to a file during setup, then moved to the user's home directory, and executed via subprocess.Popen, establishing an outbound TCP connection to IP 10.3.0.95 on port 4444.",
  "anomalies": "Unnecessary reading of 'README.md', silent exception handling, overwriting existing files without warning, and the straightforward, un-obfuscated reverse shell code are suspicious behaviors. The code is intentionally malicious and explicitly designed for remote access.",
  "analysis": "The code explicitly embeds a reverse shell command in the 'Code' variable, writes it to 'remote-access.py', moves it to the user's home directory, and executes it during setup. The reverse shell connects to a private IP, indicating controlled or internal testing, but in a public context, it signifies malicious intent. The use of os.system with a bash reverse shell, silent exception handling, and overwriting files without warnings are typical tactics to conceal malicious activity. The malware score of 1 is justified due to the active reverse shell payload. The obfuscation score is 0 because the code is straightforward and not obfuscated. The security risk score is 1, as this behavior enables remote control and potential system compromise during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a clear example of supply chain malicious activity, embedding a reverse shell payload that executes during package setup. All reports correctly identify this behavior, assign appropriate high scores for malware and security risk, and note the straightforward nature of the malicious code. The overall assessment confirms a high-severity security threat requiring immediate remediation.",
