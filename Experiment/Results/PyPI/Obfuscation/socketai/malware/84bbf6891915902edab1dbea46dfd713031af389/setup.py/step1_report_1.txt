{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up a Python package and, during installation, create and execute a script that initiates a reverse shell connection to an external IP address.",
  "sources": "The script reads the 'README.md' file (although it doesn't use the content), and defines a string variable 'Code' containing the reverse shell command.",
  "sinks": "The 'Code' string is written to a file 'remote-access.py' and then executed via subprocess, which initiates an outbound network connection to IP 10.3.0.95 on port 4444.",
  "flows": "During setup, the code writes malicious 'reverse shell' code to a file and then executes this file, creating a flow from the code creation to network connection, potentially exfiltrating data or enabling remote access.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains an embedded reverse shell payload that is executed during installation, which is highly unusual and suspicious. The use of os.system with a bash reverse shell command and the automated creation and execution of a remote access script are significant red flags. Also, the code reads 'README.md' but does not utilize its content, indicating potential obfuscation or unnecessary code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup and install tools from setuptools, then defines a string 'Code' that executes a reverse shell by connecting back to IP 10.3.0.95. During the custom 'install' class's run method, it writes this code to 'remote-access.py', moves it to the user's home directory, and executes it with subprocess.Popen. This behavior introduces a remote access capability, which is malicious. The process is automated and embedded within the setup process, which suggests malicious intent to establish remote control without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains embedded malicious behavior designed to establish a reverse shell connection during package installation, representing a clear security threat. The malicious payload is hidden within standard setup procedures, indicating intent to compromise or remotely control affected systems.",
