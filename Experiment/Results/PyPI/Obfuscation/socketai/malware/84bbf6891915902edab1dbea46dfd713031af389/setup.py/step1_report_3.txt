{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to set up a Python package, but it contains malicious behavior to establish a reverse shell connection to a remote server.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.md file and also defines a multi-line string 'Code' which contains a reverse shell command. It also reads and writes files to the user's home directory.",
  "sinks": "The 'Code' string is written to 'remote-access.py' and then executed via subprocess, creating an outbound network connection to an IP address (10.3.0.95) on port 4444.",
  "flows": "The setup script writes malicious code to a file, moves it to the user's home directory, then executes it, creating a flow from file write to network connection establishment.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a hardcoded reverse shell command in a string, writes it to a file during installation, and executes it, which is highly unusual and suspicious in a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools and defines a custom 'install' class that overrides the 'run' method. Within 'run', it writes a reverse shell payload (a Bash command that connects back to a specific IP and port) into a Python script file. It then moves this file into the user's home directory, overwriting if necessary. Finally, it attempts to execute this malicious script via subprocess.Popen, which opens an outbound network connection. This behavior is indicative of malicious intent, aiming to establish remote access during package installation.\n\nThe code also reads the README file, but that appears benign and unrelated to the malicious payload.\n\nThe presence of the hardcoded IP and reverse shell command, combined with the automatic execution during setup, strongly suggests malicious intent or sabotage.\n",
  "conclusion": "The code contains embedded malicious behavior designed to create a reverse shell connection during package installation. It attempts to silently establish remote access, which is highly suspicious and dangerous. The setup script is compromised with embedded malware intended to compromise systems upon installation.",
