{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be a setup configuration for a Python package, with an embedded malicious payload intended to establish a reverse shell connection.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md'; writing to 'remote-access.py'; creating and executing 'remote-access.py' script",
  "sinks": "os.system command executing bash with network connection; subprocess.Popen executing the reverse shell script",
  "flows": "Reading README.md -> Creating 'remote-access.py' with malicious code -> Moving 'remote-access.py' to user's home directory -> Executing 'remote-access.py' via subprocess",
  "anomalies": "Embedded reverse shell payload in variable 'Code'; overwriting 'remote-access.py' in user's home directory; silent exception handling in subprocess call; use of os.system for network connection",
  "analysis": "The code is a setup script that normally would be used to configure a Python package. However, it contains a malicious payload in the variable 'Code', which is a reverse shell command connecting to an external IP address. During installation, it writes this code into a file named 'remote-access.py', moves it to the user's home directory, and then executes it. The use of os.system to initiate a network connection and the creation of a reverse shell are classic malicious behaviors designed for unauthorized remote access. The exception handling suppresses errors, which could mask failure to establish the connection but does not negate the malicious intent. Overall, the code actively performs malicious actions during the package installation process.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is malicious, embedding a reverse shell payload that executes during installation, enabling remote access. It is highly suspicious and should be considered malicious behavior.",
