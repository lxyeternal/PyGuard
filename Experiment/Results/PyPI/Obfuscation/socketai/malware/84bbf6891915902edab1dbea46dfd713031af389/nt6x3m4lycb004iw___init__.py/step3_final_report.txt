  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code input, environment variables, external API calls, data flows from sources to sinks.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file system access, subprocess executions, environment variable usage.",
  "flows": "Sources to sinks, including data transmission, file writes, or environment modifications.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate minimal or no code presence, with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 or 0) are consistent with the limited information. Confidence levels are appropriate, reflecting the amount of code reviewed. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are identified across the reports.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The scoring is justified and consistent with the evidence. Minor adjustment: for reports with no code (3 and 5), risk score can be lowered to 0, as the threat level is negligible. Overall, the assessments are accurate and cautious, aligning with the limited data.",
