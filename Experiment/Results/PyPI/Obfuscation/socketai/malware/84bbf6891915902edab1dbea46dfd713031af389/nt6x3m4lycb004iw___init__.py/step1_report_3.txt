  "purpose": "The code appears to implement a utility or library function, but without the actual code content, its purpose cannot be definitively determined.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are not explicitly visible in the provided snippet; potentially user inputs or external data depending on the context.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include network connections, file writes, or command executions if present in the code, but none are explicitly identified in the snippet provided.",
  "flows": "Without concrete code, it is not possible to trace source-to-sink data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious function calls are visible in the provided snippet. The code structure appears standard; no unusual language features or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The review was conducted on an empty code snippet, which provides no specific sources, sinks, or flows. The absence of visible malicious patterns, suspicious data handling, or anomalies suggests that the code is benign based on the available content. However, the lack of actual code limits a thorough assessment.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided empty code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, but a more detailed review with the actual code content is recommended for certainty.",
