      "conclusion": "The code is a clear example of supply chain malicious activity, embedding a reverse shell payload that executes during package setup. All reports correctly identify this behavior, assign appropriate high scores for malware and security risk, and note the straightforward nature of the malicious code. The overall assessment confirms a high-severity security threat requiring immediate remediation."

      "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The scoring is justified and consistent with the evidence. Minor adjustment: for reports with no code (3 and 5), risk score can be lowered to 0, as the threat level is negligible. Overall, the assessments are accurate and cautious, aligning with the limited data."
