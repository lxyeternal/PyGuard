{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple Python script that performs basic file handling and data processing tasks.",
  "sources": "Reading input data from files or user input (if any), or from environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Writing data to files or printing output; no network transmission observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from source inputs (files or environment) to processing functions and then to outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or obfuscated code detected. The code structure is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard data reading and processing operations without any unusual or complex code constructs. No dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no embedded secrets are found. Usage of standard libraries suggests typical functionality. Lack of external or untrusted inputs that could be exploited minimizes security concerns. No signs of malicious behavior or backdoors are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the code provided, there are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The code performs normal data handling tasks with no suspicious or harmful elements.",
