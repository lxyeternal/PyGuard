  "purpose": "The purpose of this code is to perform a specific function that is not explicitly stated but appears to involve data processing or utility operations.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly defined; no user input, environment variables, or external data reads are evident in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks such as network communication, file writing, or system command execution are present.",
  "flows": "No identifiable source-to-sink data flow paths are evident; the code appears to be self-contained with no data leaks or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, hard-coded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The code uses standard constructs and libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, utilizing standard Python syntax and libraries. There are no signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. It does not contain dynamic code execution, obfuscated segments, or hardcoded credentials. The absence of external interactions and standard coding practices suggest benign behavior.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code appears to be non-malicious, with no apparent security risks or malicious intent. It is a typical, safe Python script without suspicious features.",
