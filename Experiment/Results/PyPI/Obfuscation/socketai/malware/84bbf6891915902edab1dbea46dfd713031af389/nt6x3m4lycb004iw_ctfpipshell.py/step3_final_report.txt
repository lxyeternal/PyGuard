{
  "purpose": "The code performs standard data processing and file handling without any malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Reads input from files, environment variables, and standard input; no external or untrusted sources explicitly indicated.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to files or standard output; no network transmission or sensitive data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (files, env vars) to sinks (files, stdout) without suspicious transformations or external calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses typical Python constructs for data processing, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The absence of network activity, dynamic execution, or suspicious imports supports a benign assessment. The code structure is straightforward, and no anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The malware score is set to 0, obfuscation score to 0, and the security risk score is justified at 0.1, reflecting minimal concern. Confidence in this assessment is high (0.9).",
