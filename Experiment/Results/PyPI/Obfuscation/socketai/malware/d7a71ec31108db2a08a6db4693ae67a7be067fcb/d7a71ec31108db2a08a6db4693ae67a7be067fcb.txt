      "conclusion": "The code exhibits behaviors typical of malicious package components—obfuscated, stealthy execution of commands during setup. The use of encoded PowerShell commands, silent error handling, and background execution strongly suggest malicious intent. The high scores assigned in the reports are justified, and the code should be treated as potentially malicious pending further analysis of the payload."
