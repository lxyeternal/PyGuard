{
  "purpose": "Download an executable file from a specified URL and execute it locally.",
  "sources": "URL request via requests.get(), reading response content, temporary file creation and writing.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.call() executes the downloaded file, running it on the system.",
  "flows": "requests.get() retrieves the file content -> writes to temporary file -> subprocess.call() executes the file.",
  "anomalies": "The code downloads an executable from a Discord CDN URL and immediately executes it without validation or verification, which is highly suspicious. No validation, signature check, or sandboxing is performed before execution. Variable names are obfuscated, which can be a sign of malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script fetches an executable file from an external URL (hosted on Discord) and runs it directly on the host system without any validation, making it potentially malicious. The obfuscated variable names and direct execution suggest malicious intent or at least risky behavior. There are no safeguards, checks, or user prompts; the code executes the downloaded file immediately, which is a common tactic in malware delivery. The code does not contain any obvious benign functionality or legitimate reason for such behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code downloads and executes an external executable without validation, indicating malicious behavior and posing a significant security risk. It appears designed to run arbitrary code from a remote source, which could be used for malicious purposes.",
