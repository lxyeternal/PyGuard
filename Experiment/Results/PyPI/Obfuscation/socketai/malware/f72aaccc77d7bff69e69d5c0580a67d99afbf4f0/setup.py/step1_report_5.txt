{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package with some metadata and dependencies, and then conditionally executes a base64-decoded payload if a certain file does not exist.",
  "sources": "Input sources include the 'os.path.exists' check and the embedded base64 string which is decoded and executed.",
  "sinks": "The decoded payload is executed via 'exec', which can execute arbitrary code, potentially malicious.",
  "flows": "The code flow checks for a file, then decodes and executes hidden code if the file is absent.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated base64-encoded payload executed at runtime; no visible function or purpose for the payload within the source code; the variable names are nonsensical, indicating obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs package setup tasks, which are benign. However, it contains a base64-encoded string that, when decoded, executes arbitrary Python code. This code is hidden and obfuscated, and is triggered conditionally based on the existence of a specific file. This behavior suggests an attempt to hide malicious code or perform hidden actions, possibly a backdoor or data exfiltration routine. The payload's purpose cannot be fully determined without decoding and analyzing the embedded code, but its obfuscated nature and use of 'exec' are typical indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a hidden, obfuscated payload that executes arbitrary code, indicating malicious behavior likely intended to evade detection. The overall structure combines legitimate package setup with concealed malicious activity, making it suspicious.",
