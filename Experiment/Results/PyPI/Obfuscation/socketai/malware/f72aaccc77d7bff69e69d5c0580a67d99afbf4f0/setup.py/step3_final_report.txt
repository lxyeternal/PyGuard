  "purpose": "Detects obfuscated code execution and potential malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Base64-encoded payload decoded and executed via exec(), remote URL fetch within decoded code.",
  "sinks": "exec() executing decoded code, network request fetching remote code, writing to temporary files, executing external processes.",
  "flows": "Base64 payload decoded -> exec() -> remote code fetch -> execute fetched code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding, dynamic execution with exec(), early exit check, obfuscated variable names, remote URL in payload.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with a standard setup, then checks for a specific file and exits if present. If not, it imports modules including requests and base64, then decodes a base64 string which, when executed, imports modules and fetches code from a remote URL, likely executing malicious payloads. The obfuscation and dynamic execution pattern strongly suggest malicious intent, especially remote code fetch and execution. The high obfuscation score reflects the concealment tactics, and the remote fetch indicates potential for remote code execution or backdoor installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and likely malicious, executing remote code from an obfuscated payload. The pattern of obfuscation, remote fetch, and dynamic execution indicates malicious behavior with high confidence. The scores should reflect this high threat level.",
