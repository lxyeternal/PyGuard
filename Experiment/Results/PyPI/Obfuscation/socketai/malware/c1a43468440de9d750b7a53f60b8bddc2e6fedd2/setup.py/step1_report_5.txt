  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'n9b3v40kmziy6kpw' Python package, including reading the README file and specifying dependencies and classifiers.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file, hardcoded string for base64-decoded data, and environment variables (indirectly via exec).",
  "sinks": "exec() function call with dynamically decompressed and decoded code, which executes arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "Base64 decoding and decompression flow leading to exec(), executing the resulting code.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of base64-encoded, compressed data decoded and executed at runtime; no visible clear source code logic for what the decoded code does.",
  "analysis": "The script reads the README.md file for long description. It imports necessary setup modules and specifies package dependencies. Crucially, it contains a significant obfuscated section: a large base64-encoded, lzma-compressed byte string is decoded, decompressed, compiled, and executed via exec(). This approach is often used to hide malicious payloads or obfuscate code. The absence of any inline code logic, combined with the decoding and execution of external, compressed code, indicates potential malicious intent, as this technique is commonly exploited to conceal harmful code. No other suspicious or malicious functions, such as network connections, credential storage, or system modifications, are visible outside this obfuscated segment.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes a potentially malicious obfuscated payload that is decoded, decompressed, and executed dynamically. This behavior is highly suspicious, as it conceals the actual code's intent. Given the context and the obfuscation method, there is a high likelihood of malicious behavior.",
