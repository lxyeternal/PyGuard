{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a setup script for a Python package, primarily intended to configure package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from 'README.md' file and from a base64-encoded, lzma-compressed byte string embedded directly in the script.",
  "sinks": "The code executes a dynamically decompressed and decoded code block using 'exec(compile(...))'.",
  "flows": "The script reads the README.md file, then decodes, decompresses, and executes the embedded payload, which could potentially lead to malicious actions if the payload is harmful.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of embedded base64-encoded, compressed code executed via 'exec'. The payload is opaque and compressed, making it suspicious. Use of 'exec' on decoded data is a strong indicator of obfuscation or malicious intent. Additionally, hardcoded string data that is decoded and run dynamically is unusual in typical setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The initial part of the code imports 'setuptools' and reads 'README.md' into 'long_description', which is standard. The suspicious part begins with importing 'base64' and 'lzma', then decoding and decompressing a large, opaque byte string, which is then executed via 'exec(compile(...))'. This pattern is typical of malicious obfuscation, especially in supply chain attacks, to hide malicious code. The embedded code is not human-readable and is protected by compression and encoding, preventing easy review or understanding of what it does. Since the code executes this payload directly without validation or inspection, there is a high risk that it could perform malicious actions such as system compromise, data exfiltration, or creating backdoors. There are no other signs of malicious activity outside this dynamic code execution, but the obfuscation itself is a significant concern.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains malicious obfuscation by embedding compressed and encoded code executed at runtime. This behavior indicates a high likelihood of malicious intent or sabotage. The setup process is being exploited to run hidden, potentially harmful code, making this package extremely dangerous to use.",
