  "purpose": "A simple delay function that pauses execution for a specified amount of time.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'amount' passed to the function.",
  "sinks": "The 'time.sleep()' call, which causes the program to delay; no untrusted data flows to other sinks.",
  "flows": "Input 'amount' flows directly into 'time.sleep()' to induce delay.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function name; no other anomalies or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward function that calls 'time.sleep()' with an input parameter, causing a delay. The function name is obfuscated but the code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity, data leaks, or network operations. The obfuscation is minimal and does not imply malicious intent. The delay could be misused for denial-of-service or performance hindrance, but in isolation, it is not malicious. Scores from reports align with this assessment, assigning malware score 0, low security risk, and moderate obfuscation. The overall behavior is benign, with potential for misuse in specific contexts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing only a delay. No malicious activity or malware is present. Obfuscation is minimal and does not indicate malicious intent. The risk is low, but the function could be misused to cause delays or DoS. Overall, the code is safe, with scores reflecting cautiousness due to obfuscation and potential misuse.",
