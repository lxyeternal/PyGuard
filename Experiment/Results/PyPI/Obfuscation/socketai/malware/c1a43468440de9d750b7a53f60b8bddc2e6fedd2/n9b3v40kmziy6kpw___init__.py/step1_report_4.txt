{
  "purpose": "The function delays execution by sleeping for a specified amount of time.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'amount' used as argument to time.sleep()",
  "sinks": "time.sleep() call, which pauses execution but does not directly lead to data leaks or malicious actions",
  "flows": "Input 'amount' flows directly into time.sleep(), causing execution delay",
  "anomalies": "The function name appears obfuscated and does not indicate a clear purpose; no other code present that manipulates data or performs malicious actions",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function that causes a delay based on the input parameter. There are no hardcoded credentials, network calls, data exfiltration, or suspicious behaviors. The obfuscated function name suggests it might be designed to hide intent, but with no further context, it appears benign. The use of time.sleep() itself is not malicious but can be used for delays or throttling. No malicious code, backdoors, or malware signals are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is simple and benign, performing a delay based on the input. The obfuscated name alone does not indicate malicious intent. No security risks or malware are detected.",
