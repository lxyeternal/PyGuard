{
  "purpose": "The function vezkCdrvHMZlGuckKZxhhfKPTiqEdVNR is designed to pause execution for a specified amount of time.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'amount' passed to the function, used in time.sleep()",
  "sinks": "time.sleep() call, which can delay execution but does not inherently leak data or perform harmful actions",
  "flows": "The 'amount' parameter flows directly into time.sleep(), with no other processing or data handling",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no unusual code patterns, and no obfuscated code present; function name is obfuscated but that alone is not suspicious",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that calls time.sleep() with a parameter. It introduces a delay based on the input but does not perform any data leakage, malicious activity, or system compromise. The obfuscated function name could suggest intent to hide, but alone it is not evidence of malicious behavior. No external network communication or data access occurs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving only to introduce a delay. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks in this snippet.",
