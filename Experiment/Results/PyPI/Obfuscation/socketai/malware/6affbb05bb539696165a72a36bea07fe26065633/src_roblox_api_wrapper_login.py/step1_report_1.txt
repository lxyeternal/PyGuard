  "purpose": "The code appears to define two placeholder functions, possibly intended for handling cookies and user credentials.",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'cookie', 'username', and 'password' serve as input sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks present; the functions are empty and do not process or output data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows within the code, as the functions are empty and do not perform any operations.",
  "anomalies": "Functions are defined with obfuscated or nonsensical names, and contain no implementation, which could be a sign of obfuscation or incomplete code. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two empty functions with obfuscated names, serving as placeholders. There is no logic, data handling, or behavior that could be malicious. The naming and structure suggest possible code hiding or incomplete development, but no malicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is non-functional and appears to be placeholder or obfuscated code with no malicious intent or security risks. No active behavior or vulnerabilities are detected.",
