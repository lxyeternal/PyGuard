{
  "purpose": "Placeholder functions with obfuscated or nonsensical names, no logic or data handling.",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'cookie', 'username', 'password' (potential data sources), but unused.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external calls; functions are inert.",
  "flows": "No data flow; functions are empty.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function names, but no active malicious behavior or obfuscation techniques.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two empty functions with obfuscated names, accepting parameters that could carry sensitive data but not utilizing them. No logic, data flow, or external interactions are present. The obfuscated names suggest potential concealment, but without implementation, there's no malicious activity. The scores from reports correctly reflect the inert nature: malware=0, obfuscated=0.7, securityRisk=0.1. The high obfuscation score is justified by the nonsensical names, and the low security risk acknowledges the absence of active code or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is inert placeholder functions with obfuscated names, posing no active security threat. The scores are appropriate; minor obfuscation is present, but no malicious intent or vulnerabilities are detected.",
