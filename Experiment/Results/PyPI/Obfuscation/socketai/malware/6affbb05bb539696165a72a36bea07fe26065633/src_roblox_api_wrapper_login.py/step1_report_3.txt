{
  "purpose": "Placeholder functions with no implementation, potentially designed for authentication or user data handling.",
  "sources": "No data sources are read; functions do not contain any code that processes input or external data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to external systems are present in the code.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink flows exist as functions are empty and do not perform any operations.",
  "anomalies": "Functions are defined with non-descriptive, seemingly random names; no internal logic or comments. No evidence of obfuscation or malicious code within the provided snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code contains two function definitions with obfuscated or meaningless names and no implementation. There are no data sources, sinks, or flows. The absence of code behavior makes it impossible for malicious activity to be present within this fragment. The naming might suggest an intent to obscure, but without implementation, this is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal, non-functional, and does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet. It appears to be placeholder or stub functions with no active logic.",
