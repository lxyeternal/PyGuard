  "purpose": "Placeholder functions with no implementation, likely intended for handling cookies and user credentials.",
  "sources": "Function parameters: 'cookie', 'username', 'password' (potentially untrusted input sources).",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing; functions are empty and do not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flows occur as functions are empty; no operations or data manipulation present.",
  "anomalies": "Functions are defined but contain no code; no input validation, no processing, and no side effects.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two function definitions with cryptic names and no implementation details. There are no data processing, no network calls, no credential handling, and no obfuscated or malicious code present. The presence of these functions alone does not indicate malicious intent; they are simply placeholders. The absence of any logic suggests no malicious activity or security risks based on the provided code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is essentially a stub with no operational content. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be incomplete or intentionally minimal. Based on current analysis, no security concerns are identified.",
