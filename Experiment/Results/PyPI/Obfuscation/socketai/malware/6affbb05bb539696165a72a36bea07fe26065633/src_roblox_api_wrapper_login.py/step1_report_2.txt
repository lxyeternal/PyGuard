  "purpose": "Placeholder functions with no implementation, likely intended for handling cookies and user credentials.",
  "sources": "Parameters 'cookie', 'username', 'password' which suggest input of sensitive data.",
  "sinks": "No actual data processing, storage, or output operations are present in the functions.",
  "flows": "No executable code or data flow; functions are empty.",
  "anomalies": "Functions are defined but contain no logic, no handling, or processing of data. No obfuscated or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions that accept inputs likely related to authentication or session management but do not perform any operations. There are no data manipulations, external calls, or suspicious behaviors. The lack of implementation may suggest placeholder code or incomplete development. No signs of malicious activity, data leaks, or obfuscation are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and appears to be placeholders without any malicious intent. No security issues or malware indications are present based on this fragment.",
