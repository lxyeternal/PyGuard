{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be setting up a Python package named 'roblox-python-wrapper' and then executing base64-decoded code, likely to perform additional operations.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata and the base64-encoded string which contains executable code.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing decoded code, and the decoded code writing to files, opening URLs, and possibly executing system commands.",
  "flows": "The package setup is straightforward, then the code decodes base64 string -> executes it, which then performs network requests, file writes, and possibly other actions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on base64-decoded data is suspicious; it may be obfuscating malicious code. Multiple imports of 'base64' are redundant. The decoded code performs network requests to a hardcoded URL, writes files, and uses system operations.",
  "analysis": "The initial part sets up a Python package with standard metadata. The presence of exec() on a base64-encoded string is suspicious because it obfuscates the actual code being run. Decoding the string reveals code that performs network requests to a specified URL, writes content to files, and interacts with system files and processes. Such behavior is typical of malicious scripts aiming to download and execute additional payloads or establish backdoors. The code does not contain obvious hardcoded credentials but uses obfuscation and dynamic execution techniques typical of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code uses obfuscation to hide malicious behavior, including network communications and file system modifications. Its primary purpose appears to be executing hidden code that could perform harmful actions, such as downloading payloads or establishing backdoors. Due to the use of exec() on decoded data and network interactions, it warrants a high suspicion level.",
