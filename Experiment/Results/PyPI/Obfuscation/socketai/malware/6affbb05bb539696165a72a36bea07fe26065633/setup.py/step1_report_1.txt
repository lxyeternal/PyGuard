{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package called 'roblox-python-wrapper' and then execute embedded base64-encoded code, which likely performs additional actions.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the package setup parameters and decodes embedded base64-encoded code string.",
  "sinks": "The decoded base64 code is executed via exec(), which can run arbitrary and potentially malicious code.",
  "flows": "The package setup process occurs normally, then the base64 string is decoded and executed, which can lead to execution of malicious payloads embedded within the base64 string.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on a base64-encoded string is suspicious and common in obfuscated or malicious scripts. The code also imports 'os' and 'sys' but does not directly use them in the visible code, indicating possible obfuscation or hidden functionality.",
  "analysis": "The script first performs a typical package setup using setuptools, which is legitimate. However, immediately afterward, it imports base64 again and decodes a long base64 string, executing the decoded code with exec(). The decoded code, once examined, appears to perform network requests, potentially sending system or user data to external servers, and manipulating or retrieving content covertly. This pattern indicates obfuscation intended to hide malicious behavior. The use of exec() on embedded code and the presence of encoded payloads are classic indicators of malicious intent. No other legitimate functionality is apparent for the embedded code, and the package setup itself seems normal.\n\nOverall, the code contains suspicious obfuscation and executable payload that could lead to malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "This code likely contains malicious payload hidden within an obfuscated base64 string, executed via exec(). The setup process appears normal, but the embedded code's purpose is potentially harmful, involving network communication or data exfiltration. The script warrants caution, and the payload should be thoroughly analyzed in a controlled environment before any use.",
