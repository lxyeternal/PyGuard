  "purpose": "Setup and package configuration for 'roblox-python-wrapper' with embedded obfuscated code execution.",
  "sources": "Base64-encoded string decoded and executed via exec(), URL, and environment variable reads.",
  "sinks": "exec() call executing decoded code, URL request, file write operations, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Base64 decoding -> exec() executes code that makes URL request and writes to file.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on dynamically decoded Base64 code; obfuscated code; multiple imports; hidden URL and environment variable usage.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with standard package setup code using setuptools. It then imports base64 again (redundant). The critical part is the exec() function that decodes and executes a Base64 string, which appears to contain obfuscated code. Inside the decoded code, it makes an HTTP request to a URL, reads the response, and writes content to a file, indicating potential data exfiltration or malicious payload delivery. It also accesses environment variables and potentially manipulates files, which could be malicious depending on context. The obfuscation and use of exec() on dynamically decoded code are common tactics for hiding malicious intent. There are no explicit hardcoded credentials or obvious backdoors, but the pattern is suspicious due to obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated execution of dynamically decoded code that performs network requests and file operations, suggesting potential malicious activity. The setup code appears benign, but the presence of exec() on an encoded string is a significant red flag. It warrants caution, as the embedded code could perform unauthorized actions.",
