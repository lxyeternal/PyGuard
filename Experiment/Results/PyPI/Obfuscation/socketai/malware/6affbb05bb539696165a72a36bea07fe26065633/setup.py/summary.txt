  "conclusion": "The code contains an obfuscated payload executed via exec(), performing network requests and file operations indicative of malicious activity. The package setup appears legitimate but is likely a delivery mechanism for malicious code. The high malware, obfuscation, and risk scores are justified based on the observed behaviors."
