{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package named 'roblox-python-wrapper' and then executes obfuscated code, likely to perform additional actions.",
  "sources": "Reading input from the base64-encoded string that is decoded and executed.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decoded code via exec(), writing files, and potential network requests (implied by import statements and functions).",
  "flows": "Decoded base64 data is executed with exec(), which may lead to further actions like network access, file manipulation, or data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding combined with exec() is a strong indicator of obfuscated or malicious intent. The decoded content likely contains further malicious payloads or backdoors. No clear documentation or comments explaining the purpose of the decoded code.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with setting up a Python package via setuptools. It then imports base64 and proceeds to decode a base64 string, which is executed immediately with exec(). The decoded payload is also manipulating request headers, making network requests, and writing to files, all of which are common behaviors in malicious scripts. The use of base64 encoding and exec() indicates obfuscation and a potential attempt to hide malicious actions. The package itself seems benign, but the embedded decoded code suggests malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code uses obfuscation techniques to hide malicious payloads that are executed dynamically, indicating high suspicion of malicious intent. The decoded code appears to perform actions consistent with malware, such as network requests and file manipulations, making this package potentially dangerous.",
