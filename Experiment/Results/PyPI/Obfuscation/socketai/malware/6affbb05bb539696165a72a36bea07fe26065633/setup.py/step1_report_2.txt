{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package named 'roblox-python-wrapper' and then executes decoded base64 content, likely to perform additional actions.",
  "sources": "Input is read from the 'src' directory during package setup; data is also read from the embedded base64 string for execution.",
  "sinks": "The base64 decoded code is executed directly via exec(), which can lead to executing malicious code if the decoded content is harmful.",
  "flows": "The script first performs package setup, then decodes base64 data, which is executed, leading to potential execution of malicious code embedded within the base64 string.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on dynamically decoded data is suspicious, especially since the decoded content is obfuscated and may contain malicious payloads. Repeated import of 'base64' is unnecessary.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup using setuptools, then decodes a base64-encoded string and executes it. The decoded code appears to perform HTTP requests, possibly to exfiltrate data or perform other malicious actions. The obfuscation via base64 and subsequent execution indicates malicious intent or at least a significant security risk. The repeated import of 'base64' and the obfuscation suggest an attempt to hide behavior. Overall, the code's primary purpose seems to be installing a package and then executing concealed code, which is a common tactic in malicious scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code combines legitimate package setup with obfuscated, dynamically executed code, raising strong suspicion of malicious intent. The use of exec() on decoded content and obfuscation techniques are significant security concerns.",
