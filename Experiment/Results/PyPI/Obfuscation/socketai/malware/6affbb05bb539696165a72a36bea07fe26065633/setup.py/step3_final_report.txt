{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package named 'roblox-python-wrapper' using setuptools, then decodes and executes an obfuscated payload via base64 and exec(). The payload performs network requests and file operations, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The base64-encoded string decoded from the long string literal, which is executed via exec().",
  "sinks": "The exec() function executing the decoded payload; within the payload, network requests, file writes, and environment manipulations are potential data exfiltration or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The code reads the base64 string, decodes it, and passes it directly to exec(), which then performs network and file operations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding combined with exec() on an obfuscated payload; redundant import of base64; the payload's content is hidden and performs network requests and file operations.",
  "analysis": "The initial setup code is legitimate. The suspicious activity begins with decoding a base64 string and executing it dynamically. The decoded code, once examined, shows network requests and file manipulations, typical of malicious payloads. The pattern of obfuscation and dynamic execution strongly suggests malicious intent. The high scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.85, obfuscated ~0.9, security risk ~0.85) are justified by these behaviors. The code's obfuscation and network activity warrant high suspicion, and static analysis indicates potential malicious behavior. The use of exec() on encoded payloads is a classic malware indicator. Overall, the code should be treated as malicious until further analysis confirms otherwise.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains an obfuscated payload executed via exec(), performing network requests and file operations indicative of malicious activity. The package setup appears legitimate but is likely a delivery mechanism for malicious code. The high malware, obfuscation, and risk scores are justified based on the observed behaviors.",
