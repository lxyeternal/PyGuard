  "purpose": "Detects suspicious behavior of executing an encoded PowerShell command during package setup, potentially indicating malicious activity.",
  "sources": "Filesystem check for 'tahg' directory; subprocess call executing a base64-encoded PowerShell command.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the encoded PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen, which can lead to code execution or payload delivery.",
  "flows": "Filesystem check -> Conditional branch -> Execution of encoded PowerShell command in subprocess if 'tahg' absent.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64-encoded, obfuscated PowerShell command; execution in hidden window; silent exception handling suppressing errors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard setup but includes a suspicious conditional that triggers execution of an obfuscated, encoded PowerShell command in a hidden window, with silent error handling. This pattern is typical of malicious payloads aiming to run covertly during installation. The obfuscation and stealth increase suspicion. The silent failure handling prevents detection of errors, further masking malicious intent. The overall behavior aligns with common supply chain attack techniques or malware delivery methods.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious intent due to covert, obfuscated PowerShell execution during setup. The pattern suggests potential malware or backdoor activity, justified by high obfuscation and stealth scores. Further decoding of the payload is recommended for confirmation, but current evidence warrants caution.",
