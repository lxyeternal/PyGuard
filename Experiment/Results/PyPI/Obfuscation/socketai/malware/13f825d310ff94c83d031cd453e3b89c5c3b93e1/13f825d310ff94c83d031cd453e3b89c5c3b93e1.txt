      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious intent due to covert, obfuscated PowerShell execution during setup. The pattern suggests potential malware or backdoor activity, justified by high obfuscation and stealth scores. Further decoding of the payload is recommended for confirmation, but current evidence warrants caution."
