  "purpose": "The code is used to set up and install a Python package with specified dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading from 'setuptools' for package setup and a hardcoded version string.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network connections, file writes, or data leaks are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of an unusual variable name 'GKOOrZEIEgxGrjejpRfGPwkAiJWyqZxx', which is a random string assigned to a version variable. No explicit malicious code or backdoors are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' to define package setup parameters. It assigns a seemingly random string to a variable intended as a version indicator. The setup() function specifies package name and dependencies. There are no suspicious network activities, code injections, or malicious patterns detected. The unusual variable name might suggest obfuscation, but it appears benign and unused elsewhere. The dependencies listed include common libraries, with some that could be used maliciously if misused (like 'browser_cookie3', 'discordwebhook', 'robloxpy', 'requests'), but their presence alone doesn't indicate malicious intent in this code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package with no clear malicious behavior. The unusual variable name is suspicious but not inherently malicious. No malware indicators are present, and the setup process is standard.",
