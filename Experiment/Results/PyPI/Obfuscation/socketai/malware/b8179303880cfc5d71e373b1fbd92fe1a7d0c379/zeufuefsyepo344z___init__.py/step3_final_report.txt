{
  "purpose": "The code extracts Roblox cookies from various browsers, validates them, retrieves user information, and exfiltrates this data to a Discord webhook, indicating malicious intent to steal user credentials and personal data.",
  "sources": "Browser cookie storage locations (firefox, chromium, edge, opera, chrome) where cookies named '.ROBLOSECURITY' are read.",
  "sinks": "Requests to the Discord webhook URL with user cookies and info, and external API calls for validation and user data retrieval.",
  "flows": "Cookies are read from browser storage -> cookies are validated via Roblox API -> user info is fetched -> data is formatted and sent via POST request to webhook.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple silent try-except blocks hiding errors, obfuscated variable names, hardcoded webhook URL, references to undefined variables like 'roblox_cookie', inconsistent appending of cookie data, and broad cookie access across multiple browsers.",
  "analysis": "The script's core behavior involves harvesting Roblox cookies from multiple browsers, validating them, fetching user details, and exfiltrating this information to an external Discord webhook. The use of silent exception handling and obfuscated variable names suggests an intent to conceal malicious activity. The hardcoded webhook URL and the collection of sensitive user data without consent further confirm malicious intent. The code's structure and behavior align with known cookie-stealing malware designed for privacy invasion and credential theft.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a highly malicious cookie stealer targeting Roblox users, designed to exfiltrate sensitive data to an external server. Its obfuscation, silent error handling, and data exfiltration confirm a high threat level.",
