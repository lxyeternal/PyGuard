{
  "purpose": "The script appears to extract Roblox cookies from various browsers, validate the cookie, gather user information, and then send this data to a Discord webhook, possibly for profiling or unauthorized data collection.",
  "sources": "Reads browser cookies (.ROBLOSECURITY), reads system IP address, fetches Roblox user data via API requests, reads environment variables and cookies.",
  "sinks": "Sends data to a Discord webhook URL, posts to Roblox APIs with the cookie, and potentially sends user data and cookie info over the network.",
  "flows": "Browser cookies (source) are used to validate and extract Roblox user info, which is then combined with external IP info and sent via webhook (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Uses multiple 'try-except' blocks without handling exceptions explicitly, possibly to suppress errors; constructs URLs and messages with user info, including Roblox cookies, which could be malicious. The variable 'roblox_cookie' is used but not defined in the provided code, indicating possible incomplete or obfuscated code. It appears to collect sensitive info and send it externally, which is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code collects Roblox cookies from various browsers, implying access to stored authentication tokens. It validates the cookie and retrieves user info via Roblox API. The gathered data includes user ID, username, rap, friends count, creation date, and headshot. It constructs a message including the cookie and user info, then sends it to a Discord webhook. The use of multiple browser cookie sources and the direct transmission of cookies to external servers suggest malicious intent, primarily data exfiltration. The presence of undefined variables and inconsistent code formatting indicate possible obfuscation or incomplete code. Overall, the script is designed to steal user cookies and private info for malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a cookie stealer and data exfiltration tool targeting Roblox users, collecting sensitive information and sending it to an external webhook. The script demonstrates malicious behavior with high confidence due to its data theft and exfiltration activities.",
