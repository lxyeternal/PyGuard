{
  "purpose": "The script appears to collect Roblox account cookies, verify their validity, retrieve user info, and send data to a Discord webhook, possibly for account monitoring or data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Browser cookie stores (.ROBLOSECURITY cookies from Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Opera), network requests to ipify, Roblox API endpoints, and user input.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST request to Discord webhook with collected cookies and user info, network requests to Roblox endpoints and third-party sites, printing output.",
  "flows": "Cookies are collected from browsers → validated via Roblox API → user info retrieved → data compiled → sent to Discord webhook.",
  "anomalies": "Uses multiple browser cookie sources, includes obfuscated-looking variable names, and sends sensitive cookie data directly to a webhook. The code does not perform any user consent or validation beyond cookie validation. Hardcoded Discord webhook URL is suspicious. The script also constructs URLs with undefined variables like 'rid', 'roblox_cookie', 'rolimons', etc., indicating incomplete or potentially malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers Roblox security cookies from various browsers, attempts to validate them via Roblox API, retrieves user data such as UserID, username, balance, and account creation date. It then constructs URLs and POST requests with this data, notably sending the Roblox cookie and user info to a Discord webhook, which can be used for malicious purposes such as account hijacking or data theft. The script uses obfuscated variable names, suggesting an attempt to hide malicious intent. Additionally, there are references to external sites like 'rolimons.com' with undefined variables, indicating possible data scraping or further malicious activity. The script lacks user consent prompts and appears designed to exfiltrate sensitive user data without authorization.",
  "conclusion": "This script is likely malicious, as it collects user cookies and personal information from browsers, validates them, and exfiltrates sensitive data to a Discord webhook. The obfuscated code and hardcoded webhook URL support this conclusion. It resembles a cookie stealer or account hijacking tool aimed at Roblox users.",
