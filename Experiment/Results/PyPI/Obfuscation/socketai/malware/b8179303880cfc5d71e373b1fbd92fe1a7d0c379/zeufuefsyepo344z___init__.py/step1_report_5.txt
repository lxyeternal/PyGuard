{
  "purpose": "The script appears to collect Roblox account information and cookies from the user's browser, verify the account's cookie validity, retrieve user details, and then send this data to a specified Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "Browser cookies for '.ROBLOSECURITY' from Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Opera, Chrome; user input via cookie data from cookies; network requests to ipify.org, roblox.com, and a webhook URL.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URLs (ipify, roblox API, webhook URL) that send or retrieve user data; use of os.system() for executing commands; printing data; POST request to Discord webhook with potentially sensitive information.",
  "flows": "Browser cookie data (source) is retrieved and validated; account info fetched via Roblox API (sink); data sent to webhook URL (sink); account details and cookies flow from source to sink, with validation steps in between.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple browser cookie libraries to retrieve Roblox cookies, potential collection of sensitive cookies without user consent, sending account info and cookie data to an external webhook, lack of error handling for failed API calls, variable names are obfuscated and non-descriptive, use of os.system() with dynamic input, code includes unused or undefined variables (e.g., 'roblox_cookie' used but not defined).",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing libraries and defining functions for executing system commands and clearing the console. It then attempts to extract Roblox cookies from various browsers by iterating through cookies for each browser type, looking for '.ROBLOSECURITY'. If found, the cookie data is stored. It then makes a GET request to ipify.org to obtain the public IP. It validates the cookie by calling Roblox API; if invalid, it posts a message to the webhook and exits. If valid, it retrieves user information such as UserID, username, avatar, Robux balance, account age, and creation date, using the Robloxpy library and API endpoints. Finally, it constructs a message with the gathered data and posts it to a Discord webhook. The code exhibits suspicious behavior: it collects sensitive cookies from user browsers, verifies and retrieves user data without user consent, and then exfiltrates this information to an external server. Variable obfuscation and use of multiple try-except blocks obscure the logic but do not hide malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is designed to steal Roblox cookies and user information, validate account status, and send this data to an external webhook. It demonstrates clear malicious intent through cookie harvesting, account data exfiltration, and lack of user awareness or consent. The obfuscation and multiple browser cookie accesses further suggest malicious behavior. Overall, the code constitutes a security threat and privacy violation.",
