  "purpose": "Assess supply chain security risks of the open source dependency based on provided code analysis summaries.",
  "sources": "No actual code snippets provided; analysis based on summaries and patterns mentioned.",
  "sinks": "Potential dynamic execution points (eval, exec), input handling functions, network communication, data storage or leakage points.",
  "flows": "Not explicitly available; analysis relies on pattern descriptions rather than concrete source-to-sink flows.",
  "anomalies": "Mention of dynamic execution (eval, exec), unvalidated inputs, suspicious patterns without confirmation; no concrete obfuscation or malicious code confirmed.",
  "analysis": "All reports lack actual code snippets, limiting definitive conclusions. Reports 1-3 and 5 show no suspicious activity, with low confidence scores (0.2-0.4) and minimal risk (0-0.2). Report 4 mentions patterns like eval/exec and unvalidated inputs, indicating suspicion; scores of malware=0.3-0.4 and risk=0.4 are justified but slightly high given no confirmed malicious code. Adjustments recommend lowering malware to 0.2 for report 4 and risk to 0.2, aligning scores with the evidence level. Overall, scores are mostly appropriate but can be refined to better reflect the absence of confirmed malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The assessments are consistent with the limited evidence; suspicion in report 4 warrants a slightly higher malware score, but overall, all reports reflect low risk and malware likelihood due to lack of concrete code evidence. Minor score adjustments improve accuracy.",
