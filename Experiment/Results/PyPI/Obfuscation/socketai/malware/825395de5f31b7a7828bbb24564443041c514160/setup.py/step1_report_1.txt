{
  "purpose": "Define a setup script for a Python package that includes a custom install command potentially used to execute malicious code post-installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the base64 encoded string, and environment variables are manipulated in the subprocess command.",
  "sinks": "Execution of os.system with a decoded base64 string that executes a remote connection to an external server, potentially a backdoor.",
  "flows": "The custom install method constructs a reverse shell command, encodes it in base64, then decodes and executes it via os.system, establishing remote access.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated class and method names; base64 encoding of a shell command that connects to an external server; execution of this command during package installation; the remote server domain appears suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class inheriting from setuptools' install command. During installation, it constructs a reverse shell command aimed at a specific external server ('e6j4342057.zicp.fun') with a port number 26264. This command is base64-encoded and then decoded and executed via os.system, which could establish a remote connection and provide shell access to an attacker. The obfuscated class and method names, along with the inline command that spawns a bash shell over a network connection, are suspicious. The code does not appear to be related to legitimate package functionality and instead contains logic consistent with a malicious backdoor or remote access trojan, activated during installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by executing a remote reverse shell during package installation, indicating an embedded backdoor. The obfuscation and execution of external network commands strongly suggest malicious intent. This package should be considered dangerous and not used.",
