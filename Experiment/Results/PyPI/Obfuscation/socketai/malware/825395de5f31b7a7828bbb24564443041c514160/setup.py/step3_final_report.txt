{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to execute a reverse shell connection to an external server during package installation, indicating malicious backdoor behavior.",
  "sources": "The method obwDOxfnRQyURynHGfMVodIkrWGDdwZU constructs the reverse shell command, with the domain and port hardcoded; the command is base64-encoded and decoded at runtime.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executes the decoded reverse shell command, establishing a network connection to the specified external server, enabling remote code execution.",
  "flows": "Source: construction of the reverse shell command -> encoding in base64 -> decoding during runtime -> execution via os.system -> connection to external server and spawning of bash shell.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names; hardcoded suspicious domain and port; use of base64 encoding to hide malicious payload; execution during package installation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, during installation, constructs a reverse shell command targeting 'e6j4342057.zicp.fun' on port 26264. The command involves socket connection and spawning a bash shell, encoded in base64 to evade detection. It executes this payload via os.system, establishing a remote access backdoor. The obfuscation of class/method names and the hardcoded malicious domain strongly indicate malicious intent. The behavior aligns with known supply chain attack patterns, providing remote control over the host system. The malware score is set to 1, the obfuscation score is high (~0.8-1), and the security risk score is also 1, reflecting the high severity of the threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a clear malicious backdoor that executes a reverse shell during package installation, with obfuscation and hardcoded malicious domain. The scores of 1 for malware and security risk are justified. The package should be flagged as malicious and avoided.",
