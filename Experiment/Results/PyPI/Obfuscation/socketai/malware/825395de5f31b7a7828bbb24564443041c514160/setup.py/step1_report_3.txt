{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom setup installation process that includes a potentially malicious payload designed to establish a reverse shell connection to a remote server.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables, hardcoded server address, and base64 encoded commands; it also reads system environment during execution.",
  "sinks": "The code executes a decoded base64 command via os.system, which initiates a reverse shell connection to a specified IP and port, and spawns a bash shell.",
  "flows": "Source (hardcoded server info and environment variables) → decode base64 payload → execute command with os.system → establish reverse shell connection.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated, base64-encoded code that creates a reverse shell, use of socket programming and process duplication, hardcoded malicious server address, and payload that executes a bash shell remotely.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools and defines a custom install command class. Within the class, a method constructs a base64-encoded string containing a reverse shell command that connects to a specific IP ('e6j4342057.zicp.fun') on port 26264. It then decodes and executes this command via os.system, which results in establishing a reverse shell to the attacker-controlled server. The base64 encoding and execution pattern are typical of obfuscation used to hide malicious intent. The presence of a remote shell payload strongly indicates malicious behavior, as it can allow remote control over the host system. The code appears designed to be executed during package installation, making it a supply chain attack vector. All indicators point to malicious intent with no benign purpose evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains a clear malicious payload that, upon installation, connects to an external server and provides remote shell access. It employs obfuscation and stealth techniques, indicating malicious intent with a high level of confidence.",
