{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up a Python package, but it includes a custom install command that executes potentially malicious network activity during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the base64-encoded string containing a shell command and executes it via os.system.",
  "sinks": "The encoded command, once decoded, opens a reverse shell to a specified host and port, allowing remote control of the system.",
  "flows": "The code encodes a reverse shell command, decodes it at runtime, and executes it, leading to remote access.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names, encoding and execution of network-related shell commands, and the use of base64 encoding to hide malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a setup configuration for a Python package with specific classifiers. It creates a subclass of 'install' that, during installation, encodes a reverse shell payload designed to connect to a remote server at 'e6j4342057.zicp.fun' on port 26264. The payload is base64-encoded, then decoded and executed using os.system, which executes a bash reverse shell, giving control over the host. The code appears to be intentionally obfuscated, with misleading naming and dynamic execution of network code, indicating malicious intent. No legitimate functionality is visible, and the network activity is clearly designed for remote compromise.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains malicious behavior: it executes a reverse shell connecting to an external server during package installation, which is highly suspicious and likely malicious. The obfuscation and network activity strongly suggest an intent to compromise systems where the package is installed.",
