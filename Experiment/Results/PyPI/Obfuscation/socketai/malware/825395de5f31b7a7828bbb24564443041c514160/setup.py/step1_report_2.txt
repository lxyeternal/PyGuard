{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be setting up a Python package, but it includes a custom install command that executes a potentially malicious reverse shell payload.",
  "sources": "The code reads a base64-encoded command string from the variable RkqqpUTDjfaRKeJgHOnGgxQLEiTPXARv, which is then decoded and executed via os.system. The initial socket connection string contains placeholders for remote host and port.",
  "sinks": "The decoded base64 command executes a shell command that creates a reverse shell connection to a specified remote host and port, allowing remote code execution.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom install class runs, which encodes a reverse shell payload, decodes it, and executes it via os.system, establishing a network connection to the attacker's server.",
  "anomalies": "The class name and method names are obfuscated and nonsensical. The payload creates a reverse shell, which is suspicious behavior. The base64-encoded command is executed directly, which is often used to hide malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup for a Python package but includes a malicious custom install command class. This class, when invoked during installation, constructs a reverse shell payload targeting a specific host and port, encoded in base64 for obfuscation. The payload uses Python socket and pty modules to establish a connection to the attacker's server and spawn a bash shell, potentially allowing remote control of the host. The use of obfuscated class and method names, along with the execution of a base64-decoded string via os.system, strongly indicates malicious intent. The payload's structure suggests it is designed for remote code execution and persistence.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains embedded malicious behavior intended to establish a reverse shell connection to an external server during package installation. This indicates a supply chain attack vector with high malicious potential. The obfuscation and the payload's nature confirm the presence of malware, specifically a remote access backdoor.",
