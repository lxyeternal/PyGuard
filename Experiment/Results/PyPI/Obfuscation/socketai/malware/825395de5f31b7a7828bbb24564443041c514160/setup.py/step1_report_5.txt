  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, with an overridden install command that executes potentially malicious code.",
  "sources": "The base64-encoded command executed via os.system, and the string defining the reverse shell connection.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executing base64-decoded shell commands, and the socket connection to a remote host.",
  "flows": "During installation, the code encodes a reverse shell command, then decodes and executes it, establishing a remote connection.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names; encoded malicious command; code that performs a reverse shell connection during installation; base64 encoding used to conceal intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, upon installation, encodes a reverse shell command targeting a specific host and port. It then decodes and executes this command, which creates a reverse shell to the attacker's server. The class name and method names are intentionally obfuscated. This behavior indicates an embedded backdoor or malware that activates during package installation, establishing unauthorized remote access. The use of base64 encoding suggests an attempt to evade simple static detection. No legitimate setup activities justify this behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior, specifically a hidden reverse shell payload activated during package installation, indicating high risk. The package should be considered malicious, and use should be avoided.",
