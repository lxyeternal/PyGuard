  "purpose": "A simple print statement outputting 'You are pwned'.",
  "sources": "No input, data reading, or external dependencies; static code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks; purely static output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code executes a single print statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a basic print statement with no inputs, dependencies, or malicious patterns. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature. No anomalies or malicious intent are present, and the message 'You are pwned' is provocative but not malicious. The code poses no security threat and does not contain any vulnerabilities or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No modifications or concerns are necessary.",
