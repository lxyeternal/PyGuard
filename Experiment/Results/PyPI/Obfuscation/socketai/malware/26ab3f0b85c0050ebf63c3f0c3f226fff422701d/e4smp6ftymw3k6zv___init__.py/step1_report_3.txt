  "anomalies": "The message 'You are pwned' is potentially malicious or provocative, but the code itself is straightforward and simple.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a print statement displaying 'You are pwned'. It does not read any input, connect to external systems, or perform any suspicious actions. The message could be intended as a joke or warning, but from a security perspective, it does not contain malicious code or behavior. No hidden or obfuscated code present. The simplicity indicates no malicious intent or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign in functionality, merely printing a message. There is no evidence of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks within this snippet.",
