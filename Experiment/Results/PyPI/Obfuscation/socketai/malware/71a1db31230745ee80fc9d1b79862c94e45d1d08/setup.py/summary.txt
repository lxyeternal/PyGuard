  "conclusion": "The code exhibits behaviors typical of malicious payload delivery, including obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during setup. The high obfuscation, stealth, and conditional trigger point to a high likelihood of malicious activity. Scores of malware (~0.85), obfuscation (~0.9), and security risk (~0.9) are justified based on these indicators. It should be treated as highly suspicious and further analyzed by decoding the PowerShell payload to confirm malicious intent."
