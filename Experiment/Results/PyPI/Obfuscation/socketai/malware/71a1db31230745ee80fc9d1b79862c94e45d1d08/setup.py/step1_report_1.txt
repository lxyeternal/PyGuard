  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package with embedded malicious behavior that executes a hidden PowerShell command.",
  "sources": "The subprocess.Popen call with encoded PowerShell command, os.path.exists check for 'tahg' directory",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen command that executes external code via PowerShell",
  "flows": "Check for 'tahg' directory existence -> if not present, execute encoded PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen",
  "anomalies": "Use of encoded PowerShell command with hidden window, attempt to execute potentially malicious script without clear purpose, no obvious legitimate reason for this behavior",
  "analysis": "The code begins with a setup import and then attempts to run a subprocess that executes a PowerShell command encoded in base64. The command is hidden from the user interface (WindowStyle Hidden) and runs silently. The existence check for 'tahg' directory prevents repeated execution. The PowerShell command appears to be encoded, and decoding it reveals a potentially malicious payload designed to run arbitrary commands. The setup call is standard but wrapped in a try-except that suppresses errors, which could hide issues. Overall, the code attempts to run concealed external code without user awareness, which is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains malicious behavior by executing an obfuscated PowerShell command silently, likely intended for malicious activity such as persistence or code execution. The setup configuration appears normal but is overshadowed by the malicious subprocess call.",
