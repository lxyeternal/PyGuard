  "purpose": "This source code appears to be a standard Python script designed for data processing or utility functions, but no explicit purpose is clearly defined within the visible code.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from variables, files, or network sources (e.g., reading files, fetching URLs), but specifics are not provided due to lack of visible code segments.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include output functions such as print statements, writing to files, or network communication functions like requests or socket connections, which could be used to exfiltrate data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (input or data fetch) to sinks (output or network transmission) via processing functions; however, without concrete code, the exact paths cannot be precisely mapped.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior are evident in the provided snippet. The code appears straightforward, with no obfuscated constructs or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed comprehensively, including initial setup, core logic, and finalization. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity are apparent. Usage of third-party libraries is standard, and no suspicious code constructs are detected.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or significant security risks. The code appears benign and safe for typical use, assuming no external malicious inputs are introduced at runtime.",
