{
  "purpose": "The script downloads an executable file from a specified URL and then executes it locally.",
  "sources": "Reading the system username via os.getlogin(), and fetching data from a remote URL using requests.get().",
  "sinks": "Writing downloaded content to a file and executing the file using os.startfile().",
  "flows": "Input from URL -> save to local path -> execute local file.",
  "anomalies": "The code downloads an executable from an external IP address and runs it directly, which is suspicious behavior. The URL and file path are hardcoded, and the script does not verify the downloaded content. The filename suggests a tool named 'Netflix_Checker.exe,' which may imply malicious intent such as credential theft or unauthorized access.",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves the current user's username, then downloads an executable from a remote server at IP 194.163.191.205, and executes it without any validation or user consent. The use of os.startfile to launch the downloaded file indicates that the script is intended to run potentially malicious code. The lack of checksums or validation raises the risk of executing malicious payloads. The hardcoded IP address and executable filename are typical indicators of malware or malicious activities, such as remote command execution or backdoor installation.",
  "conclusion": "The script is designed to download and execute a remote executable without validation, which poses a significant security threat. The behavior strongly suggests malicious intent, likely used for malicious payload delivery or system compromise.",
