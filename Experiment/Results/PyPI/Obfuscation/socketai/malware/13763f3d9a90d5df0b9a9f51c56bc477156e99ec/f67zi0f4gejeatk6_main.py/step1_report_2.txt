{
  "purpose": "The code downloads and executes an executable file from a specified URL, likely intended for automated retrieval and execution of a remote binary.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current username via os.getlogin(), and retrieves data from the URL 'http://194.163.191.205:6963/builds/Netflix_Checker.exe' using requests.get.",
  "sinks": "The downloaded content is written directly to a file in the user's Documents folder, and then executed with os.startfile().",
  "flows": "Input from os.getlogin() and requests.get() flows into file creation and execution: username -> URL download -> save to disk -> execute.",
  "anomalies": "The code downloads an executable from a hardcoded IP address and runs it without any validation or user consent. There are minor typos (e.g., 'reponse', 'fichier') but they do not affect functionality. The pattern suggests potential malicious intent, as it automates download and execution of external binaries.",
  "analysis": "The script retrieves the current username to determine the save path, then downloads an executable from a remote server via a hardcoded URL. It saves the executable in the user's Documents directory and immediately executes it without any verification, such as hash checking or user confirmation. The direct download and execution of remote binaries is a common tactic in malware operations. The code has no obfuscation or complex logic, but its behavior indicates malicious intent due to its nature of silently fetching and executing code from an untrusted source.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be malicious, as it downloads and executes an external executable without validation, potentially performing unauthorized actions on the host system. The hardcoded URL and immediate execution strongly suggest malicious intent.",
