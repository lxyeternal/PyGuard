{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that includes a malicious backdoor payload in a custom install command.",
  "sources": "The socket connection to an external IP address and the spawn of a shell process via pty.spawn.",
  "sinks": "Socket connection to remote server, spawning a shell with pty.spawn, duplicating socket file descriptor to standard input/output/error.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom install command connects to an external IP, redirects shell input/output to the socket, and spawns a shell, creating a backdoor.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual class and method names, hardcoded IP address and port, direct spawning of a shell with network redirection during package install, obfuscated class/method naming pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code extends the standard setup.py install process with a malicious payload. It establishes a network connection to a remote server (104.248.19.57:3333), then redirects the shell's input, output, and error streams to this socket, and spawns a shell. This creates a remote backdoor accessible to the attacker. The class and method names are intentionally obfuscated. The malicious behavior is triggered during package installation, indicating an intentional compromise to establish remote access.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains a malicious backdoor that, upon installation, connects to an external server and opens a remote shell, representing a high security risk. It is highly suspicious and should not be used.",
