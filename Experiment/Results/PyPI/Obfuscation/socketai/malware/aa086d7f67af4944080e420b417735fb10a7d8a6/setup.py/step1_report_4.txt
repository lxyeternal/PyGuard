{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, but it contains malicious code intended to establish a reverse shell connection to an external server.",
  "sources": "Socket connection to external IP (104.248.19.57:3333) during installation process",
  "sinks": "Duplication of socket file descriptor to standard input/output/error and spawning a shell ('/bin/sh')",
  "flows": "Upon installation, the code creates a socket connection to an external server, duplicates the socket to standard IO, and spawns a shell, enabling remote control",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names, unusual network connection during package installation, direct spawn of a shell without user consent",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup-related modules and network modules, then defines a class inheriting from 'install' that overrides the 'run' method (named KXTEFolzuwhaelPbCkkpUwbaYKBCzdKs). Inside this method, it establishes a socket connection to a remote IP address and port, redirects this socket to standard input/output/error, and spawns a shell. This behavior is characteristic of a reverse shell, a common malicious tactic. The package's setup parameters are typical, but the custom install class introduces malicious behavior during installation. The obfuscated class and method names further suggest malicious intent. There are no benign reasons for such behavior in a legitimate setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains clear malicious behavior: establishing a reverse shell connection during package installation. The obfuscated naming, external IP connection, and spawning of a shell strongly indicate malicious intent, likely intended for remote code execution and control.",
