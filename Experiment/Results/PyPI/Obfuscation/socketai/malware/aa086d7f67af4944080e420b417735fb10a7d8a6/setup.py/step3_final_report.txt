  "purpose": "Detect and evaluate malicious behavior in Python package setup code, specifically reverse shells and backdoors during installation.",
  "sources": "Code reads input/output streams, establishes socket connection, and spawns a shell during setup.",
  "sinks": "Socket connection to external IP, redirection of stdin/stdout/stderr, spawning of shell.",
  "flows": "Code initiates socket connection -> redirects system IO -> spawns shell during install process.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names, hardcoded IP and port, malicious activity during package installation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, during installation, connects to an external IP, redirects system IO to this socket, and spawns a shell, constituting a reverse shell backdoor. The obfuscation of class/method names and execution during setup are suspicious. All reports correctly identify these behaviors as malicious, assigning maximum malware and security risk scores, with high obfuscation scores (~0.8-0.9). The behavior is clearly malicious, justifying malware score of 1 and risk score of 1. The obfuscation is moderate but consistent with malicious intent. The code's actions pose a severe security threat, enabling remote control of the host system. The scores are consistent and justified based on the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly malicious backdoor that establishes a reverse shell during package installation. The obfuscation and hardcoded IP further indicate malicious intent. All reports' assessments and scores are accurate and justified. Immediate removal or flagging of this package is recommended.",
