{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package, with an overridden install command that attempts to establish a network connection and spawn a shell.",
  "sources": "The socket connection to IP 104.248.19.57 on port 3333, which is used to connect to an external server.",
  "sinks": "The os.dup2 calls redirecting socket file descriptor to stdin, stdout, and stderr, followed by spawning a shell via pty.spawn('/bin/sh'), which can allow remote command execution.",
  "flows": "During installation, the code initiates a socket connection to an external server, then redirects the system's standard input/output/error to that socket, and finally spawns a shell, enabling remote access.",
  "anomalies": "The install method is hijacked to include network communication and shell spawning, which is unusual and suspicious behavior in a package installation process.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, then defines a custom install class that overrides the default install method. In this method, it establishes a socket connection to a specific IP address and port. It then redirects the process's standard streams to this socket, and spawns a shell session. This sequence resembles a backdoor, allowing remote control of the machine during package installation. The setup configuration includes this malicious class in cmdclass, meaning any installation of this package will execute this backdoor code. The overall behavior indicates intent to facilitate unauthorized remote access, which is malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains clear malicious behavior: establishing a network connection to a remote server, redirecting system I/O, and spawning a shell during package installation. This is indicative of a backdoor designed for remote command execution. The package should be considered highly dangerous and should not be used.",
