{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The socket connection and spawn call within the custom install class, socket module, and os module functions.",
  "sinks": "Socket connection to external IP and spawning a shell, potentially allowing remote command execution.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom install class initiates a socket connection to an external IP address, duplicates socket file descriptors to stdin, stdout, stderr, and then spawns a shell, which could give remote access.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual class name, obfuscated method name, hardcoded IP address and port, and the spawning of a shell during installation process. No typical setup tasks are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the install command to create a socket connection to an external server (104.248.19.57:3333). Once connected, it redirects stdin, stdout, and stderr to this socket and spawns a shell (/bin/sh), effectively creating a remote backdoor. The presence of hardcoded IP and port, along with the immediate shell spawn during package installation, is highly suspicious and indicative of malicious intent. The rest of the setup code appears normal, but these malicious activities dominate the code's purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly malicious, implementing a remote backdoor that connects to an external server during package installation, allowing remote command execution. It appears designed to compromise systems where the package is installed.",
