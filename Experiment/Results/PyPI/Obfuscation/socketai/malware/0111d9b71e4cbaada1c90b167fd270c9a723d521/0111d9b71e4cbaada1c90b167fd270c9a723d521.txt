      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious intent, employing encrypted payloads and dynamic execution during setup, which poses a serious security threat. The obfuscation and conditional behavior further support malicious activity. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0.9, obfuscated 0.85, security risk 0.9) are justified and consistent with the analysis."
