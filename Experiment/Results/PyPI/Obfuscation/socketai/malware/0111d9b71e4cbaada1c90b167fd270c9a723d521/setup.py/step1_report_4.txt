  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that includes a custom install command which performs additional actions on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables and system commands during installation.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decrypted code via exec() potentially executing malicious payload; import of external libraries requests and fernet.",
  "flows": "During installation on Windows, the custom install command decrypts code and executes it via exec(), which is a direct source-to-sink path.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of seemingly random, obfuscated strings; decrypted code executed dynamically with exec(); the use of Fernet for decrypting code at runtime; conditional code execution only on Windows OS.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a package with a custom install command that, on Windows, imports requests and Fernet, then decrypts and executes a code block. The code string being decrypted is hardcoded, but obfuscated. This behavior indicates an intentional dynamic code execution, which is suspicious. The decryption key and cipher text are embedded within the code, making this potentially malicious or backdoored behavior. No other suspicious behaviors such as network connections or data exfiltration are explicitly present, but executing decrypted code at install time is a high security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code employs obfuscated, dynamically decrypted code that is executed during installation on Windows systems, which is a significant security risk. This behavior could facilitate malicious actions such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The presence of hardcoded encrypted payload and conditional execution strongly suggests malicious intent.",
