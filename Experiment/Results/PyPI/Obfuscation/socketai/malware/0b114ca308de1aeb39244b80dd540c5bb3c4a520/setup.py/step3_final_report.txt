{
  "purpose": "The code downloads and executes a remote executable during package installation, using environment variables and network requests, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', requests to 'linkedopports.com' and 'python-release.com', file download and execution via os.system.",
  "sinks": "Execution of downloaded executable via os.system, potential system compromise, remote code execution.",
  "flows": "Reads environment variable -> makes network requests -> downloads executable -> executes via os.system.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable and function names, silent exception handling with 'except: pass', downloading and executing external code during setup.",
  "analysis": "The code performs network requests to suspicious URLs, retrieves environment info, and downloads and runs an executable during installation, which is indicative of malware. Obfuscated naming and silent error handling mask malicious activity. The behavior aligns with supply chain attacks and backdoors. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=1, securityRisk=1, obfuscated≈0.8, confidence≈0.9) are justified given the evidence. The code's actions pose a high security threat, warranting maximum risk and malware scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, executing external payloads during package installation, representing a severe security risk. The high obfuscation and silent failure handling further support malicious intent. It should be flagged as malware and removed from distribution channels.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "obfuscated": 0.8,
  "malware": 1,
  "securityRisk": 1,
