{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package with added malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', requests.get calls to external URLs, and a custom install class executing code during installation.",
  "sinks": "Downloading and executing an executable file ('ini_file_pyp_32.exe') via os.system, which can run arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' -> external URL request (resp.php) -> download of 'ini_file_pyp_32.exe' -> execution via os.system",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function and class names, use of try-except without handling, dynamic code execution via os.system, downloading and executing external files during install, and hardcoded URLs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup tools and defines a function 'jiiiilNDyrJLLcwSjbkwiZBPhXSbyQSW' that retrieves the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable and sends it to an external URL. It then, if on Windows, downloads an executable from a suspicious URL and runs it silently. The custom 'install' class overrides the install method to invoke this function during package installation, effectively executing arbitrary code from an external source. The package metadata is minimal but includes the malicious hook embedded in the installation process.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains clear malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external payload during package installation, which can compromise the host system. The obfuscated function and the use of dynamic code execution strongly suggest malicious intent.",
