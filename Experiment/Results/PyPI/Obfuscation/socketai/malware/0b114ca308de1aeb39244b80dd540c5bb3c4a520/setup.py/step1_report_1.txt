{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a setup script for a Python package that includes custom installation behavior involving network requests and file operations.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', URL 'https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php', URL 'https://python-release.com/python-install.scr', and external requests to download files.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URLs, writing and executing a downloaded file, launching an executable via os.system.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' is used to generate a URL request; then, depending on the platform, a remote file is downloaded and executed with 'os.system'.",
  "anomalies": "The code downloads and executes a file from a suspicious URL, uses environment variables to personalize requests, and runs external executables without validation or user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup and install modules, then defines a function that retrieves the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable and makes an HTTP GET request to a potentially malicious URL. If on Windows, it downloads a file from a suspicious domain and executes it immediately, which could be harmful. The custom install class extends the standard 'install' command to run this function during package installation. The setup call defines package metadata but includes no verification or security checks. Overall, the behavior of downloading and executing remote files during installation poses a significant security risk.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains malicious behavior by downloading and executing external files during package installation. The use of external URLs, environment variables, and immediate execution indicates potential malware or backdoor functionality. The package should be considered highly suspicious and unsafe to use.",
