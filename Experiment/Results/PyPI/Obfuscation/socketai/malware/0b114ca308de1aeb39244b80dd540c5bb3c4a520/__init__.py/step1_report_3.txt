{
  "purpose": "The function prints a message indicating an installation or acknowledgment.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources are present.",
  "sinks": "Output to standard output via print(), which is generally safe.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The function name appears obfuscated (non-meaningful), which may be suspicious, but no malicious activity is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function with an obfuscated name that simply prints a static message 'installed'. It then calls this function. There are no external data sources, no input handling, no network activity, or other suspicious behavior. The obfuscated name could be a tactic to hide intent, but the code's actions are benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a trivial, benign print operation with an obfuscated function name. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
