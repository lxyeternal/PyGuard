  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is trivial, performing a simple print of \"installed\".\n- The function name is obfuscated or non-descriptive in all cases.\n- No external input, network activity, file operations, or other suspicious behaviors are present.\n- The code is consistent across reports: a single function with an obfuscated name that prints a static message, then invoked immediately.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code matches the descriptions: no issues with code presence or logic.\n- No signs of malicious activity or malicious code snippets.\n- The obfuscation appears superficial, possibly just to hide the function name.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n- The reports are consistent and thorough; no significant errors detected.\n- They correctly identify the benign nature of the code and the obfuscation aspect.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- *Malware score:* consistently 0, which aligns with the benign analysis.\n- *Obfuscated score:* ranges from 0.4 to 0.8; given the obfuscated function name, a score around 0.6 seems appropriate.\n- *Security risk:* very low (0 or 0.1), matching the benign nature.\n\n**Score justifications:**\n- Since no malicious activity is present, malware scores should remain at 0.\n- Obfuscation alone, especially with a non-descriptive function name, warrants a moderate score (~0.6).\n- Risk scores should stay low, around 0.1, given the trivial and benign behavior.\n\n**Potential issues:**\n- The reports sometimes assign a slightly higher obfuscation score (up to 0.8). While obfuscation can be suspicious, in this context, it's not necessarily malicious. A score of about 0.6 is more balanced.\n- The reports do not consider that obfuscation alone isn't malicious; it should be weighted accordingly.\n\n**Summary of my assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** approximately 0.6 (more balanced considering the superficial obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (appropriate for such trivial code)\n\n**Final notes:**\n- The code is benign, and the obfuscation appears superficial.\n- No evidence supports higher malware or risk scores.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; minor adjustment to obfuscation score is recommended.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, I agree with the overall benign assessment but suggest slightly lowering the obfuscation score to around 0.6 for a more accurate reflection. The malware and risk scores are appropriate as is.",
