  "purpose": "The function prints a message indicating installation or presence.",
  "sources": "No external input or data read; no input sources present.",
  "sinks": "Output to standard output (print statement).",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the function simply prints a static message.",
  "anomalies": "The function name appears obfuscated or randomly generated, but this alone is not suspicious without further malicious code. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function with a non-descriptive, obfuscated name. It only outputs a static string 'installed' when invoked. There are no external data inputs, no network activity, no file operations, or other suspicious behaviors. The function is called immediately after definition, which makes it benign in isolation. No signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, performing a simple print operation with an obfuscated function name. No malicious or security risks detected.",
