{
  "purpose": "A simple function that prints 'installed' when called.",
  "sources": "The function is defined and invoked within the same script; no external input or data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs to standard output; no untrusted data or external sinks involved.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code simply executes a print statement.",
  "anomalies": "The function name appears obfuscated, but the code itself is straightforward and does not perform any suspicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function with an obfuscated name that prints a static message. It then calls this function. There are no external data inputs, network connections, or system modifications. The obfuscated name could be an attempt to hide intent, but the internal code is benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be benign, performing a simple print operation with an obfuscated function name. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
