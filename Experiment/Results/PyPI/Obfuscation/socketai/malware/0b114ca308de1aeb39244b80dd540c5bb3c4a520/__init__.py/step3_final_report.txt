{
  "purpose": "A trivial function that prints 'installed' and is invoked immediately, likely serving as a placeholder or benign indicator.",
  "sources": "No external inputs, environment variables, or data sources; only internal function call.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows leading to data leaks, system modifications, or network activity.",
  "flows": "Function definition (source) directly leads to its invocation (sink), with no external data or untrusted input involved.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function name without descriptive meaning; code is minimal and static, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single, obfuscated-named function that prints a static message 'installed' and is called immediately. No external data, network activity, or malicious payloads are present. The obfuscation is superficial and does not indicate malicious intent. Malware score is 0, security risk is very low (~0.1), and obfuscation score is moderate (~0.6) due to the non-descriptive function name. The code is benign, with no signs of sabotage or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, trivial, and harmless. The obfuscation is superficial and does not elevate risk. Scores are consistent with the benign nature, with a slight adjustment to obfuscation score to reflect the non-descriptive function name. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
