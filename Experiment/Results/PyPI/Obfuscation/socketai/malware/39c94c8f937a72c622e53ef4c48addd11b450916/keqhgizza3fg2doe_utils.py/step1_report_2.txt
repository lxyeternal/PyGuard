  "purpose": "The purpose of this code is not explicitly stated; it appears to be designed for data processing or manipulation, but lacks clear documentation.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from user prompts, environment variables, and possibly external files or network requests (if present).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include writing to files, making network requests, executing system commands, or printing sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions to output or sink functions, with no evident sanitization or validation.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behaviors include hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated segments. No such anomalies are evident in the provided code snippet.",
  "analysis": "Step 1: Review the imports and initialization to identify data sources. Step 2: Examine any input handling for validation or sanitization. Step 3: Trace the data flow from sources to sinks. Step 4: Check for hardcoded secrets, malicious functions, or obfuscated code. Step 5: Evaluate the use of third-party libraries. No suspicious or malicious patterns are detected. The code appears straightforward, with no signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious activities. Security risks are minimal, assuming benign context.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit any clear malicious behavior or supply chain security threats. It appears to be a typical, benign script with no signs of malware or security vulnerabilities based on the provided content.",
