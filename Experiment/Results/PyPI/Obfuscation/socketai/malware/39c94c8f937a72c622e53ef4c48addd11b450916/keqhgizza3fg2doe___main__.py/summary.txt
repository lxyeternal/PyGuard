  "conclusion": "The analyzed reports are consistent in their scoring and reasoning. Report 1's moderate suspicion is justified given the signs of obfuscation and dynamic code execution, though lacking concrete code evidence. Other reports correctly identify benign code. No adjustments are necessary; current scores accurately reflect the assessed security posture."
