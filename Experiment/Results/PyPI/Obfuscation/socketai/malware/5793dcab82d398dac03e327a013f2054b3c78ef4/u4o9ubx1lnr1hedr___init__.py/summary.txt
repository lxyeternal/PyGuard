  "conclusion": "The import statement alone does not indicate malicious activity. The suspicious module name warrants further investigation if the package source is available. Current scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0.2, and risk=0.2 are appropriate given the limited evidence. No immediate threat is identified, but caution is advised pending further analysis of the 'stillrequestsa' package."
