  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, user input, network data, executes system commands, eval()/exec() on untrusted data.",
  "sinks": "System commands, network connections, potential data exfiltration points, code execution points.",
  "flows": "Untrusted data sources (environment/user input) flow into eval()/exec() or system commands, possibly leading to malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval()/exec() on untrusted data, obfuscation indicators, hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code shows high risk behaviors such as dynamic code execution on untrusted data, potential obfuscation, and suspicious network activity, justifying elevated malware and security risk scores. Benign reports lack suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, and low risk scores. The scores are consistent with the described behaviors, with report 2 indicating significant malicious potential, and others indicating benign or low-risk code.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency contains high-risk code in report 2, with behaviors indicative of malicious intent, including eval()/exec() on untrusted data and obfuscation. Other reports are benign. The scores are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
