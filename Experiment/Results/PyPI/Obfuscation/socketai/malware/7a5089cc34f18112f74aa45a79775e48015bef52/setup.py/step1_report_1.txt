  "flows": "Input arguments (sys.argv[1]) and environment variables -> conditional execution branches and commands -> system modifications, file operations, registry access, system command executions, shortcut creation, environment variable retrieval",
  "anomalies": "Complex, intentionally obfuscated logic with heavily encoded strings and dynamic module imports; dynamic code execution via os.system, pip.main, os.popen, win32com, ctypes; conditional system privilege checks with IsUserAnAdmin; extensive use of complex bitwise and arithmetic operations to obscure intent; presence of functions that could modify files, create shortcuts, or execute system commands without clear purpose.",
  "analysis": "The script is heavily obfuscated using character code transformations and complex arithmetic to hide its true purpose. It performs platform-dependent checks and manipulates sys.argv inputs to trigger different code paths. Several branches involve importing system and Windows-specific modules (win32com, ctypes), with some branches calling system modification functions such as os.remove, os.makedirs, os.path.exists, os.path.expanduser, and executing code via os.system or pip.main. The code also checks for admin privileges with IsUserAnAdmin, and in some branches, creates shortcuts or executes file operations. The widespread use of encoded strings and dynamic code generation indicates an attempt to conceal malicious behavior. The presence of environment variable retrieval and system privilege checks suggests potential for privilege escalation or privilege-sensitive actions. Overall, the code seems designed to perform malicious system modifications, file operations, or privilege escalation depending on input arguments and environment state. The code's structure and obfuscation strongly indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code exhibits high obfuscation and employs multiple techniques to hide its true behavior, including complex string encoding, dynamic imports, and conditional execution of system commands and file operations. It interacts with system-specific modules, modifies files, creates shortcuts, and potentially executes malicious commands. These behaviors are characteristic of malicious payloads or backdoors hidden behind obfuscation. Therefore, this package should be considered highly malicious and dangerous to system security.",
