  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious intent due to the use of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during package setup. The behavior aligns with tactics used in malware delivery or backdoor persistence. Scores are appropriately high; further decoding of the PowerShell command is recommended for confirmation. Treat this package as highly suspicious or malicious until further analysis is performed."
