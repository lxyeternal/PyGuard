  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks, possibly through variables or functions, but specifics cannot be identified without the code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies can be detected without the code. Common anomalies include hardcoded credentials, unusual dynamic code execution, or obfuscated segments.",
  "analysis": "Insufficient information to analyze the code step-by-step. The provided input lacks actual code content, making detailed analysis impossible. Based on standard review procedures, key areas such as data input sources, output sinks, and flow paths cannot be identified or evaluated.",
  "conclusion": "Due to the absence of the code snippet, no definitive malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation can be confirmed. The review cannot be completed accurately without actual code content.",
