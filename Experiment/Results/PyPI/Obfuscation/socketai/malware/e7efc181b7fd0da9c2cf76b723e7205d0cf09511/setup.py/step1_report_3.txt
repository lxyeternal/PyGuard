  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package with custom installation behavior.",
  "sources": "Reads the embedded obfuscated string 'wopvEaTEcopFEavc', which appears to contain encoded data, and the long description file 'README.md'.",
  "sinks": "Uses eval() on dynamically decoded code, which could execute malicious code if the embedded string is malicious.",
  "flows": "The obfuscated string is decoded via XOR with a long numeric key, then compiled and evaluated with eval().",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated, encoded string that is decoded at runtime and executed dynamically via eval(), which is a common indicator of malicious or obfuscated code. The decoding process and the eval() call are suspicious, especially in a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup functions and defines a custom install command. Within the run() method of this custom command, it defines an obfuscated string 'wopvEaTEcopFEavc' containing non-printable characters, and a large numeric string 'iOpvEoeaaeavocp'. It decodes the obfuscated string by XORing each character's ASCII value with a character from the numeric string, wrapping around as needed. After decoding, it uses eval() on the result. This pattern strongly suggests the presence of hidden malicious code that is concealed and then executed dynamically during package installation. The code is intentionally obfuscated, making it difficult to understand the actual payload. The use of try-except with a pass block suppresses errors, further hiding any malicious activity. The rest of the setup code appears normal and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated payload decoded and executed dynamically via eval(), which is highly suspicious. The obfuscation and runtime evaluation strongly indicate malicious intent or malicious payload hidden within the package. Due to these factors, the package poses a significant security risk, likely intended to run malicious code during installation.",
