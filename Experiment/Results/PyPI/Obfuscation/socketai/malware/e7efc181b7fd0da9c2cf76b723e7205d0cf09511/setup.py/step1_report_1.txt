{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package, with a custom install command that executes obfuscated code during installation.",
  "sources": "The obfuscated string 'wopvEaTEcopFEavc' and the numeric string 'iOpvEoeaaeavocp' are read directly within the custom install class.",
  "sinks": "The obfuscated code is compiled and evaluated using eval(compile()), which can execute malicious code dynamically.",
  "flows": "The obfuscated string is decoded via XOR with a key derived from a numeric string, then executed using eval(compile()), representing a source-to-sink flow of decoded code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of heavily obfuscated, dynamically decoded code that is executed at install time, which is unusual and suspicious. The decoding process hints at hiding malicious intent. The obfuscation and dynamic execution are common tactics to evade detection.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup and install from setuptools, and defines a custom InstallCommand class that overrides run(). Within run(), it defines a large obfuscated string (wopvEaTEcopFEavc) and a numeric key string (iOpvEoeaaeavocp). It performs XOR decoding of the obfuscated string, then attempts to execute the decoded code via eval(compile()). The decoding process and eval invocation suggest that malicious code is hidden in the obfuscated string, which is decoded and executed during installation. The use of obscure variable names, obfuscation, and dynamic code execution strongly indicates malicious intent or malicious sabotage. The setup configuration at the end registers this custom command, meaning the malicious code runs during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a heavily obfuscated payload that is decoded and executed at installation time, which is a high security risk. This pattern is typical of malicious backdoors or malware embedded in Python packages. The obfuscation and dynamic execution are clear signs of malicious behavior, likely intended to hide malicious code from casual inspection.",
