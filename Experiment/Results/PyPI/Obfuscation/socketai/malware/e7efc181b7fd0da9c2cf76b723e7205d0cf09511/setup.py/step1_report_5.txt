{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package with a custom install command that executes obfuscated code during installation.",
  "sources": "The obfuscated string assigned to wopvEaTEcopFEavc, and the lengthy numeric string assigned to iOpvEoeaaeavocp; both are used as data sources for execution.",
  "sinks": "The eval(compile()) function, which executes dynamically generated code from the de-obfuscated string, is a critical sink where untrusted or malicious code could run.",
  "flows": "The code de-obfuscates the string in wopvEaTEcopFEavc via XOR with a numeric key, then compiles and executes it, directly leading to the sink. The source data is manipulated to produce executable code.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of heavily obfuscated string, dynamic code execution using eval(compile()), no comments explaining the purpose, and a hardcoded large numeric string for XOR de-obfuscation are highly suspicious. The use of obfuscation and eval is unusual in legitimate setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script loads an obfuscated string containing non-readable data, then uses a lengthy numeric string as a key to XOR-deobfuscate the data. The result is compiled and executed at runtime, which is a common technique for hiding malicious payloads. The code is embedded in a custom installation command, making it potentially run malicious code during package installation. This pattern suggests intent to conceal malicious behavior, such as executing arbitrary code on the target system without explicit user awareness. The code does not contain any benign or functional logic apart from package setup, and the obfuscation combined with dynamic execution strongly indicates malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, dynamically executed code during package installation, indicating a high likelihood of malicious behavior. This pattern is typical of malicious supply chain attacks aiming to run arbitrary code upon package installation. It is highly recommended to treat this package as malicious and avoid usage.",
