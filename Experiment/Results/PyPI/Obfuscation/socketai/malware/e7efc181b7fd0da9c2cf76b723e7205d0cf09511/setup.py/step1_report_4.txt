{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up a Python package using setuptools, with a custom installation step.",
  "sources": "The code reads a large obfuscated string stored in the variable 'wopvEaTEcopFEavc' and a numeric string 'iOpvEoeaaeavocp', then processes these to generate executable code.",
  "sinks": "The generated code from the obfuscated string is compiled and executed via eval(compile(...)), which can execute arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "The code decodes the obfuscated string through XOR with a repeated numeric string, then compiles and executes it, making the flow from obfuscated data source to execution sink.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of heavily obfuscated string data, dynamic code generation and execution via eval and compile, which are common indicators of malicious payload delivery. No legitimate setup code typically involves such obfuscation and runtime code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a setup configuration for a Python package but includes a try-except block within a custom install command. Inside the try block, it contains an obfuscated string and a large numeric string. It processes these strings by XOR-ing each character of the obfuscated string with a character from the numeric string, cycling through it. The resulting string is then compiled and executed with eval(compile(...)). This pattern is characteristic of malware or malicious code, as it attempts to hide its true intent. The use of obfuscated data, dynamic execution, and lack of legitimate setup logic suggest this is malicious payload intended to run hidden or malicious code during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated and dynamically executed code, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. It likely executes hidden malicious payloads during package installation, posing a security risk. This package should be considered unsafe for use.",
