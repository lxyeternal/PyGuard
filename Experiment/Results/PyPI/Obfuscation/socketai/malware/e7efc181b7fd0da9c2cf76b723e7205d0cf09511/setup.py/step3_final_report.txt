{
  "purpose": "Detect and analyze obfuscated malicious code embedded in the setup script that executes during package installation.",
  "sources": "Obfuscated string 'wopvEaTEcopFEavc' and the large numeric string 'iOpvEoeaaeavocp' used for XOR decryption.",
  "sinks": "The eval(compile()) call on the decoded code, which executes arbitrary code at install time.",
  "flows": "XOR decryption of the obfuscated string using the numeric key, then passing the decoded code to eval(compile()) for execution.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with nonsensical variable names, suppression of errors via try-except-pass, and runtime execution of dynamically decoded code.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a heavily obfuscated payload decoded through XOR with a large numeric string. The decoded string is then executed via eval(compile()), a pattern commonly associated with malicious backdoors or payloads. The suppression of errors and absence of legitimate setup logic further indicate malicious intent. The obfuscation and dynamic execution pose a significant security risk, enabling arbitrary code execution during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, employing obfuscation and dynamic code execution to hide harmful payloads. It represents a serious supply chain security threat and should be classified with maximum malware and risk scores.",
