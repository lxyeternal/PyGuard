{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script that, upon import, collects system information and exfiltrates it to an external server, then executes an external version file without validation, indicating malicious or privacy-invasive behavior.",
  "sources": "The 'detect()' function reads system info and sends it via HTTP POST; the 'exec(open('kafka/version.py').read())' executes external code.",
  "sinks": "Network request to 'http://us.dslab.pw/webhook.php' transmitting system info; execution of external 'kafka/version.py' code.",
  "flows": "Source: 'detect()' gathers system info -> sink: HTTP POST request; Source: 'exec()' reads and executes external file -> sink: code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional execution of data exfiltration on import; execution of external code without validation; package name appears obfuscated; no user consent for data transfer.",
  "analysis": "The code immediately transmits system info to an external URL and executes an external script without validation, which are classic indicators of malicious activity. The network request and external code execution occur without user awareness, representing significant privacy and security risks. The package name is non-descriptive, possibly to hide malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.9, security risk ~0.9) are justified given these behaviors. No obfuscation is present. The code's actions align with known malicious patterns such as data theft and remote code execution. Overall, the code demonstrates high malicious potential and should be flagged accordingly.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits active data exfiltration and external code execution without validation, indicating malicious or highly suspicious behavior. The assigned malware and security risk scores are appropriate and justified. It should be considered malicious and avoided or further investigated.",
