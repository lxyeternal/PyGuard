  "purpose": "Utility functions and test classes for Kafka integration testing, including environment variable checks, port allocation, message encoding, and timing utilities.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'KAFKA_VERSION', socket binding for port detection, UUID and random string generation for messages, environment variables for test configuration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows leading to data leaks or system effects; standard message encoding and socket use without external network activity.",
  "flows": "Environment variable read for version validation; socket binding to allocate ephemeral ports; message generation via UUIDs and random strings; environment variables influence test flow but do not lead to external data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "None; code performs standard testing utilities with no suspicious or unusual code patterns, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, and no malicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises standard testing utilities for Kafka, including environment variable checks, socket port allocation, message encoding with UUIDs, and a timing context manager. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows are present. The environment variable 'KAFKA_VERSION' is used for configuration, which is typical. Socket binding for port detection is safe and common in test setups. Message encoding with UUIDs and random strings is benign. No external network activity beyond Kafka client interactions occurs. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code. The scores assigned by the initial reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency is safe, benign, and intended solely for Kafka testing purposes. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0.0–0.2 are accurate and justified.",
