{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions and classes for Kafka integration testing, including version validation, port allocation, message handling, and timing.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable 'KAFKA_VERSION' and process inputs to generate messages and port numbers.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly outputs untrusted data to external systems or executes untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are used to control test execution flow; no flow of untrusted external input into critical functions beyond environment variable checks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code. Usage of random, uuid, and socket libraries appears standard for test setup.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily facilitates Kafka test setup, including environment checks, port selection, message generation, and timing. No dangerous or malicious patterns are present. The environment variable 'KAFKA_VERSION' controls test flow. No untrusted data flows into insecure sinks, and no suspicious code behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate testing utility code for Kafka integration, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
