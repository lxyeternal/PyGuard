{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of test cases for Kafka consumer functionality, including connection, group management, and pause/resume features.",
  "sources": "User-provided input is minimal; most data originates from Kafka broker responses and internal function calls. No external input is directly read.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data is exploited for malicious effects. No network transmissions of sensitive data or file modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from Kafka broker responses through consumer polling and group coordination. No evidence of malicious data manipulation or injection points.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Use of standard testing libraries and Kafka client code appears benign.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly consists of test functions verifying Kafka consumer behaviors with standard libraries. It does not contain dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. No hardcoded secrets, network exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The data flows are from Kafka responses and test control logic, with no indication of malicious data manipulation or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of standard test cases for Kafka consumer functionalities, with no malicious behavior, security risks, or signs of malware. It appears safe and solely intended for testing purposes.",
