{
  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to collect system information and exfiltrate it to an external server.",
  "sources": "Socket hostname, current working directory, username, directory listings of '/', '/root/', '/home/', and '/root/.ssh/'",
  "sinks": "Requests POST to 'https://j0j0.xyz/lists/...' with system data; file creation in '/root/j0j0.poc'",
  "flows": "System info collected from socket, os, and getpass, then sent via HTTP POST request to external server",
  "anomalies": "Unusual collection of multiple directory listings, creating a file in '/root/', sending data to suspicious domain, obfuscated class and method names",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation command that, upon installation, gathers host, user, current directory, and several sensitive directory listings, then exfiltrates this information to a suspicious external URL. It also creates a file in '/root/' which may be used as a marker or backdoor indicator. The naming obfuscation and network communication with an untrusted domain are suspicious. The use of requests for data exfiltration and the gathering of potentially sensitive system info suggest malicious intent. The code does not perform any malicious system modifications but attempts covert data theft during installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting sensitive system information and exfiltrating it to an external server during package installation. The obfuscated class/method names and the nature of the data collection indicate an intent to stealthily harvest data. Therefore, this package should be considered malicious with high security risk.",
