{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up a Python package with a custom install command that collects system information and exfiltrates it to an external server.",
  "sources": "Reads hostname (`socket.gethostname()`), current working directory (`os.getcwd()`), username (`getpass.getuser()`), and directory listings from '/','/root/', '/home/', and '/root/.ssh/'.",
  "sinks": "Sends collected system information via HTTP POST request to 'https://j0j0.xyz/lists/<hostname>/<cwd>/'.",
  "flows": "System info is gathered from multiple sources and compiled into a dictionary which is then sent to the external server via requests.post.",
  "anomalies": "Code writes to '/root/j0j0.poc' unconditionally; collects potentially sensitive directory listings; exfiltrates data over HTTP; uses obfuscated class and variable names; and performs data collection in an install script, which is unusual.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom install class that inherits from setuptools' install. During installation, it gathers system info such as hostname, current directory, username, and directory contents from root, home, and SSH directories. It attempts to write to '/root/j0j0.poc' unconditionally, which may be used as a marker or for malicious purposes. It then sends all collected data to an external URL via a POST request, which is suspicious as it leaks potentially sensitive info during package installation. The code employs obfuscated class and variable names, indicating an attempt to hide malicious intent. The code runs during installation, which is a common tactic for malicious code injection in supply chain attacks.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during package installation to an external server. The data collection of sensitive directories and unprotected transmission are significant security concerns. The obfuscation and unusual behavior suggest malicious intent, possibly for reconnaissance or data theft. The script should be considered high risk, and use of this package is strongly discouraged.",
