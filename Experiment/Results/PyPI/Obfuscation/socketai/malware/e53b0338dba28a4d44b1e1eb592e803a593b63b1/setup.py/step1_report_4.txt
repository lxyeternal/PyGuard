  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to collect system information and send it to an external server.",
  "sources": "Reading system hostname, current working directory, username, directory listings, and attempting to open/create a file in /root.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST request to an external domain (https://j0j0.xyz/lists/...), sending collected system data.",
  "flows": "System info collected from hostname, cwd, username, directory listings, then sent via requests.post to external server.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual collection of system info including directory listings and file creation in /root; sending data to a suspicious domain; hardcoded URL; obfuscated class and method names; use of try-except without handling exceptions properly.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation command that, during package installation, collects sensitive system information such as hostname, current directory, username, and directory listings from /, /root, /home, and /root/.ssh. It attempts to create or open a file in /root/.poC, which may require root privileges. All gathered data is packaged into a dictionary and sent via an HTTP POST request to an external URL (https://j0j0.xyz/lists/...), which appears suspicious. The use of obfuscated class and method names, combined with data collection and external communication, suggests malicious intent or at least suspicious behavior, potentially to exfiltrate sensitive system data without user awareness.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs covert data collection and exfiltration during package installation, indicating malicious behavior. It aims to gather system details and send them to a suspicious domain, which could compromise system security or privacy.",
