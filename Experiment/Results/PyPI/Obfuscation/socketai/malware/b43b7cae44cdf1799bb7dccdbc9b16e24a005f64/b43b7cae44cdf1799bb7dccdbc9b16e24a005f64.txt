      "conclusion": "The code exhibits highly suspicious behavior consistent with malware, notably covert data exfiltration via DNS queries during package setup. The obfuscation and network activity justify a high malware and security risk score. It should be treated as malicious or at least highly suspicious pending further dynamic analysis."
