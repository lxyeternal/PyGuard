{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package but also executes a hidden PowerShell command if a specific directory does not exist.",
  "sources": "os.path.exists('tahg') check, subprocess.Popen call with encoded PowerShell command",
  "sinks": "subprocess.Popen executing hidden PowerShell command, potentially launching malicious code",
  "flows": "Check for 'tahg' directory -> If not exists, execute encoded PowerShell command",
  "anomalies": "Encoded PowerShell command executed via subprocess without user consent, no error handling or logging, the purpose of the PowerShell command is obfuscated",
  "analysis": "The script first imports setup functions and then checks if the directory 'tahg' exists. If it does not, it runs a subprocess that executes an encoded PowerShell command with hidden window style. The PowerShell command is base64 encoded, which is commonly used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The setup call is wrapped in a try-except block that silently ignores errors. The use of encoded commands, hidden window execution, and absence of explicit documentation suggest malicious intent, possibly downloading or executing malicious payloads silently. There is no visible benign purpose for this hidden PowerShell execution. The setup configuration appears standard but may be a decoy or disguise.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains suspicious behavior: it conditionally executes an encoded PowerShell command in the background without user visibility or logs. This behavior is indicative of malicious intent, potentially for executing arbitrary or harmful code. The overall structure supports an attempt to conceal malicious activity.",
