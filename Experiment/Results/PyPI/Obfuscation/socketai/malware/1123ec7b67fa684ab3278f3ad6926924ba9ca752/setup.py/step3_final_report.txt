  "purpose": "Detect and evaluate potential malicious behavior in the Python package setup code, focusing on obfuscated PowerShell execution and hidden activities.",
  "sources": "Filesystem check for 'tahg' directory; execution of encoded PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen; setup() function call.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the encoded PowerShell command; silent subprocess creation with hidden window; broad exception handling suppressing errors.",
  "flows": "Filesystem check triggers execution of obfuscated PowerShell command; command runs silently, potentially executing malicious payloads without detection.",
  "anomalies": "Use of Base64-encoded PowerShell command; silent execution with no validation or logging; broad try-except blocks hiding errors; conditional code based on directory absence.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a directory check, then executes an obfuscated PowerShell command silently if the directory does not exist. The command is encoded, likely to conceal malicious payloads. The subprocess runs with no window, and errors are suppressed silently, which can hide failures or malicious activity. The setup() call appears benign but is used as a cover for executing hidden code. The pattern aligns with common malware tactics such as covert payload delivery, obfuscation, and concealment of execution. Scores assigned in the reports (malware 0.75-0.8, obfuscated 0.8-0.9, risk 0.75-0.8) are consistent with this behavior. Without decoding the PowerShell command, certainty cannot be absolute, but the suspicious pattern justifies high malware suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits behaviors characteristic of malicious activity, including obfuscation, silent execution, and concealment. The high scores across reports are justified. It is recommended to treat this package as potentially malicious and further decode the PowerShell command to confirm payload details.",
