      "conclusion": "The code contains a clear malicious reverse shell payload embedded in a setup script, with obfuscation to hide intent. It poses a severe security threat by enabling remote control of the host system during package installation. The high malware, obfuscation, and risk scores are justified and consistent with the code's behavior."
