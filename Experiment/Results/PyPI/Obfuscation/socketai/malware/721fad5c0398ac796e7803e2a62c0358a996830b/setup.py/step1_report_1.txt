{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom setuptools installation command that, upon installation, establishes a reverse shell connection to a specified IP address and port.",
  "sources": "The code reads input/output from the socket connection established to the IP 85.159.212.47 on port 61985.",
  "sinks": "The socket connection is used as a sink for input/output redirection, ultimately spawning a shell and redirecting its stdin, stdout, and stderr to the socket.",
  "flows": "The code creates a socket connection to the remote server, duplicates the socket's file descriptor to stdin, stdout, and stderr, then spawns a shell ('/bin/sh') with these redirected streams, enabling remote command execution.",
  "anomalies": "The class name 'umWRXCRBjNUvFeyYeLdgCqKuuVCFJrHO' appears obfuscated. The code establishes a reverse shell during package installation, which is highly unusual and suspicious behavior for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and defines a custom installation class that overrides the 'run' method (incorrectly named 'JOeDflGWIKETizSWcbjUFMCAyRTjlwOk') which executes code upon installation. The method creates a socket connection to an external IP and port, redirects standard input/output/error to this socket, and spawns a shell. This behavior allows remote control of the machine once the package is installed. The code is intentionally obfuscated with a nonsensical class name, indicating malicious intent or at least suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious reverse shell triggered during package installation, enabling remote access and control of the host system. The obfuscated class name and the network connection to an external IP strongly suggest malicious intent. This package poses a significant security risk and should not be used.",
