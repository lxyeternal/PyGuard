  "purpose": "Establishes a reverse shell during package installation by connecting to a remote IP, redirecting I/O, and spawning a shell.",
  "sources": "Socket connection to hardcoded IP and port, reading no external untrusted input.",
  "sinks": "Spawning a shell (`/bin/sh`) with redirected I/O streams, enabling remote command execution.",
  "flows": "Socket connection -> dup2 to stdin/stdout/stderr -> pty.spawn('/bin/sh')",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names, execution during setup, hardcoded IP and port, reverse shell payload.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that, when invoked, creates a socket to a specific IP and port, duplicates the socket's file descriptor to standard input/output/error, and spawns a shell, effectively creating a reverse shell backdoor during package installation. The obfuscated class and method names suggest an attempt to conceal malicious intent. The code's behavior is straightforward and clearly malicious, with no benign purpose. The high severity of this activity justifies high malware and security risk scores. The obfuscation score is justified by the nonsensical identifiers. The code does not sanitize or validate any input, but it does not read external untrusted data; it simply initiates a connection and spawns a shell, which is inherently malicious in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a clear malicious reverse shell payload embedded in a setup script, with obfuscation to hide intent. It poses a severe security threat by enabling remote control of the host system during package installation. The high malware, obfuscation, and risk scores are justified and consistent with the code's behavior.",
