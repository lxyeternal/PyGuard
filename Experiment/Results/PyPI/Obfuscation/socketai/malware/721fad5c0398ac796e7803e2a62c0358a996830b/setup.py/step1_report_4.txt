{
  "purpose": "This code defines a custom setup process that, during installation, establishes a reverse shell connection to a remote server, potentially allowing remote code execution.",
  "sources": "The socket connection to 85.159.212.47 on port 61985, executed during the installation process within the custom 'install' command class.",
  "sinks": "The os.dup2 calls redirect standard input, output, and error to the socket connection; pty.spawn('/bin/sh') spawns a shell over this connection.",
  "flows": "The code initiates a network connection to the remote server, redirects system I/O streams to this connection, and then spawns an interactive shell, allowing remote command execution.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a hardcoded IP address and port used for a reverse shell. The class name and method names are obfuscated and non-descriptive. The code executes during the setup process, which is unusual and suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is part of a setup script for a Python package, which normally should only handle package installation. Instead, it injects malicious behavior by establishing a reverse shell to an external IP address during installation. The obfuscated class and method names suggest an attempt to conceal malicious intent. The use of socket, os, and pty modules to create a reverse shell is a strong indicator of malicious activity. No other suspicious code or obfuscation patterns are present. The code runs as part of the package setup process, which is highly unusual and potentially malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains malicious code that, when installed, establishes a reverse shell to a remote server, enabling remote control over the host system. The behavior is highly suspicious and indicative of malicious intent.",
