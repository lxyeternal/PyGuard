{
  "purpose": "The code modifies the installation process of a Python package, embedding a backdoor that connects to a remote server and spawns a shell.",
  "sources": "The socket connection details are hardcoded in the method 'JOeDflGWIKETizSWcbjUFMCAyRTjlwOk', which is called during package installation.",
  "sinks": "The socket connection is used as a sink; it forwards input/output streams to a remote server, enabling remote code execution and control.",
  "flows": "During installation, the code establishes a socket connection to a remote server at 85.159.212.47:61985, duplicates the socket's file descriptor to stdin, stdout, and stderr, then spawns a shell ('/bin/sh') over this connection, creating a reverse shell.",
  "anomalies": "The class and method names are obfuscated, and the socket connection details are hardcoded. The code executes a reverse shell during the package installation process, which is highly suspicious and unusual for typical package setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom setuptools command that overrides the install process. Within this override, it establishes a network connection to a remote IP and port, then redirects the system's input/output/error streams to this connection and spawns an interactive shell. This behavior resembles a reverse shell, which allows remote control over the system during installation. The use of obfuscated names and embedding this functionality in a setup script strongly suggests malicious intent. The connection to an external server during package installation is a typical indicator of malicious activity, aimed at compromising the system.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains a malicious backdoor that creates a reverse shell during package installation, allowing remote attackers to gain control of the host system. The hardcoded IP address, obfuscated code, and reverse shell mechanism confirm malicious intent.",
