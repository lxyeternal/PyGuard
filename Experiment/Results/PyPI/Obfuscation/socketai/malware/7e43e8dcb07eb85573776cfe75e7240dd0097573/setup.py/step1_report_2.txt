{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package that, upon installation, writes a script that creates a reverse shell connection to a specific IP address, enabling remote access to the system.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from socket connections, writes to files ('remote-access.py'), and reads system information (hostname). It also reads package metadata and configuration files during setup.",
  "sinks": "The code writes a reverse shell script to disk and executes it via subprocess.Popen. It also attempts to connect to a hardcoded IP address and port, then potentially allows remote command execution.",
  "flows": "Input (hostname, socket data) flows into the creation of the 'remote-access.py' script. The script is then written to disk and executed, establishing a network connection back to a specific IP, potentially allowing remote control.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains obfuscated variable names and a large embedded string that implements reverse shell functionality. It writes and executes a script designed for remote access, which is not typical for legitimate package setup scripts. Hardcoded IP address ('82.157.252.61') and port, with continuous connection attempts, indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a reverse shell mechanism embedded as a string, which is then written to a file during package installation. The installer class ('gMXqmeqMRVRGDIPqEuNRsPUnAsRUNNmM') overrides the 'install' command to include this behavior. It creates a 'remote-access.py' file, moves it to a user directory, and attempts to execute it with Python. The reverse shell connects to a fixed IP address and port, granting remote control over the compromised system. The code employs obfuscation via obscure variable names and embedded code, aiming to hide malicious functionality. This pattern indicates an intentional backdoor designed for remote system access, which is malicious in the context of package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains embedded malicious functionality, creating a remote access backdoor during package installation. It uses obfuscation and hardcoded IP/port, which strongly suggests malicious intent. This package should be considered dangerous and unsafe for use.",
