{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed to create a Python package that, upon installation, writes and executes a remote access script, enabling an attacker to establish remote control over the victim's machine via socket connections.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from socket connections, specifically in the 'getRemoteAccess' function, which attempts to connect to a hardcoded IP address. It also reads and writes files ('remote-access.py').",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the subprocess call that executes the 'remote-access.py' script, which establishes reverse shell functionality, and the creation of a script that, once executed, can provide remote command execution capabilities.",
  "flows": "Data flows from hardcoded IP and socket connections in 'getRemoteAccess' to remote command execution via subprocess. The script writes malicious code to 'remote-access.py' and then executes it, establishing a remote access channel.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically writes a malicious script intended for remote access, including hardcoded IP addresses, and attempts to execute this script automatically upon package installation. The 'install' class is overridden to inject this behavior. The script sets up reverse shells for both Windows and Linux, which is highly suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports system modules and overrides the 'install' command of setuptools to execute malicious behavior during package installation. It creates a script ('remote-access.py') containing code that establishes reverse shells to a specific IP address. The script is saved in the user's directory, then automatically executed, creating a persistent remote access backdoor. The script supports both Windows and Linux platforms, with hardcoded IP addresses and ports, enabling remote control. This behavior aligns with typical remote access trojans (RATs). The code's obfuscation, such as non-descriptive variable names and writing of malicious code during setup, indicates malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, designed to establish a backdoor by injecting a remote access script into the victim's system during package installation. It contains hardcoded IP addresses, automatically executes remote control scripts, and supports multiple operating systems, indicating high malicious intent.",
