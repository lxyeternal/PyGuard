{
  "purpose": "The code embeds a reverse shell payload intended to establish remote control over the host system during package installation, creating a backdoor for an attacker.",
  "sources": "The embedded string containing reverse shell code, which is written to 'remote-access.py', and the hardcoded IP address and port used for establishing network connections.",
  "sinks": "Writing the malicious script to disk, moving it into user directories, executing it via subprocess, and establishing socket connections to the attacker's server.",
  "flows": "The code generates reverse shell payloads, writes them to a file, moves the file into the user's directory, and executes it, resulting in a persistent remote connection to the attacker's server.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names, embedded malicious code for both Windows and Linux, hardcoded IP address, automatic execution during setup, and threading to maintain persistent access.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a malicious reverse shell payload that is written and executed during package installation, connecting to a fixed IP address. Obfuscated variable names and embedded multi-platform reverse shell code indicate malicious intent. The setup process automatically establishes a remote backdoor, which can be used for unauthorized system control. The scores assigned (malware=1, securityRisk=1, obfuscated≈0.8) are consistent with the evidence. The code's behavior is clearly malicious, with no false assumptions present.",
  "conclusion": "The package includes embedded malicious reverse shell code that creates a persistent backdoor, connecting to a hardcoded IP during installation. The behavior is malicious, and the scores accurately reflect the severity. The package should be flagged and removed from distribution channels.",
