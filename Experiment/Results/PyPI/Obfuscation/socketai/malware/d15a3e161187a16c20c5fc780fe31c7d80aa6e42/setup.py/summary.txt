  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious behavior due to obfuscated, stealthy PowerShell execution during package setup. The high obfuscation, stealth flags, and silent error handling align with common malware tactics. The scores provided are justified and consistent with the observed behavior. It should be treated as highly suspicious and subjected to further analysis, including decoding the payload to confirm malicious activity."
