  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script, likely intended for general data processing or utility functions. No explicit purpose is clear from the provided snippet.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, user input functions, or external modules that may load data from files or network requests.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, subprocess executions, or system calls that could be exploited if untrusted data is processed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or user input through processing functions to sinks like network sockets, files, or subprocess calls.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious function calls are detected in the provided code snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code structure was examined for common malicious patterns, including code injection, data leakage, or backdoors. The code appears to be straightforward with no unusual dynamic execution or obfuscated logic. Usage of third-party libraries is standard and does not raise suspicion. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious network activity are evident.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code appears to be benign, but this assessment is limited to the visible code snippet and does not account for external or runtime behaviors.",
