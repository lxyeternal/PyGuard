  "conclusion": "Most code is benign with low security risk; Report 3 demonstrates clear malicious indicators justifying high malware and obfuscation scores. The overall security threat is moderate, primarily due to the malicious sample. The scores are consistent with the evidence; no further adjustments are necessary."
