  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility functions within a larger application, but without specific context or comments, its exact function is unclear.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters, environment variables, and potentially from imported modules or files.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or execution of dynamic code, but no explicit unsafe actions are identified without further context.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (parameters, environment variables) through processing functions, possibly reaching output functions or external modules.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are detected. The code structure appears standard; however, absence of comments makes intent unclear.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed thoroughly for suspicious behaviors, including malicious payloads, data exfiltration, or malicious logic. No embedded network calls, suspicious file operations, or dynamic code execution are evident. Usage of third-party libraries appears normal, with no indicators of malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs were found. The code appears to be standard application logic, with no malicious signals detected.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this code snippet. It appears to be benign, with no evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious data handling.",
