  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code patterns, obfuscation, and suspicious activities.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, hardcoded IPs/domains, file reads, network connections, subprocess calls, eval/exec usage.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, subprocess executions, data exfiltration points, environment variables, file writes.",
  "flows": "Input sources (environment, user input, hardcoded data) to sinks (network, subprocess, file operations), potentially via dynamic code execution or obfuscated variables.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded IPs/domains, use of eval/exec, obfuscated variable names, suspicious control flow, dynamic code execution, network communication with suspicious endpoints.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits typical benign patterns in most reports, with no suspicious signals. Report 3 shows significant anomalies: hardcoded IPs, eval/exec, obfuscation, and network activity indicating malicious intent. Scores in reports align with their descriptions: benign reports have malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2; malicious report (Report 3) has malware=0.75, obfuscated=0.6, risk=0.8. The overall assessment should weight the malicious indicators heavily, resulting in a malware score around 0.7, obfuscated around 0.5, and security risk approximately 0.6.",
  "conclusion": "Most code is benign with low security risk; Report 3 demonstrates clear malicious indicators justifying high malware and obfuscation scores. The overall security threat is moderate, primarily due to the malicious sample. The scores are consistent with the evidence; no further adjustments are necessary.",
