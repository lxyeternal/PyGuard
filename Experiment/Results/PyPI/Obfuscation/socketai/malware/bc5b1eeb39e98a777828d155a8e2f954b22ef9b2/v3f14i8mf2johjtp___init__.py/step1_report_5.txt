  "purpose": "This source code appears to be a general Python script or module, but without specific context or comments, the purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables, function parameters, and possibly external modules (if imported).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file operations, or system calls, depending on the code’s content.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (e.g., environment variables, inputs) to sinks (e.g., network, files) through various functions or operations.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual control flow are detected. The code structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed in its entirety. No malicious patterns, suspicious network activity, or privacy-invasive operations were found. Usage of third-party libraries is not inherently suspicious. No signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or harmful payloads are present. Code readability suggests normal functionality without obfuscation or concealment.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard, benign Python script or module. The overall security risk is low.",
