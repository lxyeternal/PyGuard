      "conclusion": "The code exhibits behaviors characteristic of malicious activity, including obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during package setup. The evidence supports classifying this as highly suspicious and potentially malicious, justifying high malware, obfuscation, and risk scores. Further decoding of the payload is recommended to confirm malicious intent."
