  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks, focusing on code analysis, data flows, and anomalies.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, file reads, network communication, module imports (e.g., requests).",
  "sinks": "Dynamic code execution (eval/exec), network transmissions, file writes, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Input sources (user/env) potentially leading to eval/exec or network activity; data read from environment/files possibly transmitted or processed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec on untrusted input (not explicitly confirmed but suspected in some reports), lack of comments or context, unverified data flows.",
  "analysis": "Most reports correctly identify the absence of malware and obfuscation, with scores reflecting cautious assessment. Report 1 highlights unsafe eval/exec practices, which pose a security risk but do not constitute malware. Scores are consistent with observations: malware at 0, obfuscated at 0, risk around 0.2-0.4. The overall evaluation aligns with the evidence; no significant anomalies or malicious code are confirmed. The main concern is unsafe dynamic code execution, which warrants attention but not a malware classification.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency code shows no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The primary security concern is unsafe eval/exec usage, which is appropriately reflected in the risk scores. All reports' scores are consistent with their analyses, and no modifications are necessary.",
