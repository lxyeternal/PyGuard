  "purpose": "Establish a reverse shell connection to a specified IP and port, providing remote control over the host system.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (os.putenv), socket connection (s.connect), spawning a shell (/bin/bash).",
  "sinks": "os.dup2 (redirecting socket to stdin, stdout, stderr), pty.spawn (launching shell), socket close.",
  "flows": "Socket connection receives commands from remote attacker → os.dup2 redirects socket file descriptor to standard input/output/error → pty.spawn executes bash shell, allowing remote command execution.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded IP address and port for reverse shell; environment variable HISTFILE is set to null to prevent command history logging; direct socket manipulation and spawning shell without checks or authentication.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a socket connection to a specific external IP (3.228.3.164) on port 80, then redirects standard input, output, and error streams to this socket. It sets the environment variable HISTFILE to /dev/null, likely to avoid history logging, and spawns a bash shell, effectively giving an attacker full remote control of the system. This pattern is characteristic of malicious backdoors or remote access trojans, intended for unauthorized remote control and stealth. The use of hardcoded IP, the environment variable manipulation, and direct shell spawning without any authentication strongly indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a reverse shell backdoor, enabling remote control over the compromised system. It exhibits malicious behavior with high confidence, as it directly facilitates unauthorized remote access with no security checks.",
