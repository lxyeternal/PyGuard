  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks based on provided code snippets or analysis reports.",
  "sources": "Input data, code snippets, or analysis reports; no specific code sources provided.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network communications, or execution points where untrusted data could cause harm, but none explicitly identified due to lack of code.",
  "flows": "Not determinable without code; analysis based on reports indicating absence of suspicious flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; all reports indicate no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "All reports lack actual code snippets, relying on high-level assessments. Scores for malware and obfuscation are consistently zero, aligning with the absence of suspicious patterns or obfuscation. Confidence levels vary but are generally appropriate given the limited information. Security risk scores are low (0.1-0.2), reflecting cautious optimism. The evaluations are internally consistent and reasonable across all reports.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided reports and their reasoning, there is no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the available information. No adjustments are necessary unless new code or evidence emerges.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
