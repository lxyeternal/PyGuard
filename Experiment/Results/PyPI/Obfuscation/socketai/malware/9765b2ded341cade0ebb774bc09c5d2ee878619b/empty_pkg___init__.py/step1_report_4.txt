  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a specific task based on user input or data processing, although the exact function is unclear due to lack of context.",
  "sources": "Data is read from environment variables, user inputs, or imported modules; specific source points are not explicitly identified in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, file operations, or data processing functions that could leak data or execute commands based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input or environment sources to processing functions and potentially to output or network transmission points.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are visible. No obfuscated code or uncommon language features are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be straightforward with standard Python constructs. No malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or unauthorized network connections is evident. Usage of third-party libraries is typical, and no suspicious patterns are present. The absence of context limits a definitive assessment, but based on the visible code, there are no indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit signs of malware or malicious behavior based on the current analysis. It seems to serve a legitimate purpose without security risks identified in this snippet.",
