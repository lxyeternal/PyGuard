  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed to modify the system environment and clone repositories from GitHub, then execute a file from the cloned directory, potentially for malicious purposes such as persistence or executing arbitrary code.",
  "sources": "os.getlogin(), os.environ, os.path.exists(), os.makedirs(), os.listdir(), os.rename(), os.startfile()",
  "sinks": "os.makedirs(), git.Git().clone(), os.rename(), os.startfile()",
  "flows": "Reads system login info -> creates directories -> clones repositories -> moves files -> executes a file",
  "anomalies": "Creates directories in startup paths, clones external repositories, renames files, executes a potentially malicious executable, and modifies startup folders without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, during installation, manipulates the Windows startup folders to establish persistence. It clones two GitHub repositories into specific startup directories, then renames a file named 'test.py' to another 'test.py' in a different directory, likely to hide or execute malicious code. Finally, it executes an EXE file from a subdirectory, which could be malicious. These actions are typical for malware persistence, remote code execution, or backdoor setup. The presence of hardcoded repository URLs and the manipulation of startup items are strong indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits high malicious intent, creating persistence mechanisms, cloning external malicious repositories, and executing potentially harmful executables. The actions strongly suggest malicious activity, such as backdoor installation or system compromise.",
