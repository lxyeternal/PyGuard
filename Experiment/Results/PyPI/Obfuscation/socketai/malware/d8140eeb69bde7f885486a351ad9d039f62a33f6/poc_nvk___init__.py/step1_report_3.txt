{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is to perform some form of data processing, possibly involving network communication or system interaction, but specific intent cannot be determined without seeing actual code content.",
  "sources": "Data sources include environment variables, input functions, or external libraries that may read files, network data, or user input.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network sockets, file writes, system commands, or use of eval/exec functions that could execute untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (e.g., environment variables, user input) through processing functions to sinks (e.g., network, system commands).",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies detected due to absence of code content. Potential concerns could include hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, or obscure imports if present.",
  "analysis": "Without actual code content, the analysis relies on standard security considerations. Watch for use of eval, exec, dynamic import, hardcoded secrets, or network connections. The code structure appears standard; no suspicious patterns can be confirmed without specific code snippets. Verify that third-party libraries used are reputable. No obfuscated code or malware signatures are apparent from the prompt. Risk assessment is limited by lack of detailed code.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of visible code, there are no apparent malicious behaviors or security issues. However, the final assessment depends on inspecting actual code content for hidden malicious patterns.",
