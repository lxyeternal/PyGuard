{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be related to a Python package potentially meant for general utility or specific functionality, but the exact purpose cannot be determined from the code provided, as no code was included.",
  "sources": "Input sources could include environment variables, user input functions, file reads, or network requests, but no specific source code is provided to identify such points.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network transmission functions, file write operations, subprocess executions, or sensitive data handling points, but no explicit sinks are observable due to lack of code.",
  "flows": "Data flow paths from input sources to sinks cannot be mapped without actual code; typically, these would involve data being read, processed, and then output or transmitted.",
  "anomalies": "No code provided for analysis; therefore, no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious code patterns, or obfuscation can be identified.",
  "analysis": "No source code has been provided for review, preventing any detailed analysis. All assessment steps—identifying sources, sinks, flows, anomalies—are not applicable without code content.",
  "conclusion": "No code was supplied for review; therefore, no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation can be confirmed. Based on the absence of code, the security posture cannot be assessed.",
