  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, OS, IP address) and send it to a specified remote server.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), platform.system(), socket.gethostbyname(), input URL in requests.post",
  "sinks": "requests.post() with system info sent to remote URL",
  "flows": "Collect system data -> send via POST request to remote server",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function and variable names, URL domain appears suspicious (not a well-known domain), code is designed solely to exfiltrate system info without user consent",
  "analysis": "The code gathers hostname, OS name, and IP address using socket and platform modules. It constructs a JSON payload with this data and sends it to a hardcoded URL. The function naming is obscure, indicating potential intent to hide malicious activity. No user input is involved, and the data is only system info; however, the exfiltration to an external server without user awareness suggests malicious intent. There are no clear signs of data leakage beyond system info, but the purpose aligns with covert data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "This script collects basic system information and sends it to a remote server, indicating potential malicious behavior related to system data exfiltration. The obfuscated naming and covert nature increase suspicion, although it does not contain more harmful malware actions like code injection or file manipulation.",
