  "anomalies": "Code performs system information collection and data transmission without user consent, uses obfuscated function names, and transmits data to a suspicious domain (eowdq5q6u6qkhxe.m.pipedream.net). The domain may be controlled by an attacker. The URL is hardcoded, and the code has no clear legitimate purpose.",
  "analysis": "The script collects hostname, OS name, and IP address of the local machine, which are typical system info. It then sends this info via an HTTP POST request to a specified URL, which is suspicious since it transmits potentially sensitive info without user awareness. The code does not have any obvious malicious payload like damaging files, keylogging, or backdoors, but it does perform data exfiltration. The function and variable names are obfuscated, indicating potential concealment. The use of a hardcoded URL pointing to an external server suggests a possible malicious intent, such as tracking or information theft. No malicious code injection, code obfuscation techniques beyond naming, or malware-like behavior is evident, but the act of collecting and transmitting system info without consent is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs system information gathering and transmits this data to an external server without user consent, which could be used for malicious tracking or reconnaissance. Although no destructive actions are present, the behavior is potentially malicious due to unapproved data exfiltration. The obfuscated naming and external communication are red flags.",
