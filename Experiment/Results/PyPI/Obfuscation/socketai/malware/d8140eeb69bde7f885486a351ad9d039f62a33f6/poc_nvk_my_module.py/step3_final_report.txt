  "purpose": "Collects system hostname, OS name, and IP address, then sends this information via HTTP POST to a specified URL.",

  "sinks": "requests.post() to external URL with system info as JSON",
  "flows": "Source functions gather data -> data stored in dictionary -> data sent via requests.post() to URL",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function and variable names; hardcoded URL to suspicious domain; exception handling references undefined variable 'response'; no user consent prompts",
  "analysis": "The code collects system information and exfiltrates it to an external server without user consent, indicating potential privacy invasion. Obfuscated naming suggests an attempt to conceal intent. The URL used is suspicious, often associated with testing or malicious exfiltration. The exception handling bug reflects poor coding practices but not malicious intent. No malicious payloads like code injection or destructive actions are present. The behavior aligns with reconnaissance or data collection activities that could be malicious depending on context. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.3, obfuscation ~0.8, security risk ~0.6) are consistent with this analysis, though the malware score could be slightly lowered given the absence of active malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior primarily due to covert data exfiltration to a suspicious URL and obfuscation, but lacks active malware payloads. The risk is moderate, mainly concerning privacy invasion. The scores in the reports are appropriate, with minor adjustments to reflect the lack of malicious payloads. Overall, it warrants caution and further review if used in production environments.",
