  "purpose": "Collects hostname, OS, and IP address of the system and sends this data via an HTTP POST request to a specified URL.",
  "sources": "Reads hostname (`socket.gethostname()`), OS name (`platform.system()`), and local IP address (`socket.gethostbyname()`); uses these as input data for HTTP request.",
  "sinks": "Sends data through `requests.post()` to an external URL, potentially leaking system information.",
  "flows": "Sources (hostname, OS, IP) → JSON object → `requests.post()` to external server.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. The code communicates system info to an external server without user consent or explicit purpose. The URL used is a subdomain of pipedream.net, which could be suspicious depending on context. The exception handling references an undefined variable `response`, which is a bug, not malicious but indicates poor code quality.",
  "analysis": "The code collects basic system information and sends it to a remote URL without any user interaction or validation. The URL is hardcoded and external, which could be used maliciously for fingerprinting or data collection. There is no obfuscation or suspicious code constructs. The exception handling references an undefined variable, indicating a bug but no malicious intent. Overall, the code appears to be used for system fingerprinting or data exfiltration, which could be malicious if done without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "The script gathers system info and exfiltrates it to an external server, which can be considered malicious behavior depending on context. The code does not contain obfuscation or typical malware signatures but performs data collection and transfer that can be used maliciously.",
