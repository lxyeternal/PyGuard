      "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior primarily due to covert data exfiltration to a suspicious URL and obfuscation, but lacks active malware payloads. The risk is moderate, mainly concerning privacy invasion. The scores in the reports are appropriate, with minor adjustments to reflect the lack of malicious payloads. Overall, it warrants caution and further review if used in production environments."

      "conclusion": "Based on the descriptions, the dependency shows no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk scores are appropriate, and the assessments are consistent. No further action or code review is possible without actual code snippets. The current scores and conclusions are justified and appropriate."
