{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a custom setup script for a Python package, including a custom install command that runs an additional module during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package metadata, custom command class, and calls subprocess with a command to run a module.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess call executes a module ('poc_nvk.my_module') using the current Python interpreter, which could potentially execute arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom install command runs 'sys.executable -m poc_nvk.my_module', potentially executing untrusted code if the module is malicious or compromised.",
  "anomalies": [
    "Use of an obfuscated class name 'QeKmMaNjThIEGOHoHWWWHCQbvGrGlXHE' and method name 'uxWHPTOKuJXGidcfnJSTTxoxhmCIsNLi'.",
    "The subprocess call is using a method 'uxWHPTOKuJXGidcfnJSTTxoxhmCIsNLi' which is highly unusual and obfuscated.",
    "No import of 'sys' module, yet 'sys.executable' is used in subprocess call, indicating a likely missing import, which could cause runtime errors or suggest code tampering."
  ],
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom install class that inherits from setuptools' install. It overrides a method with an obfuscated name and attempts to execute a module via subprocess during installation. The absence of an import statement for 'sys' suggests the code may be intentionally obfuscated or incomplete. Running 'subprocess' with a potentially malicious module ('poc_nvk.my_module') during install could lead to arbitrary code execution if the module is malicious. The obfuscation of class and method names raises suspicion about concealment or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and executes a module during setup, which could be malicious if the module is harmful. The missing 'sys' import indicates either incomplete code or intentional obfuscation, heightening suspicion. Overall, this package has a high potential for malicious behavior due to the dynamic execution of code during installation.",
