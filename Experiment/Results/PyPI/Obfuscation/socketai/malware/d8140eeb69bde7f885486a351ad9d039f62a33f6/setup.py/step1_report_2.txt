{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package that defines a custom installation class which runs an external module during installation.",
  "sources": "sys.executable and subprocess.uxWHPTOKuJXGidcfnJSTTxoxhmCIsNLi() (which appears to be an obfuscated or incorrect method call), as well as the code execution in the custom install class.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.uxWHPTOKuJXGidcfnJSTTxoxhmCIsNLi([sys.executable, '-m', 'poc_nvk.my_module']) potentially executes an external Python module, which could be malicious if 'poc_nvk.my_module' is malicious or obfuscated.",
  "flows": "Code reads system Python executable path, then executes a module 'poc_nvk.my_module' via subprocess during install, creating a source-to-sink flow where untrusted code could be executed at install time.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated or nonsensical class and method names (e.g., QeKmMaNjThIEGOHoHWWWHCQbvGrGlXHE, uxWHPTOKuJXGidcfnJSTTxoxhmCIsNLi), and an incorrect or malicious subprocess call that appears intentionally obfuscated. The setup script also contains a non-standard attribute 'MgsnrmQwvyitqkfvHJXCATlkqttCLIII' instead of standard 'long_description' or similar.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom install class that overrides the 'uxWHPTOKuJXGidcfnJSTTxoxhmCIsNLi' method (which is likely meant to be 'run'), but the method implementation calls itself recursively instead of the parent method, which would lead to an error or be intentionally obfuscated. The subprocess call is attempting to run a module 'poc_nvk.my_module', which could execute arbitrary malicious code during package installation. The class and method names are intentionally obfuscated, indicating an attempt to hide malicious intent. The presence of such code in a setup script suggests potential malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage, especially if 'poc_nvk.my_module' is malicious or unknown.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to contain obfuscated and potentially malicious elements, notably executing an external module during installation, which could be used for malicious purposes. The unusual naming and method calls suggest an attempt to hide malicious behavior or sabotage the supply chain.",
