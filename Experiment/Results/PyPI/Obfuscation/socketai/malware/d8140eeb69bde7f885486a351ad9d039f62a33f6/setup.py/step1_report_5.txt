{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be a setup configuration for a Python package, defining a custom installation class that runs an additional module during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the setuptools library, the subprocess module (implied but not explicitly imported), and the sys module (not imported).",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.call function executes an external module ('poc_nvk.my_module'), which can execute arbitrary code. The usage of subprocess and sys indicates potential for executing untrusted code.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom class method invokes subprocess with the sys.executable to run 'poc_nvk.my_module', establishing a flow from the install process to executing external code.",
  "anomalies": "The class name and method names are obfuscated (non-meaningful, random strings). The subprocess call is invoked via a method with a non-descriptive name, which may hide malicious intent. The module 'poc_nvk.my_module' appears suspicious, possibly a placeholder or a malicious module, especially given the obfuscated code context. Import of sys is missing, which would cause runtime errors if executed as-is.",
  "analysis": "The code is designed to run during package installation, extending setuptools' install command with a custom class. The custom class's method executes a module 'poc_nvk.my_module' via subprocess, which could execute arbitrary code on the target system. The obfuscated class and method names, along with the invocation of an external module during setup, are suspicious. The missing import of sys indicates incomplete or intentionally obfuscated code. Such behavior can be used for malicious purposes, such as code execution, backdoors, or installing malware during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious obfuscation and executes an external module during setup, which is typical of malicious supply chain behavior. The code could be malicious if 'poc_nvk.my_module' contains harmful payloads. The missing sys import is likely an oversight or intentional obfuscation, but the core behavior is risky.",
