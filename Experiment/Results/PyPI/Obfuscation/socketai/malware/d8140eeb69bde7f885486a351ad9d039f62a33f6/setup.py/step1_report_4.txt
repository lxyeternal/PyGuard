{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, including a custom installation command that executes a subprocess during installation.",
  "sources": "The subprocess call within the custom install class; the sys.executable used to invoke a module.",
  "sinks": "Execution of subprocess with potentially untrusted or hidden module 'poc_nvk.my_module'.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom class method runs 'subprocess.uxWHPTOKuJXGidcfnJSTTxoxhmCIsNLi' which is intended to execute a Python module 'poc_nvk.my_module' using the current Python interpreter.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated method name 'uxWHPTOKuJXGidcfnJSTTxoxhmCIsNLi' and class name 'QeKmMaNjThIEGOHoHWWWHCQbvGrGlXHE' are suspicious; they seem intentionally obfuscated. The call to subprocess with an unusual method 'uxWHPTOKuJXGidcfnJSTTxoxhmCIsNLi' is suspicious, especially since it's likely meant to execute code.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom install class that overrides the default 'install' command. Within this overridden method, it calls an obfuscated method that appears to invoke 'subprocess.uxWHPTOKuJXGidcfnJSTTxoxhmCIsNLi', which is not a standard subprocess method. This is likely a typo or an obfuscation of 'subprocess.run' or similar. The intent seems to be to run a module 'poc_nvk.my_module' during installation, which could be malicious if the module performs harmful actions. The obfuscated names, combined with the execution of a potentially hidden module, raise suspicion of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a setup script with obfuscated names and a subprocess call during installation that executes an external module. Given the obfuscation and the potential for executing hidden or malicious code during setup, this poses a security risk and could be malicious. The use of obfuscated names and execution of external modules during install is highly suspicious.",
