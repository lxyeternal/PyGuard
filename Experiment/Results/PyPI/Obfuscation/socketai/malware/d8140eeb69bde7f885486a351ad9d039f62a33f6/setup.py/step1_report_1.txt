  "purpose": "Customize the installation process of a Python package to run an external module during installation.",
  "sources": "Import statements, subprocess call in the custom install class, reading of package setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.uxWHPTOKuJXGidcfnJSTTxoxhmCIsNLi() call, which executes an external Python module; use of sys.executable to run 'poc_nvk.my_module'.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom install class runs 'poc_nvk.my_module' via subprocess, potentially executing arbitrary code.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names, unconventional variable naming, and dynamic subprocess execution with suspiciously named methods and variables.",
  "analysis": "The code modifies the standard setup process by defining a custom install command class with obfuscated identifiers. The method 'uxWHPTOKuJXGidcfnJSTTxoxhmCIsNLi' calls a similarly obfuscated subprocess method, likely intended to execute a module ('poc_nvk.my_module') using the current Python interpreter. The use of obfuscated names suggests an attempt to conceal malicious intent. The subprocess call could execute arbitrary code without clear visibility. The setup configuration also includes an unusual key 'MgsnrmQwvyitqkfvHJXCATlkqttCLIII', which appears to be a malformed or obfuscated metadata field.\n\nOverall, this code dynamically executes an external module during installation, which could be malicious, especially given the obfuscation and the indirect call pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated identifiers and executes an external module during installation, which poses a significant security risk. The design suggests an attempt to conceal malicious behavior, such as executing arbitrary code during package install. The overall security risk is high, and this package should be treated as potentially malicious until further investigation confirms its intent.",
