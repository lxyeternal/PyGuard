  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential, involving stealthy browser extension hijacking, obfuscated malicious scripts, and persistence tactics. The high scores assigned in the reports (malware 0.9, obfuscated 0.9, risk 0.9) are justified. The activities are consistent with malware designed for covert data interception, persistence, and system compromise. The overall security risk is serious and warrants immediate attention."
