{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a utility or data processing script with no suspicious or malicious patterns detected.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from standard input, environment variables, or external files, depending on implementation details.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system commands, network requests, or file operations if untrusted data is used unsafely.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) to sinks (system/network/file operations) without evident malicious manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The confidence score is high (0.8) due to thorough review. The security risk is low (0.2), justified by the absence of suspicious patterns and benign structure. Malware score is zero, indicating no malicious intent. The code's purpose appears utility-oriented, with standard practices and no anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code shows no evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. The low security risk score and zero malware score are appropriate. The code is benign, and the supply chain security posture is considered safe.",
