  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a certain function, but the specific intent is unclear due to incomplete information.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from user input, environment variables, and possibly external files or network sources.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system commands, network requests, or data output functions that could be exploited if untrusted data is processed without validation.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as user input or environment variables through processing functions and potentially reaches sinks like system execution or network transmission points.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies detected; code appears standard but incomplete. There is no evidence of hardcoded credentials or suspicious constructs in the visible parts.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet was examined for typical malicious indicators such as code injection points, hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, or obfuscated segments. Since only partial code was provided, the analysis is limited to observable patterns. No suspicious or malicious behavior was identified based on the available code. The structure does not show obfuscation or malicious constructs. All third-party library usage appears standard, and no anomalies like backdoors or hidden functions are evident.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the current analysis, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. However, due to the incomplete nature of the provided code, the confidence in this conclusion is moderate. No malware signs are present, and the security risk appears low.",
  "confidence": 0.7,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.2,
