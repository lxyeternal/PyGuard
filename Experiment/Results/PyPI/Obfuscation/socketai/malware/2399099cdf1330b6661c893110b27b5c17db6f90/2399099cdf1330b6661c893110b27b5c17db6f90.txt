      "confidence": 0.95,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential, involving stealthy browser extension hijacking, obfuscated malicious scripts, and persistence tactics. The high scores assigned in the reports (malware 0.9, obfuscated 0.9, risk 0.9) are justified. The activities are consistent with malware designed for covert data interception, persistence, and system compromise. The overall security risk is serious and warrants immediate attention."

      "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code shows no evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. The low security risk score and zero malware score are appropriate. The code is benign, and the supply chain security posture is considered safe."
