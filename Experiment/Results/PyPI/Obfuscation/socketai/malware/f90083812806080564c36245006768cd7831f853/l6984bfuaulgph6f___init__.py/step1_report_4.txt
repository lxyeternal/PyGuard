  "purpose": "The code appears to be a utility or sample script, possibly for data processing or network interaction, but the exact purpose is unclear without detailed context.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, possibly reads files or network inputs if present, but none are explicitly visible in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes to the console, logs, files, or network destinations if such code exists further in the script.",
  "flows": "Data may flow from environment variables or external inputs to output functions or network calls, but no explicit flows are shown in the provided snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are visible. No obfuscated code, unusual language features, or dynamic code execution are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code review is limited due to lack of the actual code snippet. No malicious patterns such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity are identifiable in the provided information. The structure appears standard, with no signs of obfuscation or malware. Without the actual code content, this review is based on the typical patterns and the absence of suspicious markers.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the current information, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, but a detailed review of the actual code content would be necessary for a definitive assessment.",
