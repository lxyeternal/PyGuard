{
  "purpose": "This code is intended to be part of a Python package setup process, but it includes malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information.",
  "sources": "The code reads system hostname, current working directory, and username using socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), and getpass.getuser().",
  "sinks": "The code sends collected data via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external URL (https://cdf5rwk2vtc0000c78d0ggz1hqeyyyyyb.oast.fun).",
  "flows": "Data is collected from system information functions and then sent through requests.get() to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "The code's class and method names are obfuscated and nonsensical, which is suspicious. It exfiltrates system info without any legitimate setup purpose. The request URL is suspicious and potentially malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an obfuscated class inheriting from setuptools.install, with a method that collects hostname, current directory, and username. It then makes an HTTP GET request to a suspicious domain, passing this info as data. The setup call is standard but is tainted by the malicious method. The obfuscation and data exfiltration indicate malicious intent. The purpose of the setup call is likely to execute this code during installation, secretly exfiltrating user system info.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by secretly collecting and exfiltrating user system information during package installation. The obfuscated names and external contact point suggest intentional malicious activity. It should be considered malware and highly risky.",
