{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to set up a Python package installation process, with a custom install command that reports system information to an external server.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information such as hostname, current working directory, and username.",
  "sinks": "The external HTTP GET request transmits collected system data to a suspicious domain, which could be used for malicious purposes.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, cwd, username) -> request to 'https://cdf5rwk2vtc0000c78d0ggz1hqeyyyyyb.oast.fun' with data as query parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The code secretly collects system info during installation and exfiltrates it without user consent. The domain used appears suspicious and unrelated to typical package operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class inheriting from 'setuptools' install. During installation, it gathers hostname, current working directory, and username. It then makes a GET request to a suspicious external URL, sending the collected data. This behavior is unusual for a benign package and indicates potential malicious data exfiltration. The package metadata appears normal, but the embedded network activity during setup is suspicious and indicates malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting and exfiltrating system information during installation without user consent. This is a supply chain security risk and indicates likely malicious intent.",
