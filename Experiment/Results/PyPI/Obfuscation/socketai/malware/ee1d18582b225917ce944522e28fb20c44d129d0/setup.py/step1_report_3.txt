{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that, upon installation, collects system information and sends it to a remote server.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser() - reading system hostname, current working directory, and username.",
  "sinks": "requests.get() - sending data to a remote server.",
  "flows": "Sources (hostname, cwd, username) -> Data packaged into a dictionary -> Sent via requests.get() to external URL.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a highly obfuscated class and method names, unusual variable naming, and the remote URL appears suspicious and potentially malicious. Data exfiltration behavior is hidden inside the installation process, which is unconventional.",
  "analysis": "The script hooks into the package installation process using a custom class inheriting from setuptools.command.install. During installation, it gathers sensitive system data such as hostname, current working directory, and username. It then exfiltrates this information silently via an HTTP GET request to an external, suspicious domain. The obfuscated class and method names suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent. Such behavior is indicative of a supply chain attack or malicious package aiming to collect user system info without consent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by secretly collecting system information during installation and sending it to an external server. This constitutes a privacy violation and potential security risk. The obfuscation and hidden exfiltration strongly suggest malicious intent, making this package dangerous to use.",
