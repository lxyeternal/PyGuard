{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package that, during installation, gathers system information and sends it to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Socket hostname retrieval (socket.gethostname), current working directory (os.getcwd), current user (getpass.getuser).",
  "sinks": "Requests GET request to a suspicious URL with collected system data as payload.",
  "flows": "System information is collected (sources) and immediately sent via an HTTP GET request to an external domain (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and function names; unusual URL for data exfiltration; data collection occurs during installation, which is hidden behavior; no user consent or transparency.",
  "analysis": "The script imports common modules and defines a custom install class. During installation, it collects hostname, current directory, and username, then sends this data via a GET request to a suspicious external URL. The obfuscated naming and hidden data exfiltration during setup suggest malicious intent or privacy violation. The URL appears malicious, and the code acts without user knowledge. No other malicious actions like code execution, file manipulation, or persistence mechanisms are present, but the data exfiltration behavior is concerning.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains potentially malicious behavior characterized by hidden data exfiltration during package installation, indicative of privacy violation or malicious intent. The obfuscated code and the suspicious URL reinforce this assessment.",
