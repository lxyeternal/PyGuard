{
  "purpose": "The code exfiltrates system hostname, current directory, and username during package installation by sending this data to a suspicious URL, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() to 'https://cdf5rwk2vtc0000c78d0ggz1hqeyyyyyb.oast.fun'",
  "flows": "Data collected from hostname, cwd, username is sent via HTTP GET request to external URL during setup",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names, data exfiltration during installation, suspicious external URL, no user consent",
  "analysis": "The code defines an obfuscated class inheriting from setuptools.install, which during installation collects system info and exfiltrates it via an HTTP request to a suspicious URL. The obfuscation and data exfiltration are clear indicators of malicious behavior. The exfiltration occurs during the setup process, which is unusual and suggests supply chain sabotage. The URL is suspicious, and the obfuscation indicates an attempt to hide malicious intent. The behavior aligns with known malicious patterns of data theft during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating user system information during package installation, with obfuscated code and a suspicious URL, constituting a high security risk and malware activity.",
