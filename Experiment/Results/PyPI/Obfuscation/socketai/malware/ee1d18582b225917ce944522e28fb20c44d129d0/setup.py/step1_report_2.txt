{
  "purpose": "Define a setup configuration for a Python package that, during installation, collects system information and sends it to a remote server.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() with data sent as query parameters",
  "flows": "System information collected via socket, os, and getpass flows into requests.get() to be transmitted to a remote server",
  "anomalies": "Code is obfuscated with non-meaningful class and method names; sending collected system data to a suspicious URL; no validation or user consent shown",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation command that gathers hostname, current working directory, and username. It then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a potentially malicious or tracking domain. The obfuscated naming makes it suspicious, and the data exfiltration occurs during the setup process, which is unusual and potentially malicious. There is no indication of user consent or legitimate purpose for data collection, raising security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to perform unauthorized data collection and exfiltration during package installation, indicating malicious intent or a supply chain attack vector. The obfuscation and data transmission to a suspicious domain strongly suggest malicious behavior.",
