{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract the Roblox security cookie from the Windows Registry and send it to a specified Discord webhook, effectively stealing user credentials.",
  "sources": "The registry key 'HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Roblox\\RobloxStudioBrowser\\roblox.com' and the '.ROBLOSECURITY' value within it.",
  "sinks": "The requests.post() function sending the stolen cookie data to an external webhook URL.",
  "flows": "The code reads the cookie value from the registry (source), extracts the token, and then sends it over the network to an external server (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Obvious malicious intent: the script is aimed at stealing user cookies. The code explicitly targets Roblox Studio's registry data and exfiltrates it via a webhook, which is highly suspicious behavior. The code contains no comments about benign functionality and is titled as a 'Cookie Grabber.'",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary libraries, accesses Windows Registry to locate Roblox Studio cookies, and attempts to extract a specific cookie value. If successful, it posts this sensitive data to a Discord webhook. The entire flow is designed to exfiltrate user credentials without consent. The code structure is straightforward but malicious in intent. It uses exception handling broadly, which can suppress errors but does not hinder malicious activity. No obfuscation is present; the code is clear in its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a clear example of malicious behavior, specifically designed to steal Roblox user cookies and send them to an attacker-controlled server. It exhibits typical characteristics of a credential-stealing malware sample. Due to its intent and actions, it warrants a high-security concern.",
