{
  "purpose": "The code reads the Roblox security cookie from the Windows registry and exfiltrates it via a Discord webhook, indicating malicious intent to steal user credentials.",
  "sources": "Registry key 'SOFTWARE\\Roblox\\RobloxStudioBrowser\\roblox.com' under HKEY_CURRENT_USER, specifically the '.ROBLOSECURITY' value.",
  "sinks": "The requests.post call sending the cookie data to the specified Discord webhook.",
  "flows": "Registry read of '.ROBLOSECURITY' value -> extraction of cookie string -> POST request to webhook with cookie data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad exception handling ('try: pass') suppresses errors; hardcoded webhook URL; straightforward, non-obfuscated code; direct exfiltration of sensitive data.",
  "analysis": "The code accesses a specific registry key to locate the Roblox security cookie, extracts it, and sends it to an external server via HTTP POST. It lacks obfuscation and uses minimal error handling, which could aid stealth. The purpose is clearly malicious, aiming to steal user credentials without consent. The activity is straightforward and aligns with typical credential-stealing malware. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=1, securityRisk=1, obfuscated=0) are justified by the code's behavior. No false positives or misinterpretations are evident. The high risk and malware scores accurately reflect the malicious intent and potential harm.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a clear, straightforward credential-stealing malware targeting Roblox users. It exfiltrates sensitive data silently and without user consent. The activity warrants maximum malware and security risk scores. The code is not obfuscated, and the malicious intent is explicit. The reports accurately assess the severity, and no adjustments are necessary.",
