  "conclusion": "The code is a clear, straightforward credential-stealing malware targeting Roblox users. It exfiltrates sensitive data silently and without user consent. The activity warrants maximum malware and security risk scores. The code is not obfuscated, and the malicious intent is explicit. The reports accurately assess the severity, and no adjustments are necessary."
