  "purpose": "The code is designed to retrieve the Roblox security cookie from the Windows Registry and send it to a specified Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "Reads from Windows Registry key 'SOFTWARE\\Roblox\\RobloxStudioBrowser\\roblox.com' and the '.ROBLOSECURITY' value within it.",
  "sinks": "Sends the stolen cookie to an external webhook URL via an HTTP POST request.",
  "flows": "Reads the registry value '.ROBLOSECURITY' -> extracts the cookie -> sends the cookie via requests.post to the webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "Uses try-except blocks broadly without error handling; hardcoded webhook URL; the purpose of code is malicious (cookie theft). The code appears obfuscated in intent, but not technically obfuscated code. No user input handling; operates solely on registry data.",
  "analysis": "The script accesses the Windows Registry to locate Roblox cookies, extracts the cookie value, and exfiltrates it to a remote server (Discord webhook). It does not perform any benign function. The code's intent is to steal user cookies and transmit them externally, which is malicious. The broad exception handling conceals failures but does not mitigate malicious intent. The webhook URL is hardcoded, indicating the code is designed for malicious exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious as it steals Roblox cookies from the user system and exfiltrates them to an external server. It operates stealthily by hiding errors and using the registry to access sensitive data. Overall, it is a malicious cookie-stealing script with clear malicious intent.",
