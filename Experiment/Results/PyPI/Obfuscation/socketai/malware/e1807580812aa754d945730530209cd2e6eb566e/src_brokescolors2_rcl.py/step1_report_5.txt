{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract the Roblox security cookie from the Windows registry and send it to a specified Discord webhook, effectively capturing user credentials without consent.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the Windows registry key at 'SOFTWARE\\Roblox\\RobloxStudioBrowser\\roblox.com' to retrieve the '.ROBLOSECURITY' value.",
  "sinks": "The retrieved cookie is sent to an external Discord webhook via an HTTP POST request using the requests library.",
  "flows": "The code reads the registry value (.ROBLOSECURITY) as a source, extracts the cookie, and then transmits it directly to the webhook, forming a source-to-sink flow.",
  "anomalies": "The script is structured explicitly to harvest user cookies stealthily; it uses try-except blocks to silently fail, and the purpose indicated by comments suggests malicious intent. It does not verify user consent or provide transparency.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and defines a webhook URL for data exfiltration. The 'init' function opens a specific registry key associated with Roblox Studio and enumerates its values to find '.ROBLOSECURITY'. If found, it returns this value. In the main block, it attempts to parse and extract the cookie from the returned data, then sends it to the provided webhook. The code is designed solely for malicious data theft, with no legitimate functionality or user interaction. It operates stealthily by catching exceptions silently, which could conceal failures. Overall, the code's intent is to steal Roblox cookies and exfiltrate them.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, intended to steal Roblox security cookies and send them to an attacker-controlled webhook. It does not perform any legitimate functions and exhibits typical characteristics of a cookie-stealing malware, with no transparency or user consent. Its design is straightforward for malicious purposes, with no obfuscation but clear intent.",
