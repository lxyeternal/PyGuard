  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract the Roblox security cookie from the Windows registry and send it to a specified Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "Registry key 'SOFTWARE\\Roblox\\RobloxStudioBrowser\\roblox.com' in HKEY_CURRENT_USER, specifically reading the '.ROBLOSECURITY' value.",
  "sinks": "Sending data via requests.post to a Discord webhook URL with the extracted cookie embedded in the message payload.",
  "flows": "The code reads the Roblox cookie from the registry, extracts the cookie value, and then sends it directly to the webhook, forming a source-to-sink data flow.",
  "anomalies": "The script is explicitly designed to access sensitive user data (Roblox cookie) and exfiltrate it without user consent. It lacks any legitimate purpose, obfuscates its intent, and uses broad exception handling that suppresses errors silently.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, including 'requests' for network activity and 'winreg' for registry access. It defines a webhook URL for exfiltration. The 'init' function iterates over registry values to find '.ROBLOSECURITY'. The main execution attempts to retrieve this cookie, extract the cookie string, and send it to the webhook. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscated or complex code structures, but it clearly performs malicious data theft by exfiltrating user credentials. The broad exception handling prevents detection of errors and makes the script more stealthy. All actions are aligned with malicious intent, specifically targeting Roblox user credentials.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious in intent as it exfiltrates a sensitive user credential (Roblox cookie) and sends it to an attacker-controlled Discord webhook. The functionality is straightforward, with no legitimate use case, and it demonstrates clear malicious behavior aimed at compromising user accounts.",
