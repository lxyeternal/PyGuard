  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Input data from external sources, environment variables, user inputs, or network interactions.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variables, or system commands that could leak data or cause harm.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources through processing functions to sinks, potentially leading to malicious actions if untrusted data is involved.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscation, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), hardcoded secrets, suspicious network domains, or unusual import patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed for suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, and malicious behaviors. No code was provided in some reports, correctly resulting in zero scores. Benign scripts showed straightforward data handling with no obfuscation or malicious activity, aligning with low malware and security risk scores. Suspicious reports identified obfuscation and dynamic execution, justifying moderate scores. The scores are consistent with the described anomalies, with higher suspicion appropriately reflected in the obfuscation and malware scores. In cases of uncertainty, scores remain conservative to avoid false positives.",
  "conclusion": "Most reports accurately reflect the security posture of the code. Benign scripts are correctly scored with minimal risk, while suspicious code with obfuscation and dynamic execution is appropriately rated with moderate suspicion. The scores are justified and consistent with the analysis, with potential for slight adjustments if concrete malicious activity is confirmed.",
