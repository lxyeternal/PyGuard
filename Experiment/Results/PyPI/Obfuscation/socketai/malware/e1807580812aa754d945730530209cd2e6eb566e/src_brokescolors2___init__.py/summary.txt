  "conclusion": "Most reports accurately reflect the security posture of the code. Benign scripts are correctly scored with minimal risk, while suspicious code with obfuscation and dynamic execution is appropriately rated with moderate suspicion. The scores are justified and consistent with the analysis, with potential for slight adjustments if concrete malicious activity is confirmed."
