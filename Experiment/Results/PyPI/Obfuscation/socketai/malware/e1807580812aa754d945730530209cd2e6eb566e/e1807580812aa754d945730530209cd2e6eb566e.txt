      "conclusion": "Most reports accurately reflect the security posture of the code. Benign scripts are correctly scored with minimal risk, while suspicious code with obfuscation and dynamic execution is appropriately rated with moderate suspicion. The scores are justified and consistent with the analysis, with potential for slight adjustments if concrete malicious activity is confirmed."

      "conclusion": "The code is a clear, straightforward credential-stealing malware targeting Roblox users. It exfiltrates sensitive data silently and without user consent. The activity warrants maximum malware and security risk scores. The code is not obfuscated, and the malicious intent is explicit. The reports accurately assess the severity, and no adjustments are necessary."
