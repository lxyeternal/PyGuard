  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script using setuptools, reading README.md for description, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file; static package metadata; no untrusted input or dynamic data.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "N/A; static setup configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Package name 'bea9hkxigbyxp6xo' appears obfuscated or randomly generated; module 'aryi' in 'src' directory; no suspicious code or behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with no dynamic execution, network activity, or malicious code. The unusual package name suggests obfuscation but does not indicate malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code. The high obfuscation scores in some reports are justified by the package name's randomness, but no actual malicious behavior is present. Scores for malware are correctly zero; obfuscation scores could be slightly moderated but are acceptable; security risk scores are low, reflecting the benign code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with an obfuscated package name that raises suspicion but shows no malicious activity. All reports are accurate; malware score is 0, obfuscation is moderate (~0.5-0.7), and security risk is minimal (~0.1). Slightly lowering obfuscation scores in some reports could improve alignment, but overall, the assessments are appropriate.",
