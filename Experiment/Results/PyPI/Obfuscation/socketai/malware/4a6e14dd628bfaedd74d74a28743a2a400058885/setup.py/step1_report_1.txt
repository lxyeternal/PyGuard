{
  "purpose": "To set up a Python package distribution with specified metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description; static setup parameters for package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or execution of untrusted input are present.",
  "flows": "The only data flow is reading a static README file; no data flows from external untrusted sources to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "Package name 'bea9hkxigbyxp6xo' appears random and potentially obfuscated; module 'aryi' and directory 'src' are standard. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a typical setup operation for a Python package, importing 'setuptools', reading a README file for description, and calling 'setup()' with static metadata and a dependency on 'requests'. The package name looks unusual but not inherently malicious. No code injection, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is detected. The code is straightforward and aligns with standard packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with an unusual package name. No malicious behavior or security issues are detected. It appears benign and intended solely for packaging purposes.",
