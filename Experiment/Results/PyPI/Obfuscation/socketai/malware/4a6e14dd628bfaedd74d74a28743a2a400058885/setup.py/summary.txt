  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with an obfuscated package name that raises suspicion but shows no malicious activity. All reports are accurate; malware score is 0, obfuscation is moderate (~0.5-0.7), and security risk is minimal (~0.1). Slightly lowering obfuscation scores in some reports could improve alignment, but overall, the assessments are appropriate."
