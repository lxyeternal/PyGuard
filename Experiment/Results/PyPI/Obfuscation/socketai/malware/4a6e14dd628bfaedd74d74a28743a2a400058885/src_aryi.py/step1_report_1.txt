{
  "purpose": "Obfuscated or protected code likely intended for code security or license enforcement, potentially using PyArmor.",
  "sources": "__pyarmor__, __name__, __file__, and the bytecode blob passed as arguments to __pyarmor__",
  "sinks": "No clear data sinks or network connections; no evidence of data leaks or untrusted data processing",
  "flows": "Input sources (__pyarmor__, __name__, __file__, bytecode) are used within __pyarmor__ call; no data flow to external effects or untrusted sinks detected",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a large obfuscated byte string and usage of __pyarmor__, which is often used for licensing or code obfuscation. No other suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious actions identified.",
  "analysis": "The code wraps a byte sequence with __pyarmor__, a legitimate tool for code obfuscation and licensing enforcement. The byte string appears to be obfuscated or encrypted code data. There are no network connections, no dynamic code execution detected outside the standard PyArmor protection, and no hardcoded credentials or malicious payloads. The structure indicates intentional code protection, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is likely a protected or obfuscated script using PyArmor, with no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. It appears to be standard obfuscation, not malware.",
