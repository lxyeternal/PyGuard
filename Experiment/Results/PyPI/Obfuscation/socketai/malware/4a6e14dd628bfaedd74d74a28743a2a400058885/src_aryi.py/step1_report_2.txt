  "raw_response": "{\n  \"purpose\": \"Obfuscated code likely designed to conceal malicious or unauthorized behavior, potentially to bypass security detection or perform hidden actions.\",\n  \"sources\": \"The code reads environment variables, potentially network resources, and executes dynamic or reflective operations using obfuscation techniques.\",\n  \"sinks\": \"Potentially dangerous operations include dynamic code execution, network communication, or data exfiltration via obscured means. The code may connect to remote servers or perform code injection.\",\n  \"flows\": \"Obfuscated data (b'\\x50\\x59\\x41\\x52\\x4d\\x4f\\x52...') is decoded or decrypted, then possibly executed or transmitted, indicating a source-to-sink flow involving deobfuscation and execution steps.\",\n  \"anomalies\": \"Use of obfuscation with bytecode-like data, potential dynamic evaluation functions, and lack of clear functional logic are suspicious. The presence of encrypted or encoded payloads and the use of an internal '__pyarmor__' function suggest concealment.\",\n  \"analysis\": \"The code begins with a call to '__pyarmor__' passing a byte string, which appears to be encrypted or obfuscated data. The data likely represents a payload or code that is decrypted or decoded at runtime. The complexity and byte-level encoding strongly suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent. There are no straightforward imports or straightforward logic, indicating use of obfuscation techniques common in malware. The data might be decrypted into executable code, network addresses, or payloads, which would then be executed or transmitted. This pattern is typical of malware trying to evade static analysis by hiding its true nature until runtime.\",\n  \"conclusion\": \"The code is highly obfuscated, employs techniques to hide its true behavior, and likely includes malicious payloads. It could be used for covertly executing harmful operations such as code injection, remote communication, or data theft. Due to heavy obfuscation and encryption, the precise nature cannot be fully determined statically, but suspicion is high.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.9,\n  \"obfuscated\": 1,\n  \"malware\": 0.75,\n  \"securityRisk\": 0.75\n}",
