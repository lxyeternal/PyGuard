  "conclusion": "The code exhibits covert data exfiltration behavior during package setup, with obfuscation to hide intent. While no active payloads or system damage are evident, the privacy-invasive actions classify it as highly suspicious and potentially malicious. The assigned scores are appropriate, and the package should be treated with caution or removed from repositories."
