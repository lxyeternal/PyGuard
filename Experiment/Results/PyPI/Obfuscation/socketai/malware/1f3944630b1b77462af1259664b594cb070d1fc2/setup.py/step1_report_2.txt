{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package with some custom installation behavior that collects system and network information and sends it to an external URL.",
  "sources": "Requests to 'https://api.ipify.org' for public IP; reading the current script file's path; environment data from 'os.uname()'; network request to 'https://kotko.org' with encoded data.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external domains ('https://kotko.org') with encoded data; writing to a local file 'pocbykotko.txt'.",
  "flows": "System info and external IP obtained from requests; path and system data are encoded and sent via a GET request to 'kotko.org'; data is stored locally in 'pocbykotko.txt'.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and class names; the 'atexit' handler performs network requests and writes to a local file; base64 encoding and data exfiltration are hidden within installation process; unsolicited network connections; writing a proof statement 'proof bug by kotko'.",
  "analysis": "The script registers a function to execute upon program exit, which collects the machine's public IP, system hostname, and script path, encodes this data, and sends it to an external domain. Additionally, it writes a proof statement to a local file. The obfuscated naming, combined with data exfiltration during install, is suspicious. No explicit malicious payload like code execution, backdoors, or destructive actions are evident, but the data collection and exfiltration behaviors are concerning and resemble data harvesting potentially used maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated and suspicious data collection and exfiltration routines, executed during package installation or script exit, which could be used for malicious surveillance or tracking. While no direct harmful actions like system damage are present, the malicious intent is highly likely due to covert data transmission and hidden operations.",
