{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be setting up a Python package with additional runtime behavior during installation, including network requests and file operations.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from environment (os.uname()), network responses (requests.get to 'https://api.ipify.org' and 'https://kotko.org'), and the local filesystem (reading README.md and writing to 'pocbykotko.txt').",
  "sinks": "Network requests to external domains ('https://kotko.org' and 'https://api.ipify.org'), writing to local file ('pocbykotko.txt'), and possibly leaking collected data via network requests.",
  "flows": "The code fetches the public IP and hostname, encodes this data in base64, and sends it via an HTTP GET request to 'https://kotko.org'. It also writes a proof message to a local file during package installation.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs network requests during package installation, collects system information (public IP and hostname), encodes and transmits this data without clear user consent, and writes a proof message into a file. These behaviors are unusual and could be used for data exfiltration or tracking.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple libraries and defines a setup configuration for a Python package. During installation, via a custom class, it registers a function that executes at exit. This function writes a message to a local file and then gathers system information: external IP address, hostname, and current script path. It encodes this data in base64 and sends it to an external domain ('kotko.org') using an HTTP GET request. This behavior resembles data collection or potential exfiltration. No explicit malicious actions like file damage, reverse shells, or cryptocurrency mining are present, but the data transmission without user awareness is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits potentially malicious behavior by collecting system data and transmitting it to an external domain during package installation. This could be used for tracking, surveillance, or data exfiltration. The package's core functionality appears benign, but the hidden network activity warrants caution.",
