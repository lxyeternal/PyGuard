{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, with additional functions that perform network requests, write to a file, and gather system information.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from environment variables, the file system, and makes network requests to external domains ('https://api.ipify.org' and 'https://kotko.org'). It also reads the current file's directory and system information.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to external domains, writing to a file ('pocbykotko.txt'), and sending data via GET requests with encoded system info.",
  "flows": "Input from environment variables, system info, and network responses are gathered, encoded (base64), and then sent via HTTP GET requests to external servers. File writes occur during cleanup registered in the class destructor.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs network requests to external servers, encodes system information, and writes a proof message to a file during program exit. The requests to 'https://kotko.org' include encoded system info, which could be used for tracking or exfiltration. The network request to 'https://api.ipify.org' retrieves public IP, which is common but combined with other data may be suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script is a setup configuration that, upon installation, registers a function to run at program exit. This function collects system information and the public IP address, encodes this data in base64, and sends it to an external domain. It also writes a proof message to a local file. The external network activity, especially during package installation, combined with data collection and transmission, is suspicious. While some of this may be for benign telemetry, it resembles data exfiltration techniques. The code does not perform malicious system modifications, but its behavior is potentially privacy-invasive and could be used for malicious tracking or data theft.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains network activity that collects system info and transmits it externally, coupled with file writing at program exit. Although it is embedded within a setup script, these actions could be used maliciously for tracking or exfiltration of environment details. The overall risk is moderate, given the unprompted external data transfer during package setup.",
