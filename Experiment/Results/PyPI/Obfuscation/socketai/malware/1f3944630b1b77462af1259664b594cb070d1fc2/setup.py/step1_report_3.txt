{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be a setup configuration for a Python package with embedded malicious behavior, including data exfiltration and system information gathering.",
  "sources": "Requests to external URLs (https://api.ipify.org and https://kotko.org), reading the current file path, and reading system information via os.uname().",
  "sinks": "Requests to external domains with encoded and possibly exfiltrated data, writing to a file ('pocbykotko.txt'), and fetching system info for exfiltration.",
  "flows": "The code gathers system and IP information, encodes it, and sends it via HTTP GET requests to external domains, potentially leaking sensitive data without user consent.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names, dynamic data encoding, requests to obscure external domains, writing proof-of-concept text 'proof bug by kotko', and gathering system info in a hidden manner.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a setup script for a Python package but contains embedded malicious behavior. It registers a function with atexit that, upon program exit, writes a message to a file and exfiltrates system info and external IP address to an external URL. It encodes data in base64 before sending, which can obscure malicious intent. The external URL 'https://kotko.org' is suspicious and likely used for data exfiltration. The code does not seem to perform any benign setup tasks that justify this activity, indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, intended to exfiltrate system information and IP addresses covertly during package installation or script execution. It uses obfuscated variables and encodes data to evade detection. Overall, it should be considered malicious with high security risk.",
