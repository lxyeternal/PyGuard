{
  "purpose": "The code registers an atexit function that, upon program exit, writes to a local file ('pocbykotko.txt') and performs network requests to external URLs ('https://api.ipify.org' and 'https://kotko.org'). It collects system info: external IP, hostname, and script path, encodes this data in base64, and sends it via a GET request, indicating covert data exfiltration during package installation.",
  "sources": "Requests to 'https://api.ipify.org' and 'https://kotko.org', reading system info (IP, hostname, script path), and writing to 'pocbykotko.txt'.",
  "sinks": "Network requests transmitting encoded system info to external domains, writing proof message to local file.",
  "flows": "Source: system info collection and encoding -> Sink: external GET request to 'kotko.org' with encoded data; also, source: writing to local file -> sink: file system.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, network activity during package setup, data encoding and transmission without user consent, writing proof message during install.",
  "analysis": "The code registers an exit handler that performs covert data collection—IP address, hostname, script path—encodes this info, and transmits it to an external server during package installation. The use of obfuscated variable names and encoding techniques suggests an attempt to hide malicious intent. No destructive payloads or remote code execution are present, but the behavior aligns with data exfiltration and privacy invasion. The external requests and file writes are unusual during setup, indicating suspicious activity. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.7-0.9, obfuscated ~0.8, security risk ~0.8) are justified given the covert nature of data collection and exfiltration, which pose significant privacy and security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits covert data exfiltration behavior during package setup, with obfuscation to hide intent. While no active payloads or system damage are evident, the privacy-invasive actions classify it as highly suspicious and potentially malicious. The assigned scores are appropriate, and the package should be treated with caution or removed from repositories.",
