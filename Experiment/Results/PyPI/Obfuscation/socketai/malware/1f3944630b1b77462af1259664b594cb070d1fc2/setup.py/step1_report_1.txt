{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be setting up a Python package with additional side effects during installation, including network requests and file operations.",
  "sources": "Requests to external URLs (https://api.ipify.org and https://kotko.org), reading environment and system info (os.uname()), reading the current file's path, and writing to a local file (pocbykotko.txt).",
  "sinks": "Network requests to external domains with data that includes system information encoded in base64. File writing to 'pocbykotko.txt'.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom install class registers a function that, upon program exit, writes to a file, performs network requests, collects system info, encodes data, and makes HTTP GET requests with the collected data as URL parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes: writing to a file during install, collecting and sending system and IP info to an external domain, encoding system data in base64, and executing network requests with potentially sensitive data. Use of obscure variable names and the function registering a network operation on exit suggests obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code registers a cleanup function that executes upon program termination. This function gathers the system's IP address, hostname, and path, encodes this info, and then sends it via a GET request to an external domain ('kotko.org'). It also writes a message to a local file ('pocbykotko.txt'). The collected data could be used for fingerprinting or exfiltration. The presence of obfuscated variable names and network operations triggered during package installation is suspicious, indicating possible malicious intent or privacy invasion. No use of malicious payloads like remote code execution or data theft from environment variables is directly observed, but the behavior aligns with data exfiltration tactics.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains suspicious behavior involving system info collection, encoding, and transmission to an external server during installation. It also writes a proof message to a local file. While it does not contain clear malware like system damage or remote code execution, the data exfiltration behavior is a security concern. Overall, the code is likely malicious or privacy-invasive.",
