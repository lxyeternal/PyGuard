{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information such as OS details, hostname, username, public IP, and current directory during package installation, then exfiltrates this data to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL.",
  "sources": "os.popen() calls to retrieve system info, requests.get() for public IP, os.getcwd() for current directory, and os.popen('whoami') and 'hostname' commands for user info.",
  "sinks": "requests.post() sending the formatted JSON payload containing collected data to the specified Slack webhook URL.",
  "flows": "System commands (sources) gather data → data is formatted into JSON string → requests.post() (sink) transmits data to external webhook.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names, data collection during setup without user consent, hardcoded webhook URL, silent exfiltration of sensitive info, platform-specific command execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a setup script that, during installation, gathers detailed system information across platforms and sends it to an external server via a hardcoded webhook. It employs obfuscation to hide its intent and executes commands like 'uname', 'ifconfig', 'systeminfo', 'ipconfig', 'whoami', and 'hostname' to collect OS and user data. The data is formatted into a JSON payload and transmitted silently during package installation, indicating covert data exfiltration. The use of external requests and obfuscated identifiers strongly suggests malicious intent focused on privacy invasion and data theft. The code does not perform destructive actions but acts as a stealthy information gatherer, which qualifies as malicious behavior in a security context.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a covert data exfiltration tool embedded within a setup process, with obfuscation and hardcoded webhooks indicating malicious intent. It should be classified as malware with high severity due to privacy invasion and potential security risks.",
