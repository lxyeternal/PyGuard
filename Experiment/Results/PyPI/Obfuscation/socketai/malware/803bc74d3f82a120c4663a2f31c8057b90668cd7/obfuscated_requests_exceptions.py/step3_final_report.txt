  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for HTTP request handling with superficial obfuscation.",
  "sources": "Class attribute assignments with random string values, class inheritance, and attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data flows, no external communication, no input/output handling, no dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "None; the code only defines classes and static attributes.",
  "anomalies": "Superficial obfuscation via random attribute names and string values that serve no functional purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for various HTTP-related exceptions, with attributes containing random strings. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or dynamic code execution. The obfuscation appears superficial, likely intended to hinder straightforward analysis but not malicious. The structure aligns with standard exception hierarchies, and no external or network activity is present. Scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscation: ~0.7-0.8, risk: ~0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of exception class definitions with superficial obfuscation. There are no signs of malware, malicious payloads, or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation does not indicate malicious intent but warrants awareness. Overall, the code poses minimal security risk.",
