{
  "purpose": "This code defines various custom exception classes for handling HTTP and request-related errors in a networking library, likely used for HTTP requests and responses.",
  "sources": "The code reads class definitions, attribute assignments, and inheritance declarations. It does not read external data or input sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no clear sink points for untrusted data that could lead to data leaks, code execution, or malicious activity. The class attributes are simple strings with no apparent malicious intent.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code solely defines exception classes and constants.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated-looking variable names (e.g., 'SPCdilzNlpRVjtcOBcuafptQZJUjLSHR', 'vLMneZCRDKqGPaOgUBxkTyPKjvYnZxiI') assigned to seemingly random strings. These appear to be placeholder or obfuscation techniques rather than malicious code. No dynamic code execution, external calls, or hidden backdoors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code only defines exception classes for HTTP-related errors, with some classes containing obfuscated class attributes assigned to arbitrary strings. The class structures and inheritance are standard for a request handling library, and no code injection, network activity, or malicious behavior is detected. The obfuscation appears to serve no functional purpose other than possibly making analysis harder, but it does not seem to impact security or introduce malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a standard set of custom exception definitions for an HTTP request library, with obfuscated attribute names. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. The obfuscation seems superficial and does not indicate malicious intent.",
