{
  "purpose": "The script retrieves and prints the location of the certificate bundle used by the 'certifi' library.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'where' function from the 'certifi' library, which internally reads its configuration to locate certificate files.",
  "sinks": "The printed output could potentially be read or captured, but there are no direct data sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Input: Import of 'where' from 'certifi' -> Execution of 'print(where())' -> Output of certificate path.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code performs a straightforward operation with no suspicious logic, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a well-known security library 'certifi' and calls its 'where' function to output the path to CA certificates. There is no input from untrusted sources, no data processing, no network activity, and no sensitive information handling beyond reading a file path. The code's simplicity and the use of standard, reputable library functions indicate benign intent. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a simple utility to display the location of the 'certifi' CA bundle. It poses no security risk or malicious intent based on this analysis.",
