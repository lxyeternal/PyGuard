{
  "purpose": "To print the file path of the trusted certificate bundle provided by the 'certifi' package.",
  "sources": "The 'where' function imported from the 'certifi' library.",
  "sinks": "The 'print' statement outputs data to the console; no untrusted data flow or external communication present.",
  "flows": "The 'where' function provides a trusted file path which is then printed; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior observed. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'where' from 'certifi', which is a standard library for verifying SSL certificates. It then prints the path to the trusted CA bundle. There are no input sources other than the library call, no data manipulation, no external network activity, or suspicious code constructs. The purpose appears to be a simple utility for retrieving and displaying the certifi certificate path. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign script that outputs the certifi certificate bundle path. No malicious behavior, malicious intent, or security risks detected.",
