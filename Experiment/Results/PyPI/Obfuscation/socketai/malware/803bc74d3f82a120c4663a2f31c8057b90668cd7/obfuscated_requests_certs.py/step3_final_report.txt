  "purpose": "Retrieve and print the file path to the SSL CA bundle provided by the 'certifi' library.",
  "sources": "Importing 'where' from 'certifi' and calling it to get the CA bundle path.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only outputs a trusted file path without external data or network communication.",
  "flows": "Source: 'where()' function call; Sink: 'print()' output to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of a standard library function with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a trusted function from 'certifi' and prints its output. It involves no untrusted input, external communication, or data manipulation. The purpose is benign: displaying the location of the CA bundle. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0) are consistent with the code's behavior. The confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility that outputs the trusted CA bundle path. It poses no security risks, malware, or obfuscation concerns. The reports and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
