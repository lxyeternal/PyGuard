{
  "purpose": "The code prints the filesystem path to the certificate bundle used by the 'certifi' library.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'where' function from the 'certifi' library.",
  "sinks": "The 'print' function outputs data to standard output.",
  "flows": "The 'where()' function retrieves certificate path -> output via 'print' to the console.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward usage of a standard library function with no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'where' from 'certifi' and prints its output when executed. It does not accept user input, connect to networks, or perform any actions beyond printing a static file path. There is no code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior present. The use of 'certifi' is standard for SSL certificate verification purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and performs a simple, safe operation without any signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
