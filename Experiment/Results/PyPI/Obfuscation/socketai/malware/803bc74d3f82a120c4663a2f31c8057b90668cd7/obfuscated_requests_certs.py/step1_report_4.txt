{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to print the path to the CA bundle used by the 'certifi' package, likely for verifying SSL certificates.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input data; it only imports a function and executes a print statement.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or leaked; the code only outputs a static value obtained from an imported library.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow exists, as the code simply prints a static value from a trusted library.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and standard for obtaining CA bundle location.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'where' function from 'certifi', then prints its result when executed. This is a common, benign operation to locate SSL certificate authorities. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or obfuscated code. The use of 'certifi' is standard for SSL-related operations. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and benign, intended to output the location of the CA bundle used for SSL verification. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
