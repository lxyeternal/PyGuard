{
  "purpose": "This code sets up environment compatibility, manages optional dependencies, and imports standard modules for URL parsing, JSON handling, and cookies, serving as a configuration or initialization segment.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules like chardet/charset_normalizer, simplejson/json, sys.version_info, and standard libraries for URL parsing, JSON, and cookies.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external communication.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code only imports modules and defines variables without data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and compatibility setup with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard environment setup: it manages optional dependencies with fallbacks, checks Python version for compatibility, and defines type aliases for cross-version support. It imports modules for URL parsing, JSON handling, and cookies. There are no functions, data processing, external data handling, or network operations. The code is clear, readable, and uses common practices, indicating no malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign setup script for environment compatibility and dependency management. It contains no malicious or obfuscated code, and the security risk is minimal. The scores in the reports are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0. and a very low security risk score (~0.05). No adjustments are necessary.",
