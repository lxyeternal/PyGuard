  "purpose": "Import necessary modules and handle compatibility for different Python versions and optional dependencies.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules such as chardet/charset_normalizer, sys, simplejson/json, collections, http, io, urllib.parse, urllib.request.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that process untrusted data or execute untrusted code are present.",
  "flows": "N/A - the code primarily loads modules and sets up environment, no data flow from source to sink identified.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional import for chardet, fallback to charset_normalizer; dynamic import for simplejson/json; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment setup, importing various modules for character detection, JSON handling, HTTP, URL parsing, and compatibility. It includes fallbacks for missing modules and defines some type aliases. No user input is read, no data is transmitted or processed insecurely, and there are no code injections or obfuscated code segments. All operations are standard library imports and compatibility adjustments. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup for a Python package, handling compatibility and optional dependencies without any malicious intent. No security risks or malicious behaviors are detected.",
