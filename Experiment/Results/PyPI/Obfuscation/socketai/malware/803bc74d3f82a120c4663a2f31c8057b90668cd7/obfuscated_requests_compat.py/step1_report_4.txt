{
  "purpose": "This code primarily sets up imports and compatibility checks for different Python versions, and imports various modules for handling JSON, URL parsing, and cookies.",
  "sources": "Input sources include module imports and system version information (sys.version_info).",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks such as network connections, file writes, or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows, as the code only performs import statements and variable initializations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code uses standard modules and techniques for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code handles optional imports for 'chardet' and 'simplejson', with fallback mechanisms. It checks Python version to set compatibility flags and defines some type aliases. All operations are standard and do not perform any data processing or external communication. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. The code appears to be boilerplate setup code common in many Python projects, with no evidence of obfuscated or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup for handling compatibility across Python versions and importing necessary modules. There are no signs of malicious activity, data leaks, or malicious behavior. It appears safe and typical for a Python project.",
