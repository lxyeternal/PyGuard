{
  "purpose": "The code performs dependency validation, version compatibility checks, SSL support injection, and environment setup for the library.",
  "sources": "Reads version strings from imported modules, environment variables, and configuration flags.",
  "sinks": "Raises assertions and warnings; no data flows to external systems or network activities.",
  "flows": "Version strings → validation assertions → warnings or exceptions; environment checks → potential cryptography injection.",
  "anomalies": "Use of assertions for version validation, which could cause abrupt termination if conditions are unmet; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard dependency and environment validation, including version checks and SSL support injection. It uses assertions for validation, which are common but could disrupt operation if conditions fail. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The cryptography support injection is a typical SSL support measure. Warnings are appropriately used for dependency issues. No obfuscation or malicious payloads are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical dependency validation and environment setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is consistent with standard practices in Python libraries like urllib3 or requests. The low risk score reflects its benign nature, with no malware or obfuscation detected.",
