{
  "purpose": "The code provides classes and functions related to constructing, preparing, sending, and handling HTTP requests and responses using the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Data is read from request parameters such as URL, headers, files, data, json, cookies, and hooks; response content and headers; and internal attributes like self.reason and self.status_code.",
  "sinks": "Potential untrusted data flows include: response content decoding, error message construction, and header parsing. However, these are standard functionalities. No direct sinks for malicious data are identified.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into request objects, which generate network requests, and responses which are processed to determine status, decode content, or raise errors. No suspicious source-to-sink paths are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard implementation of HTTP request/response handling; no unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic are present. The code is verbose but typical for such modules.",
  "analysis": "The module defines classes and methods for request preparation, response handling, error checking, and link parsing. All functionalities are typical and do not involve any suspicious dynamic code execution, external command calls, or data exfiltration mechanisms. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. The code performs expected HTTP operations with proper error handling. No signs of obfuscation or malware patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard part of the requests library, responsible for handling HTTP requests and responses. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain attacks. It appears safe based on this review.",
