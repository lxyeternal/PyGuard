  "purpose": "Standard implementation of request preparation, response handling, error management, and link parsing within the requests library.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as URL, headers, data, files, JSON payload, cookies, and response content.",
  "sinks": "Request sending, error raising, response content decoding, and header parsing.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from parameters to request construction, response processing, and error handling functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, well-documented segment of the requests library, handling HTTP request/response workflows. No malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or security flaws are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign, standard nature of the code. No anomalies or signs of sabotage are observed, and the code aligns with best practices for such a library component.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriate and justified, indicating a very low security risk. No further action is necessary.",
