{
  "purpose": "The module provides classes and functions for constructing, preparing, sending, and handling HTTP requests and responses using the Requests library in Python.",
  "sources": "Code reads from standard input parameters such as url, headers, files, data, json, params, auth, cookies, hooks, and response attributes like reason, status_code, headers, and raw data.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include request sending (s.send()), response processing (e.g., decoding content, raising exceptions), and header parsing. However, there are no direct untrusted data sinks that would indicate malicious data exfiltration or command execution.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into request construction and preparation; response content is processed for decoding and error handling; headers are parsed for links; exceptions are raised based on response status. No external or untrusted data flows into potentially malicious sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or unusual code structures are present. The code appears to be standard implementation of HTTP request/response handling with no signs of malicious tampering.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical part of the Requests library, handling request preparation, response decoding, link parsing, and error raising. It reads data from user-provided inputs like URLs, headers, and response attributes. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are detected. The functions are standard and do not perform any external network operations or system modifications. The response processing and error handling are standard, with no signs of data leakage or code injection. Overall, the code appears to be legitimate, standard library code, with no indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of HTTP request and response handling, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It serves its purpose within the Requests library without any signs of sabotage or malware.",
