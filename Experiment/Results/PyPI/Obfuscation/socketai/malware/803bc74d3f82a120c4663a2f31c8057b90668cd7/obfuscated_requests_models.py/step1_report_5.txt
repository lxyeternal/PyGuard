{
  "purpose": "This module provides core classes and functions for constructing, preparing, and handling HTTP requests and responses using the Requests library.",
  "sources": "User inputs include URL, headers, data, json, params, auth, cookies, hooks, and response attributes like reason, status_code, and headers.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include request data (headers, data, json, files), response content (content, text, raw), and error messages in raise_for_status().",
  "flows": "Data flows from user inputs (sources) into request construction; response data flows from server back to user through response attributes and methods.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code structures observed. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily implements standard request and response handling with proper error checking. It processes headers, response content, and status codes with typical logic. No external or untrusted data manipulation appears suspicious. No code injection points, insecure environment variable handling, or malicious behaviors such as network exfiltration are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard, well-structured implementation of HTTP request/response handling in the Requests library. No malicious or sabotage indicators detected. It functions as expected for a core HTTP client module.",
