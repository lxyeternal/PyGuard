  "purpose": "Cookie management utilities including classes for cookie jars, mock request/response objects, and functions for creating, copying, merging, and removing cookies.",
  "sources": "Request headers, cookie jar data, and cookie attributes such as name, value, domain, and path.",
  "sinks": "Cookie jar modifications, request header updates, and cookie extraction functions.",
  "flows": "Input data from request headers or cookie dictionaries flow into cookie objects and are stored or retrieved from cookie jars.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of an obfuscated attribute name 'KPvcrNnPfvSuaKOrOHDIafiebcNrsrDb' in multiple classes, and fallback threading import; these are unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard cookie utility module with classes and functions for handling cookies, mocking requests/responses, and managing cookie jars. The obfuscated attribute appears to be a stylistic or internal identifier, not indicative of malicious intent. No network activity, data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, risk=0.2, obfuscated=0.2-0.3) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The minor obfuscation does not impact security or functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, utility-focused, and free of malicious behavior. The obfuscated attribute is likely stylistic. The low malware and risk scores are justified. No supply chain or security concerns are evident.",
