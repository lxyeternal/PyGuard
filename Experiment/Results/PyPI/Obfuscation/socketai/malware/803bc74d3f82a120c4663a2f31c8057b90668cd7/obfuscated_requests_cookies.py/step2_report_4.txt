  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the code's behavior, consistency of scores, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a cookie utility with some obfuscated attribute names; no malicious code detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.2, obfuscated=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The obfuscated attribute ('KPvcrNnPfvSuaKOrOHDIafiebcNrsrDb') appears to be a class attribute with an obscure name, but it’s just a string constant, not indicative of malicious intent.\n- No network activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- The code is standard for cookie management.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores seem reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on utility functions, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.2, obfuscated=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Same obfuscated attribute as above, likely just a placeholder or internal identifier.\n- No suspicious behavior, no network calls, no data leaks.\n- The code is standard.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Cookie management utilities with some obfuscation; no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.2, obfuscated=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The presence of a fallback threading import and obfuscated attribute name ('KPvcrNnPfvSuaKOrOHDIafiebcNrsrDb') is noted, but these are not malicious.\n- Functions operate on external data, with no code injection or network activity.\n- No malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Cookie utilities with obfuscated attribute name; standard operations.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.2, obfuscated=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Similar observations: no malicious code, just obfuscation.\n- No network activity or backdoors.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Cookie handling functions, obfuscated attribute, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.2, obfuscated=0.3, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Slightly higher obfuscation score (0.3) is justified given the obfuscated attribute name.\n- No malware or suspicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports are 0, which aligns with the analysis; no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Slightly varies (0.2 to 0.3), justified by the presence of obfuscated attribute names.\n- **Risk Score:** Uniformly low (0.2), consistent with standard utility code.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** ~0.2 — minor obfuscation, not malicious.\n- **Risk:** ~0.2 — low, utility-level code.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are consistent, and the scores are justified. The code appears to be a standard cookie management utility with minor obfuscation, not malicious or dangerous in nature.\n\n**Recommendation:** No significant changes to scores. The obfuscation should be noted but does not elevate risk or malware concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:**  \n- The presence of obfuscated attribute names is unusual but not inherently malicious.\n- No supply chain or malicious activity is evident from the code snippets and reports provided.",
