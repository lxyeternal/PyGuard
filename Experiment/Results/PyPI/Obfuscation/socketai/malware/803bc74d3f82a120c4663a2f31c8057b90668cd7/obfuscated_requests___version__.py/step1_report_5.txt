  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'requests' Python library.",
  "sources": "Constants assigned at the module level (__title__, __description__, __url__, __version__, __build__, __author__, __author_email__, __license__, __copyright__, __cake__).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, input/output, or external system interactions present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only sets static string values.",
  "anomalies": "Use of Unicode emojis in __cake__ may be unconventional but not suspicious or malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of module-level string assignments defining metadata about the package. No functions, I/O, network calls, or data processing are present. No hardcoded credentials, environment variable usage, or external interactions are observed. The Unicode emojis are harmless decorative characters. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely metadata definition for the 'requests' package and contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be standard, benign package information.",
