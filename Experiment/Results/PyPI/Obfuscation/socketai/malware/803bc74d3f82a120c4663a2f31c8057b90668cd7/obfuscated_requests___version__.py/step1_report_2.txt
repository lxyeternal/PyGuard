  "purpose": "Define metadata attributes for the 'requests' Python package, including title, description, URL, version, author info, license, and copyright.",
  "sources": "The code assigns string or integer values to module-level variables, which are static data definitions.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flows involving untrusted data or external inputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks exists in this static metadata code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs. The code is straightforward variable assignments.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments that store package metadata information. It contains no input handling, no network operations, and no executable code beyond setting constants. The presence of unicode emojis in __cake__ does not indicate malicious intent. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign metadata for the 'requests' library, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
