  "purpose": "Package metadata declaration for the 'requests' Python library, including version, author, license, and decorative emoji.",
  "sources": "Static variable assignments defining package metadata (__title__, __description__, __url__, __version__, __build__, __author__, __author_email__, __license__, __copyright__, __cake__).",
  "sinks": "None; no external input, data flow, or output operations are present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static assignments with no data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of Unicode emojis (__cake__) as decoration; no malicious or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments containing package metadata. No functions, data processing, external input/output, or dynamic code execution are present. Unicode emojis are used decoratively and do not indicate malicious intent. Multiple reviews confirm the absence of suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious payloads. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign, static nature of the code. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward package metadata with no malicious or security concerns. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's static, informational purpose.",
