{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be a setup/configuration script for a Python package, with some additional code executing on Windows systems to download and execute remote files.",
  "sources": "Reading package version information, reading README.md, reading from environment variables (e.g., sys.version_info), reading from subprocess outputs, reading remote files via requests.get, reading from __version__.py",
  "sinks": "Writing to files ('local_copy.txt', 'local_b.txt'), executing system commands via subprocess.Popen ('move', 'del', 'cmd /c ...'), installing Python packages via pip, executing downloaded files/scripts",
  "flows": "Input data from sys.version_info, __version__.py, README.md, environment variables, and remote URLs flow into conditional checks, file writes, and subprocess commands which execute system-level operations including downloading and executing remote content.",
  "anomalies": "The code downloads content from external IP addresses and executes it via subprocess without validation, which is suspicious. Use of subprocess.Popen to run potentially malicious commands like 'move', 'del', and 'cmd /c' with remote content indicates malicious intent. The code also installs 'requests' dynamically, which is unusual for a setup script and might be a tactic to ensure network capabilities for malicious operations.",
  "analysis": "The script begins as a typical setup configuration, checking Python version and setting up packaging info. However, the critical concern lies in the block conditioned on 'if os.name == 'nt'', which targets Windows. Within this block, the code attempts to read the temp directory path via subprocess, then installs 'requests' if missing. Subsequently, it fetches data from a remote IP address (52.14.229.35) twice, saving content to local files, and moves/executing these files via 'cmd /c' commands. It also performs a 'net session' command to check for admin rights. The remote URLs point to files that could be malicious, and the execution of downloaded content without validation or sandboxing is highly suspicious. The code's purpose seems to be to download and execute remote scripts or files, possibly establishing persistence or remote control, which is characteristic of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains malicious behavior evidenced by downloading and executing remote files without validation, executing system commands that could alter or compromise the host system, and installing dependencies dynamically for potentially malicious purposes. The Windows-specific code appears designed to execute remote payloads, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent.",
