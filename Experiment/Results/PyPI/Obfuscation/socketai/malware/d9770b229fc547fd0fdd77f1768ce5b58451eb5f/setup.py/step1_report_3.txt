  "purpose": "Set up a Python package named 'ts3z6uzf50w3at7g' with specific metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading from import statements, file creation (NamedTemporaryFile), system call (_ssystem), and reading from a URL via urllib.request.urlopen.",
  "sinks": "Execution of code via exec() in the downloaded content, system command execution (_ssystem), reading remote content from a URL.",
  "flows": "The code writes a malicious script to a temporary file, then executes a system command that appears to run an executable (constructed from _eexecutable), but the URL content is fetched and executed directly, indicating potential remote code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Writing a remote payload into a temporary file and immediately executing it via system call; use of exec() on remote content; obfuscated variable names; executing an executable with a manipulated filename.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup and temporary file handling modules. It creates a temporary file and writes a script that fetches code from an external URL and executes it immediately, indicating remote code execution. It then attempts to run a process with a manipulated executable name, possibly to evade detection. The setup call appears normal but is overshadowed by the malicious activity in the preceding code. The use of obfuscated variable names and the immediate execution of remote code are suspicious indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by downloading and executing code from a remote URL, which is a high-risk supply chain attack vector. The setup function is likely a decoy or secondary purpose. Overall, the code demonstrates significant malicious activity and should be considered unsafe.",
