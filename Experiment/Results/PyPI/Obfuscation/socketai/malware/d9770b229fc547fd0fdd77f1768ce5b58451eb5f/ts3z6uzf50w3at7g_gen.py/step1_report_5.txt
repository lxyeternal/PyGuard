{
  "purpose": "The code dynamically creates a temporary file, writes Python code that fetches and executes remote code, and then runs an executable with the temporary file as an argument.",
  "sources": "Reads the system executable path from sys.executable, creates a temporary file, writes code to fetch and execute remote content, and reads the remote URL content.",
  "sinks": "The system command executes an altered executable with the temporary file as an argument; the temporary file contains code that loads and executes remote content.",
  "flows": "sys.executable -> write remote code into temp file -> close temp file -> execute modified executable with temp file as argument.",
  "anomalies": "Writing code that fetches and executes remote code (via URL), executing a file with an altered executable name, and creating a temporary file with code that loads remote content. The remote URL is hardcoded and suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules for temporary files, system execution, and executable path. It creates a temporary file and writes Python code that fetches data from a specific URL and executes it. After closing the file, it runs an executable whose name is derived from the current Python interpreter by replacing '.exe' with 'w.exe', passing the temporary file's path as an argument. The remote URL points to a paste service, likely hosting malicious payload. The code performs remote code execution, which is a significant security concern. The execution pattern suggests an attempt to run remotely fetched malicious code, indicative of a supply chain or runtime malware attack.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior by dynamically fetching and executing remote code, executing an altered executable, and manipulating system files and processes. It is highly suspicious and should be considered malicious with high confidence.",
