  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The reports' scores are generally consistent with the evidence. High suspicion in reports 1 and 3 is justified by obfuscation and malicious indicators. Benign assessments in reports 2 and 4 are appropriate. Overall, the scoring accurately reflects the analyzed code's security posture."
