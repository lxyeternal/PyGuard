  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Dynamic code execution functions (eval, exec), hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, suspicious control flow, input/output data handling.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks via environment variables, network connections, system modifications, or execution of malicious payloads.",
  "flows": "Input sources (e.g., eval, exec, environment variables) leading to code execution, data exfiltration, or system manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation (high obfuscation score), dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, suspicious control flow, lack of comments, and unusual variable usage.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits high obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are common in malicious scripts. Presence of hardcoded credentials and suspicious control flow further increases risk. Benign code lacks obfuscation and suspicious functions. The scores assigned in the reports align with these observations, with higher scores in suspicious cases and low scores in benign cases. Minor score adjustments are suggested to better reflect suspicion levels, especially in reports with notable obfuscation and dynamic code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The reports' scores are generally consistent with the evidence. High suspicion in reports 1 and 3 is justified by obfuscation and malicious indicators. Benign assessments in reports 2 and 4 are appropriate. Overall, the scoring accurately reflects the analyzed code's security posture.",
