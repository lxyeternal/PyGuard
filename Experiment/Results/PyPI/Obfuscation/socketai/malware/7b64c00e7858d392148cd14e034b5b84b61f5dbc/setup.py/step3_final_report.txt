  "purpose": "The code performs data exfiltration during package installation by sending system info to an external URL.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() to send data to 'https://1y05ug5pi97xa0bk2bjhdwp5yw4nsdg2.oastify.com'",
  "flows": "System info collected from sources flows into requests.get() which transmits data externally",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names, network activity during setup, sending data to suspicious external URL",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, during installation, collects hostname, current working directory, and username, then exfiltrates this data via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious URL. The obfuscation of class and method names indicates an attempt to conceal malicious intent. The network activity during setup is atypical for legitimate packages and suggests malicious behavior aimed at covert data collection.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious exfiltration behavior during package installation, with obfuscation and suspicious network activity confirming malicious intent. The activity is consistent with supply chain attack patterns, warranting high malware and security risk scores.",
