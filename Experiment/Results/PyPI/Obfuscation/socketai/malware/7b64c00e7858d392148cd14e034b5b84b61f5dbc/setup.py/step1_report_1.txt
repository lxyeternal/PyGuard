{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom installation process that collects system information and sends it to an external server during package installation.",
  "sources": "Reads system hostname, current working directory, and username via socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), and getpass.getuser().",
  "sinks": "Sends collected system data via HTTP GET request to a suspicious external URL.",
  "flows": "System info is gathered (source), then sent to the external URL via requests.get() (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes transmitting system information to an external server during package install, which is not typical behavior for legitimate packages. The URL is suspicious and likely malicious. The class name is obfuscated, indicating potential malicious intent. The method name is also obfuscated.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class inheriting from setuptools' install. During installation, it collects hostname, current directory, and username, then immediately sends this data to an external server using requests.get(). The URL is suspicious and could be used for tracking or exfiltration. The obfuscated class and method names suggest an attempt to conceal malicious intent. This pattern is typical in malicious Python packages that perform data exfiltration during install.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information to an external server during installation. The obfuscation and network activity raise significant security concerns. The package should be considered malicious or potentially harmful.",
