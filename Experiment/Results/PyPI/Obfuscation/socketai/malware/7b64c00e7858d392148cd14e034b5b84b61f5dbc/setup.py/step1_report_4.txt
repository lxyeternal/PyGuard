{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package with custom installation behavior, including sending system information to an external server during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information such as hostname, current working directory, and username during the install process.",
  "sinks": "It sends collected data via an HTTP GET request to an external URL (https://1y05ug5pi97xa0bk2bjhdwp5yw4nsdg2.oastify.com).",
  "flows": "System info is gathered (source) and then transmitted over the network to an external domain (sink) during installation.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs an unsolicited network request during setup, which is unusual for legitimate package setup scripts. The hostname, username, and working directory are collected without user consent and sent to a suspicious URL. The class and method names appear obfuscated, and the URL is associated with a known OAST (One-shot Attack Service) server used for security testing and tracking, indicating potential malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom install command that, when invoked, collects system information: hostname, current directory, and username. Instead of typical setup behavior, it makes an HTTP GET request to a suspicious URL, potentially exfiltrating user environment data. The code uses obfuscated class and method names, which is often a sign of malicious or covert activity. Sending user and system data without consent is malicious behavior, especially via an external server. The URL is associated with tracking or malicious activities. The code's purpose appears to be covert data collection during package installation, which is suspicious and potentially malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting system info and exfiltrating it to a suspicious external server during package installation. The obfuscation and data exfiltration strongly suggest malicious intent. The package could compromise user privacy and system security.",
