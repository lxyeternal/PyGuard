  "purpose": "Custom installation process that gathers system information and reports it to an external URL during package installation.",

  "sinks": "requests.get() with data sent to external URL",
  "flows": "Collects hostname, current working directory, username -> Sends data to external server via HTTP GET request",
  "anomalies": "Unusual class name, obfuscated method name, external data exfiltration during install process",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that, during execution, collects hostname, current directory, and username. It then makes an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external URL with this information. The code is obfuscated with non-descriptive class and method names, which is suspicious. Data exfiltration during package installation without user consent indicates malicious intent. No other malicious payloads or backdoors are present, but the act of sending system info to an external server is concerning.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs covert data collection and exfiltration during package installation, indicating malicious behavior aimed at user tracking or data theft. The obfuscation and unusual behavior suggest intent to hide this activity. This package should be considered malicious.",
