{
  "purpose": "Custom setup script that collects system information and sends it to an external server during installation.",
  "sources": "Socket hostname, current working directory, username from getpass, data sent via requests.get to an external URL.",
  "sinks": "requests.get call that transmits collected system information to an external server.",
  "flows": "Data collected from hostname, cwd, username flows into the dictionary, which is sent via HTTP GET request to a remote domain.",
  "anomalies": "The code collects and transmits system info during installation without user consent. The external URL appears suspicious and is used solely for data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the 'install' command in setuptools to include a function that gathers system hostname, current directory, and username. It then sends this data to an external domain via an HTTP GET request. This behavior is not typical for a standard setup script and suggests data exfiltration. The URL used is suspicious and likely malicious. The code does not perform any other malicious actions such as file modification or system compromise, but its purpose of unauthorized data collection during package installation indicates malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting system information and transmitting it to an external server during package installation. It appears to be designed for data exfiltration without user consent, indicating a supply chain security risk.",
