{
  "purpose": "Customize the installation process by collecting system information and sending it to an external server.",
  "sources": "The code reads system hostname, current working directory, and username via socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), and getpass.getuser().",
  "sinks": "Data is sent via an HTTP GET request to an external URL ('https://1y05ug5pi97xa0bk2bjhdwp5yw4nsdg2.oastify.com').",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, cwd, username) flows from source functions into a dictionary, then is sent as a parameter in an HTTP GET request to the external server.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a highly obfuscated class and method names, which is unusual. It also sends system data to a suspicious external domain. No other malicious behaviors like code execution or data exfiltration are evident.",
  "analysis": "The script modifies the installation process via a custom 'install' class. During installation, it collects system information—hostname, current directory, and username—and sends this data to an external server. The obfuscated class and method names suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent. The external request could be used for tracking, reconnaissance, or further malicious activity. No code injection, credential theft, or destructive actions are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be designed for tracking or reconnaissance by collecting and exfiltrating system information during package installation. The obfuscation and external communication raise suspicion of malicious intent, though no active malicious actions are confirmed. It is recommended to treat this package with caution.",
