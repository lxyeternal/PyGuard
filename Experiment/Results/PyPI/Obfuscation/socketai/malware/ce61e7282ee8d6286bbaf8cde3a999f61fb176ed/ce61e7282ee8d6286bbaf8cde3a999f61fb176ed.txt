      "conclusion": "Overall, the reports are consistent with their scoring. No confirmed malicious activity is present; the scores are appropriately cautious. Slightly increasing the obfuscated score in Report 5 from 0 to around 0.2–0.3 would better reflect the observed anomalies. The malware scores remain at zero, and risk scores are justified given the potential but unconfirmed suspicious patterns. The assessments are sound and align with the evidence provided."
