  "purpose": "Evaluate supply chain security of the open source dependency by analyzing provided code snippets and reports for malicious behavior, anomalies, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Input parameters, environment variables, data processing functions, network or system calls, variable assignments, imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file operations, system commands, environment variable access, data transmissions.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or inputs flow into processing functions, which may lead to network or system sinks; potential data leaks or malicious actions depend on these flows.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, dynamic code execution, suspicious URL-like strings, inconsistent or unusual code patterns, potential obfuscation, or suspicious imports.",
  "analysis": "All reports without code correctly identify absence of malicious activity, assigning zero scores. Reports with code generally show benign patterns, standard data processing, and no suspicious behavior, with risk scores slightly above zero (0.2) to reflect cautious suspicion. Report 5 notes anomalies like obfuscated variables and dynamic code but lacks confirmed malicious payloads, leading to a low malware score (0) and moderate risk (0.3). The obfuscated score is currently zero across all reports, but given the hints of obfuscation in Report 5, it should be increased slightly to reflect potential obfuscation. Confidence levels are high in benign cases, and the scoring aligns with the evidence. Minor adjustments are recommended for the risk and obfuscated scores in some reports to better match the observed anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "Overall, the reports are consistent with their scoring. No confirmed malicious activity is present; the scores are appropriately cautious. Slightly increasing the obfuscated score in Report 5 from 0 to around 0.2–0.3 would better reflect the observed anomalies. The malware scores remain at zero, and risk scores are justified given the potential but unconfirmed suspicious patterns. The assessments are sound and align with the evidence provided.",
