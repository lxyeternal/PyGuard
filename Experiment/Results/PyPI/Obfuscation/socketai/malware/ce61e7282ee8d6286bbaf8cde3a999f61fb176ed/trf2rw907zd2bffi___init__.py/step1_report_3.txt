  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or computation, but no explicit purpose is clearly defined in the provided code snippet.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'input_data' variable, environment variables (via os.environ), and potentially from external libraries or files if imported or called within the code.",
  "sinks": "Data can flow into print statements, logging functions, or external network connections if present, but no explicit sinks such as network calls or file writes are identified in the snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (variables, environment variables) into functions or processing routines, then potentially to output functions like print or logging. No explicit dangerous flows are identified.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, suspicious imports, or obfuscated code. No unusual or maliciously suspicious behaviors are apparent. The code uses standard Python constructs without signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is simple and utilizes common Python features. It reads input data and processes it through functions or expressions. No malicious patterns such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors are visible. The absence of network activity, secret handling, or destructive operations suggests a benign nature. Lack of complex or obfuscated code supports this conclusion.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks. The code appears to be a benign data processing script with no evidence of malware or security issues.",
