  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some data processing or utility functions, but without specific context or documentation, the exact intent is unclear.",
  "sources": "Data is read from environment variables, input parameters, and potentially from imported modules or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "Data could be sent over network connections, written to files, or used in system commands, but specific sinks are not clearly demonstrated due to lack of executable code in the snippet.",
  "flows": "Untrusted data from environment variables or inputs could flow into functions that process or output data, but explicit flow paths are not clearly outlined in the provided snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code were detected. The code uses standard library functions and typical structures.",
  "analysis": "The code is either incomplete or consists of standard boilerplate without malicious payloads. There are no signs of suspicious activities such as network communications, data exfiltration, or malicious system modifications. Usage of third-party libraries is not inherently suspicious and appears appropriate. No obfuscated or malicious code constructs are present. Without further context, the code appears benign, but the lack of explicit functionality makes definitive conclusions limited.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or significant security risks. The code appears standard and non-malicious, with no suspicious patterns detected.",
  "confidence": 0.7,
  "obfuscated": 0,
