  "conclusion": "The script exhibits suspicious behavior characteristic of malicious payload delivery, including obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during setup. The high obfuscation, stealth, and execution context justify a high malware and security risk score. While absolute certainty requires decoding the payload, current evidence strongly indicates malicious activity."
