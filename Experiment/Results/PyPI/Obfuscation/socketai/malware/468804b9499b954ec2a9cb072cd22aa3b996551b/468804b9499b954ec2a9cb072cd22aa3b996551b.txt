      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious intent, involving stealthy, obfuscated execution of external code based on filesystem state. It should be flagged as malicious or highly suspicious pending further decoding of the PowerShell payload. The high scores are consistent with typical indicators of supply chain malware or backdoors."
