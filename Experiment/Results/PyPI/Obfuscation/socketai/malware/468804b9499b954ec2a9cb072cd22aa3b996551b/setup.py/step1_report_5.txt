{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, intended to define package metadata and perform some pre-installation steps.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the file system (checking if 'tahg' exists) and executes a subprocess command with encoded PowerShell script.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen call executes a PowerShell command that could potentially perform malicious actions, especially given the encoded command and hidden window parameters.",
  "flows": "If 'tahg' does not exist, the script triggers the subprocess which runs a base64-encoded PowerShell command, potentially leading to malicious actions without user awareness.",
  "anomalies": "The use of base64-encoded PowerShell commands, especially with hidden window flags, is suspicious. The encoded string likely contains malicious or obfuscated code. The try-except blocks suppress errors silently, which could hide malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The script first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg'. If absent, it runs a PowerShell command via subprocess with hidden window style. The PowerShell command is encoded in base64, which is a common obfuscation technique for malicious scripts. The setup function defines package metadata, which is standard, but the prior code execution presents a high risk. The try-except blocks hide errors, potentially concealing malicious failures. Overall, the code's structure and obfuscated command strongly suggest malicious intent or a supply chain attack vector.",
  "conclusion": "The script combines legitimate setup code with a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently. This pattern indicates likely malicious behavior aimed at executing hidden payloads during package installation. Due to the encoded command and its context, this code should be considered malicious and dangerous.",
