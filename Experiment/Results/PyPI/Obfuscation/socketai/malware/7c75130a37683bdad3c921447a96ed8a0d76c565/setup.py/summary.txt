  "security_risk": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious intent due to the execution of an obfuscated, encoded PowerShell command during package setup, with silent error handling and concealment tactics. The behavior is characteristic of malicious payload delivery mechanisms, warranting a malware score of 0.8, an obfuscation score of 0.9, and a security risk score of 0.8. While the exact payload is not decoded, the indicators strongly suggest malicious activity, and the package should be treated as potentially harmful."
