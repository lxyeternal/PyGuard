{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom installation command that, during package installation, gathers system information and sends it to a specified external server.",
  "sources": "System calls: socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() to external server with system information as parameters",
  "flows": "System information collected from hostname, current working directory, and username flows to an HTTP GET request to an external domain",
  "anomalies": "The code transmits system details to an external server during installation without user consent; the server URL appears suspicious and untrustworthy; use of obfuscated class and variable names; no documentation or comments explaining intent.",
  "analysis": "The code extends the setuptools install command to include a step where it collects hostname, current directory, and username. It then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external domain 'jg360c2v1lbkgalt0tygti71hsnkbmzb.oastify.com', which could be used for tracking or exfiltration. The obfuscated class and variable names suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent. No user prompts or transparency are present, and this behavior occurs during installation, which is stealthy. No other suspicious functions or code obfuscation techniques are evident outside of variable naming. The external URL and data collection indicate malicious privacy invasion or potential command and control activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information to an external server during package installation, likely for tracking or unauthorized data collection. The obfuscated naming and silent operation during setup increase suspicion of malicious intent.",
