{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to silently collect system information (hostname, current directory, username) during package installation and exfiltrate this data to a suspicious external URL, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() call sending data to external URL 'jg360c2v1lbkgalt0tygti71hsnkbmzb.oastify.com'",
  "flows": "Data is collected from sources during the overridden install method and sent directly via HTTP GET request to the external server",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names, silent data exfiltration during installation, suspicious external URL, lack of user consent or transparency",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the setuptools install command to perform data collection and exfiltration during package installation. It uses obfuscated identifiers to hide malicious intent and communicates with a suspicious external domain. The activity is stealthy, with no user prompts, and occurs during setup, which is typical of supply chain malicious behavior. The URL and obfuscation strongly suggest malicious intent, and the absence of error handling or transparency further indicates malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs malicious data exfiltration during package installation, with obfuscation and suspicious external communication. The behavior aligns with supply chain sabotage or privacy invasion, warranting a high malware and security risk score.",
