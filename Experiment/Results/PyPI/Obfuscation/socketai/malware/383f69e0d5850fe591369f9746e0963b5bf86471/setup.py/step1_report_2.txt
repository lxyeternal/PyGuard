{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom installation command that gathers system information during package installation and sends it to a remote server.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() with system info as parameters, sending data to a remote server",
  "flows": "Gather system info (hostname, current directory, username) -> send data via HTTP GET request to external domain",
  "anomalies": "The code secretly collects system info without user consent, and the domain used for data exfiltration is suspicious and potentially malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and defines a subclass of the install command from setuptools. During installation, it collects hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data to an external domain ('jg360c2v1lbkgalt0tygti71hsnkbmzb.oastify.com') via a GET request. The request appears to be used for data exfiltration or tracking. The remote domain looks suspicious, and the data collection occurs silently during setup, indicating malicious intent. No other legitimate functionality is present, and the code's structure is minimal but malicious in behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, designed to silently collect and send system information to an external server during package installation. It acts as a backdoor or tracking mechanism with potential for data exfiltration.",
