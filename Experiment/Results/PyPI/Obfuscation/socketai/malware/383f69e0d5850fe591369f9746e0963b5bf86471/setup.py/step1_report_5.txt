  "purpose": "Customize package installation process to collect system information and send it to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Socket hostname retrieval, current working directory, username via getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() call to an external server with collected data as parameters",
  "flows": "During installation, gather hostname, cwd, username -> send data via HTTP GET request to external domain",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class name and method names, suspicious external request to obscure domain, no clear legitimate purpose for data exfiltration",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the installation process to collect hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data to an external server. The data collection occurs automatically during setup, and the target URL appears obfuscated. The code's structure and obfuscation suggest intent to stealthily exfiltrate environment info. No legitimate reason for such behavior in a typical package. The usage of requests to send data without user consent indicates malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by secretly collecting system information during installation and exfiltrating it to an external server, likely for tracking or data theft purposes.",
