{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom install command for a Python package that collects system information and sends it to a specified external server during installation.",
  "sources": "Reads hostname via socket.gethostname(), current working directory via os.getcwd(), and username via getpass.getuser().",
  "sinks": "Sends collected data via an HTTP GET request to 'jg360c2v1lbkgalt0tygti71hsnkbmzb.oastify.com'.",
  "flows": "Data collected from hostname, cwd, and username (sources) flow into the requests.get call as URL parameters (sink).",
  "anomalies": "The code uses obfuscated class and method names, which is unusual. It transmits system info to an external domain during package installation, which is suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script extends the install command from setuptools, overriding a method to gather system info and send it via HTTP request to an external server. The obfuscated names suggest an attempt to hide intent. Sending system info during installation without user consent is potentially malicious. The data flow indicates exfiltration of user environment data, which could be used for malicious purposes or tracking. The use of requests to an external domain in a setup script is atypical and suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is suspicious due to data exfiltration during package installation with obfuscated naming. It likely serves malicious intent by collecting and transmitting user system info without explicit consent.",
