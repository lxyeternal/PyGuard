{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom installation process that collects system information and reports it to a remote server during package installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads system hostname, current working directory, and username using socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), and getpass.getuser().",
  "sinks": "An HTTP GET request is sent to a remote server with collected system data as parameters, potentially leaking system info to an external entity.",
  "flows": "Data collected from system info sources flows into the requests.get() call, which sends data to the remote server.",
  "anomalies": "The class name appears obfuscated, and the URL endpoint is suspiciously short and obfuscated, hinting at potential malicious intent. The code secretly transmits system info without user consent during installation.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the 'install' command in setuptools to execute additional actions during package installation. It collects hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this info to a remote server via an HTTP GET request. The URL used is suspicious and could be used for malicious data exfiltration. The obfuscated class name and unconventional setup parameters suggest an attempt to hide malicious behavior. This activity could be used for tracking or data theft, especially if the server endpoint is malicious. No other malicious payloads are present, but the behavior is privacy-invasive and potentially malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code secretly transmits system information to a remote server during installation, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. It appears to be designed for data exfiltration or tracking without user consent, indicating malicious intent.",
