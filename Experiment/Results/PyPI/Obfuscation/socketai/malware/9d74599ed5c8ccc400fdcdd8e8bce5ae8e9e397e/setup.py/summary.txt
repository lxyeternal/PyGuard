  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high potential for malicious activity due to obfuscated, stealthy PowerShell execution during setup. The behavior aligns with supply chain attack tactics. Further decoding of the payload is recommended for confirmation, but current evidence warrants treating this as highly suspicious and potentially malicious."
