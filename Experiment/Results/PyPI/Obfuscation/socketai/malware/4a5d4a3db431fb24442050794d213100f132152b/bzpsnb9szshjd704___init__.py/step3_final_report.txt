  "purpose": "The code appears to be a Python script involved in data processing or utility functions, with no explicit malicious intent or suspicious patterns identified.",
  "sources": "Reads input from environment variables, user input, or external modules; no suspicious data sources detected.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes to network, files, or system commands, but no untrusted data flow leading to harmful actions observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or inputs to processing functions; no dangerous or untrusted data reaching critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no unusual control flow detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with standard data handling and processing. No signs of obfuscation, dynamic execution, or malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: low) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The high confidence scores further support this conclusion.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the analysis, the code is unlikely to be malicious or obfuscated. The security risk is minimal, and the code appears safe for use. The scores reflect a benign assessment, and no further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
