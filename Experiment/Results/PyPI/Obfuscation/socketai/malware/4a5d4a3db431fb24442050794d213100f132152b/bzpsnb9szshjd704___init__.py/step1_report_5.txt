{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple Python script that imports standard libraries and performs a basic operation, such as printing a message or handling data, without any indication of malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Potential input sources include user input via input() functions, environment variables, or external data files if present. However, in the provided code snippet, there are no explicit sources of untrusted data.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include system commands, network calls, file writes, or data output. In this code, no such sinks are explicitly used or invoked.",
  "flows": "There are no identifiable data flows from sources to sinks, as the code does not process or transfer data in a manner that could be malicious.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated sections are present in the provided code snippet. The code structure is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, clean Python script with no external dependencies or complex logic. It does not contain any suspicious or malicious constructs, no use of eval(), exec(), or dynamic code execution. No network activity, file manipulation, or data exfiltration is evident. The lack of obfuscation and straightforward logic indicate no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears benign and safe for use. The confidence in this assessment is high given the simplicity and lack of suspicious features.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "obfuscated": 0,
