  "sources": "Reads system hostname, current working directory, and username; makes an HTTP GET request to a remote server with collected data",

  "flows": "On installation, collects hostname, cwd, username and sends them via GET request to a remote URL",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names, unusual data collection, sending data during package installation without user consent",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that, during package installation, collects system hostname, current working directory, and username. It then sends this information to an external URL via an HTTP GET request. The obfuscated class and method names suggest an attempt to conceal behavior. The data collection and transmission occur automatically during the install process, which can be considered malicious if done without user knowledge. The data flow indicates potential privacy invasion and unauthorized data exfiltration. The use of external server communication during install is suspicious and a common trait in malicious code designed for data theft or tracking.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting system information and transmitting it to an external server during installation, likely without user consent. This indicates a supply chain security risk and privacy violation.",
