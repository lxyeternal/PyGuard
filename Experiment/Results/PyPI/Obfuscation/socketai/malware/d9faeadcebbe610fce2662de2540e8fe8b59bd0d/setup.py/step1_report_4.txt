{
  "purpose": "The script defines a custom setup command that, during installation, collects system information and sends it to a specified external server.",
  "sources": "The code reads system hostname (socket.gethostname()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), and current username (getpass.getuser()).",
  "sinks": "The code sends data to an external server via requests.get() with parameters containing system info.",
  "flows": "Data from system information sources flows into the requests.get() call, which transmits it over the network to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class and function names, and the unsolicited transmission of system information to an external domain. The domain appears suspicious and unrelated to typical package behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules for setup and system info collection, and also requests for network communication. The custom install class overrides the install method to gather hostname, current directory, and username. It then sends this information to a suspicious external URL. The obfuscated naming suggests an attempt to hide malicious intent. The network call occurs during the installation process, which is unusual for benign packages. No user consent is requested, and no logs or checks are implemented. This behavior could be used for tracking, data exfiltration, or other malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains malicious behavior by collecting system data and transmitting it to an external server during installation. The obfuscation and network activity are suspicious and indicative of potential malware or a privacy breach.",
