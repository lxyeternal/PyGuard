{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom setup class that, during installation, collects system hostname, current working directory, and username, then exfiltrates this data via an HTTP GET request to an external URL, indicating malicious data theft during package install.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() to external URL with collected data",
  "flows": "source functions (hostname, cwd, username) -> data packaging -> requests.get() to external domain",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names; data exfiltration during installation without user consent; network request to suspicious external domain",
  "analysis": "The code defines an obfuscated custom install class that, during the installation process, gathers hostname, current directory, and username, then sends this information via a GET request to an external server. The method overridden is non-standard ('tfCChfvlWXXzxAelqHyyLtirXWHtBdVd' instead of 'run'), but the intent is clear. The external URL is suspicious, and the data collection occurs covertly during setup, indicating malicious behavior. The obfuscation and network activity are consistent with supply chain sabotage or privacy invasion. Scores assigned in reports (malware ~0.9, security risk ~0.9, obfuscation ~0.8-1) are justified by the behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs covert data exfiltration during package installation, using obfuscation and external communication to conceal malicious intent. The behavior aligns with high-severity supply chain attack vectors, warranting high malware and risk scores. The code's obfuscation and network activity justify the high scores, and all reports correctly identify this malicious pattern.",
