{
  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup that, during installation, collects system information and exfiltrates it to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Socket hostname, current working directory, username via getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() call sending data to a remote URL",
  "flows": "Collect system info -> send data via GET request to external URL",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names, data exfiltration to suspicious external domain during install process",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation command that, when invoked, gathers hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via a GET request to a specified external URL. The obfuscated naming indicates an attempt to conceal malicious intent. The data exfiltration occurs during package installation, which is suspicious behavior. The code appears designed to collect potentially sensitive system information without user consent, indicating malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior characterized by data exfiltration during installation, with obfuscated code and suspicious external communication. It exhibits signs of a supply chain attack vector designed to harvest system information covertly.",
