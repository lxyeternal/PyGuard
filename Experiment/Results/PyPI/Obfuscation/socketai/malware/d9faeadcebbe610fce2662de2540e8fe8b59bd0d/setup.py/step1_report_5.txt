{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package with a custom install command that performs data exfiltration upon installation.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser() used to gather system information; requests.get() used to send data to an external server.",
  "sinks": "requests.get() sends collected system info to a remote URL, which could leak user data.",
  "flows": "Gather system info via socket, os, and getpass; then send this data to an external server through requests.get() during installation.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names; code executes network request during installation without user consent; data is sent to a suspicious domain (burpcollaborator.net).",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and overrides the install command to execute additional code during package installation. It collects hostname, current directory, and username, then sends this info via a GET request to a specified URL. The class and method names are intentionally obfuscated, which is suspicious. The use of requests to transmit system information without user awareness indicates potential malicious intent, possibly for data harvesting or backdoor activity. The server domain (burpcollaborator.net) is known for testing and may be used for malicious data collection or testing purposes. The code does not appear to perform any harmful system modifications but actively leaks system info.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during package installation to an external server. Obfuscated identifiers and the timing of data transmission raise suspicion of malicious intent, potentially serving as a backdoor or data collection mechanism.",
