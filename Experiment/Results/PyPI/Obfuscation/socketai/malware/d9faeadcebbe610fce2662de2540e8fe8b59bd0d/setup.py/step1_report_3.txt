{
  "purpose": "Setuptools installation script that collects system information and sends it to an external server during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads hostname, current working directory, and username from the system; it also makes an HTTP GET request to an external URL.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get() function transmits collected system information to an external domain, potentially leaking data.",
  "flows": "System info variables (hostname, cwd, username) are sent via an HTTP GET request to an external server during the install process.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names, unusual use of the install class to perform network activity during package setup, hard to interpret variable names, and external data exfiltration without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation command that extends setuptools' install class. During installation, it collects system hostname, current working directory, and username. It then sends this data to a specific external URL via an HTTP GET request, which could be used for tracking, reconnaissance, or data exfiltration. The obfuscation and the network activity within a setup script are suspicious behaviors often associated with malicious intent. No other malicious code, backdoors, or payloads are evident, but the behavior is highly suspicious for malicious or privacy-invasive purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be designed for data exfiltration during package installation, likely malicious or privacy-invasive. The obfuscation and unsolicited network request strongly suggest malicious intent, despite being packaged as a setup script.",
