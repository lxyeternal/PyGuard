{
  "purpose": "The code collects system uptime, OS details, and IP address, then exfiltrates this information to a remote server during package installation, indicating malicious data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Reading '/proc/uptime', gathering platform info via 'platform' module, retrieving local IP via 'socket.gethostbyname(socket.gethostname())'.",
  "sinks": "Establishing a TCP connection to '134.209.85.64' on port '9090' and sending the collected data over this socket.",
  "flows": "The code reads system info from sources, constructs a data string, and transmits it through a socket connection during the execution of the custom install command.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function and class names, network activity during package installation, hardcoded external IP address, no user consent or benign purpose for data transmission.",
  "analysis": "The code performs covert data collection and exfiltration during package installation, which is suspicious. The obfuscation and hardcoded IP suggest malicious intent. The network activity and data sent are indicative of malware behavior. The code lacks any benign functionality and operates silently without user awareness.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during installation, supported by obfuscation and hardcoded IP. It should be classified as highly suspicious or malicious, warranting removal or further investigation.",
