{
  "purpose": "This code appears to gather system information, uptime, and network details, then sends the data to an external IP address during installation of a Python package.",
  "sources": "Reads system uptime from '/proc/uptime', retrieves platform and network information, and uses socket to establish an outbound connection.",
  "sinks": "Sends collected data over a socket connection to a remote IP address (134.209.85.64:9090).",
  "flows": "System info and uptime are collected, formatted, and transmitted via socket connection to a remote server.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs network communication during package installation, which is unusual. The variable and function names are obfuscated. The external IP and port suggest possible command and control or data exfiltration activity.",
  "analysis": "The script collects system uptime, OS details, and IP information, then immediately sends this data to a specific remote server during the package installation process. The use of obfuscated names and the network transmission during install are suspicious. There is no user interaction or explicit consent. The code does not perform any benign or necessary setup tasks but focuses on data collection and exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior characteristic of data exfiltration or reconnaissance malware. It collects system info and transmits it to an external server during installation, which is suspicious. The package appears to be designed for covert data collection.",
