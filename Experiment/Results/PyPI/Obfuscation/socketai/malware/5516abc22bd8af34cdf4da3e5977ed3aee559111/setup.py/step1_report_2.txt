{
  "purpose": "The code appears to gather system information and send it to a remote server, potentially for reconnaissance or unauthorized data collection.",
  "sources": "Reading system uptime from '/proc/uptime', gathering platform details via 'platform' module, obtaining local IP via 'socket.gethostbyname', and reading environment variables or system info indirectly through 'socket' and 'platform'.",
  "sinks": "Sending collected data over a network socket to IP '134.209.85.64' on port 9090, which could be used for exfiltration.",
  "flows": "System info gathered from '/proc/uptime' and platform modules → formatted into a string → sent via socket to remote IP.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function and variable names, code that reads system uptime, and a hardcoded IP address to which data is sent without clear legitimate purpose. No user input or configuration appears to influence the network connection, and there is no clear benign reason for this data transmission.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various modules, including 'urllib.request', 'socket', 'os', and 'pty', but only uses 'platform' and 'socket' for gathering system info. The function 'KfnAlmHeICsZHjcHbDjNmEFYTUHPDqeK' reads the system's uptime from '/proc/uptime', processes it, and compiles system info such as OS details and IP address. It then opens a TCP socket to a specific IP address (134.209.85.64) on port 9090 and sends the collected data. The class 'ktcHHQELopWFibicUMvicOcoXxKDADOZ' overrides the install command to invoke this function during package installation, executing potentially malicious data exfiltration upon package install. The obfuscated function and class names suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent. The overall behavior indicates the code is designed to secretly collect and transmit system information to an external server, which is characteristic of malware or malicious supply chain behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated function and variable names, reads system information, and sends it to a remote server during package installation. This behavior strongly suggests malicious intent, likely for reconnaissance or data exfiltration. The package's purpose appears suspicious and potentially harmful.",
