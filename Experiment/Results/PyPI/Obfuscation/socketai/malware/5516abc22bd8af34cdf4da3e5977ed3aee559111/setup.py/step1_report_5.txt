{
  "purpose": "The code appears to gather system information and uptime, then transmit this data to a specific remote IP address, likely for remote monitoring or data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Reads system uptime from /proc/uptime; gathers system info via platform and socket modules; reads hostname for IP details.",
  "sinks": "Sends collected system data over a network socket to 134.209.85.64:9090.",
  "flows": "Reads system uptime and info -> formats data -> establishes socket connection -> sends data to remote IP.",
  "anomalies": "Uses obscure function and variable names; hardcoded IP address for data exfiltration; performs network communication within a setup script, which is unusual; no clear user interaction or legitimate purpose documented.",
  "analysis": "The script collects system uptime and system information, formats it, and immediately transmits this data to an external server via socket connection during installation. The use of unusual naming conventions and the direct network connection during package setup suggest potential malicious intent or covert data collection. No other benign purpose is evident. The code does not include user prompts or clear configuration, indicating it runs automatically when the package is installed.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior by collecting system information and transmitting it to an external IP address without user consent, indicating potential data exfiltration. The obfuscated variable and function names further suggest malicious intent. This package should be considered potentially malicious and unsafe to use.",
