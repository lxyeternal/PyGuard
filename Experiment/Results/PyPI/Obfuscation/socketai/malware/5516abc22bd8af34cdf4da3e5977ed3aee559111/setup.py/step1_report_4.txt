{
  "purpose": "The code appears to gather system and network information and send it to a remote server, possibly for monitoring or malicious data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Reads system uptime from '/proc/uptime', retrieves system info via platform and socket modules, and gets hostname IP details via socket.gethostbyname.",
  "sinks": "Connects to IP '134.209.85.64' on port 9090 and sends data over this socket.",
  "flows": "System info and uptime are collected, formatted into a string, then sent over an outgoing TCP connection to the specified IP address.",
  "anomalies": "Code uses obfuscated variable names, performs data exfiltration without user consent, connects to a suspicious IP address, and is embedded within a setup script which is unusual for malicious payloads. It also imports 'os', 'pty', but does not use them, indicating possible obfuscation or evasion techniques.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a function that reads system uptime and gathers OS details, then formats and transmits this data to a remote server. It is called during the package installation process via a custom 'install' class. The network connection to an external IP and transmission of system data without user knowledge are suspicious behaviors. The obfuscated variable names and the embedded network activity suggest an attempt at stealth. There are no other malicious functions like code execution, data theft, or backdoors detected, but the data exfiltration pattern is concerning.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates potentially malicious behavior, mainly data exfiltration of system information to an external server during package installation. While no direct harm like system modification is evident, its intent to secretly transmit system details is suspicious and likely malicious.",
