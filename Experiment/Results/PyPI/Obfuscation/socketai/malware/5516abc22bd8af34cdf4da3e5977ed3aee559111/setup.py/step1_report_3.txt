{
  "purpose": "The code appears to collect system information, uptime, and network details, then sends this data to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Reads system uptime from /proc/uptime, gathers platform info via platform module, retrieves hostname IP, and uses socket to connect and send data.",
  "sinks": "Sends collected data over a socket connection to IP 134.209.85.64 on port 9090.",
  "flows": "Reads system info and uptime -> formats data -> establishes socket connection -> transmits data to remote server.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual code naming (obfuscated function and class names), hardcoded IP address, network connection initiated during installation, no clear benign purpose, usage of socket to send data to external IP without clear user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that gathers system uptime, OS info, and IP address, then constructs a message with this data. It then establishes a socket connection to a remote server at 134.209.85.64:9090 and sends the information. The function is invoked during package installation via a custom 'install' command class. The obfuscated naming and network activity during install raise suspicions. No user input is involved, and there is no indication of legitimate use for this network communication. The code could be used for malicious data exfiltration or remote command and control.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits suspicious behavior, primarily due to its network activity during package installation and the obfuscated nature. It appears designed to collect system info and send it to a remote server without clear user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity. While no direct malware payload is evident, the behavior is potentially malicious.",
