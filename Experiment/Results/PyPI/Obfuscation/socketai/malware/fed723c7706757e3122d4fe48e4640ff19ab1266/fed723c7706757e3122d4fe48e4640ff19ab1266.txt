      "conclusion": "The code contains an explicit, malicious reverse shell payload executed during installation, representing a severe security risk. The package should be flagged as malware with maximum risk scores. The obfuscation score is justified by the package name, but the code itself is straightforward. All reports correctly identify this behavior, and the evidence supports a malware score of 1.0, risk score of 1.0, and obfuscation score around 0.7."

      "conclusion": "Most reports correctly identify the absence of malicious code, with Report 3 appropriately flagged for suspicious patterns. The scoring system aligns with the described anomalies, and no significant adjustments are necessary. The high scores in Report 3 are justified if the patterns are confirmed; otherwise, they should be considered tentative. The overall security posture of the dependency appears benign except for the noted suspicious patterns in Report 3."
