  "conclusion": "Most reports correctly identify the absence of malicious code, with Report 3 appropriately flagged for suspicious patterns. The scoring system aligns with the described anomalies, and no significant adjustments are necessary. The high scores in Report 3 are justified if the patterns are confirmed; otherwise, they should be considered tentative. The overall security posture of the dependency appears benign except for the noted suspicious patterns in Report 3."
