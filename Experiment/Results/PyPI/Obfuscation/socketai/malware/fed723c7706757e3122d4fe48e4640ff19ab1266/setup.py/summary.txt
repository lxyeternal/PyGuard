  "conclusion": "The code contains an explicit, malicious reverse shell payload executed during installation, representing a severe security risk. The package should be flagged as malware with maximum risk scores. The obfuscation score is justified by the package name, but the code itself is straightforward. All reports correctly identify this behavior, and the evidence supports a malware score of 1.0, risk score of 1.0, and obfuscation score around 0.7."
