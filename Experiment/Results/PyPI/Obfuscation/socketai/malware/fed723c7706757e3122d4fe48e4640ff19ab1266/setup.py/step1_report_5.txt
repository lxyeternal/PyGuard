  "purpose": "Define a custom installation process that executes additional commands post-installation.",
  "sources": "os.system call within the CustomInstallCommand.run() method.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executes a bash command which initiates a reverse TCP connection to an external IP address.",
  "flows": "During installation, the run() method triggers os.system with a reverse shell command connecting to 114.116.119.253 on port 7888.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system to execute a network reverse shell command during installation, which is highly suspicious and unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom setup command that, after completing standard installation, runs a reverse shell to an external IP address using bash. This behavior indicates potential malicious intent, as it creates a backdoor during package installation. No other code or data inputs are involved; the malicious code is embedded directly within the install process. The setup package name appears random, possibly to evade detection. This pattern is typical of supply chain attacks aiming to establish unauthorized remote access.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes malicious behavior by executing a reverse shell during package installation. This is a significant security risk and indicates deliberate malicious intent to establish unauthorized remote access. The package should be considered malicious and unsafe to install.",
