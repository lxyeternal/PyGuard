  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup configuration with a custom install command.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables and executes a system command during installation.",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing a bash command that opens a reverse shell connection.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom run method triggers os.system, executing a reverse shell payload.",
  "anomalies": "The use of os.system with a hardcoded IP and port for reverse shell; custom install command that executes malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code uses setuptools to define package setup parameters and overrides the install command with a custom class. In the run method of this class, it calls the superclass's run method, then executes a bash command via os.system. The bash command initiates a reverse shell connection to IP 114.116.119.253 on port 7888, which is a common indicator of malicious activity. The presence of this reverse shell code during package installation suggests malicious intent, as it allows remote access to the host system without user consent. No other benign functionality is evident; the core purpose is to establish unauthorized remote access. The hardcoded IP and port, along with the execution of shell commands during setup, are typical markers of malicious behavior in supply chain attacks.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious reverse shell payload embedded in the custom installation command, indicating high malicious intent and security risk. The package is likely intended to compromise systems during installation.",
