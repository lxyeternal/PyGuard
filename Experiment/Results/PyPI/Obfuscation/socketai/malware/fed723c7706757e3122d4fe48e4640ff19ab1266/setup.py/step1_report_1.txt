{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup script that customizes the installation process.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input data directly; it primarily executes during package installation.",
  "sinks": "The `os.system` call executes a command that could establish a network connection to an external IP address.",
  "flows": "After installation, the custom run method executes a bash command that opens a reverse shell to IP 114.116.119.253 on port 7888.",
  "anomalies": "The use of a hardcoded IP address and reverse shell command in the post-install script is highly suspicious and indicative of malicious intent. The setup package name appears obfuscated, which is a common tactic to hide malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools for package setup, defines a custom install class, and overrides the run method. The overridden run method first executes the standard install process, then invokes os.system to run a bash reverse shell command connecting to a specific external IP. The reverse shell is a common tactic used by attackers to maintain remote access to compromised systems. The presence of a hardcoded IP and reverse shell command strongly suggests malicious activity aimed at establishing unauthorized remote access during installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious reverse shell payload executed post-installation, indicating malicious behavior with potential for remote compromise. The package appears intentionally obfuscated with a nonsensical name, likely to evade detection. Overall, this package should be considered malicious and should not be used.",
