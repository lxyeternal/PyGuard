  "purpose": "Define a custom setup configuration for a Python package that executes a network connection command upon installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata and executes a system command during installation.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executes a network connection to an external IP and port, which could lead to data exfiltration or remote control.",
  "flows": "The setup script runs the CustomInstallCommand, which after the standard installation, executes a bash command to establish a reverse shell connection to 114.116.119.253 on port 7888.",
  "anomalies": "The use of os.system to execute a reverse shell command during package installation is highly unusual and suspicious. The hardcoded IP address and command pattern indicate malicious intent. The code does not perform any meaningful setup beyond this malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setuptools modules to define package setup parameters. It then defines a CustomInstallCommand class inheriting from the install command, overriding the run method. After executing the standard install process, it runs a bash command that opens a reverse shell to an external IP address, which is indicative of malicious behavior, such as remote access or command and control. The setup call registers this custom command. There are no other benign or benign-looking code sections; the key malicious activity is the reverse shell execution embedded within the install process.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to perform malicious activity by establishing a reverse shell upon installation of the package. This constitutes a security threat and should be considered malicious malware. The package could allow remote control of the host system, leading to potential data theft or system compromise.",
