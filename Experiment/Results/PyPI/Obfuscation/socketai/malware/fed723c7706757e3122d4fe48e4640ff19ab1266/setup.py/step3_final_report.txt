{
  "purpose": "This code executes a reverse shell connection to a remote IP during package installation, indicating malicious intent and potential backdoor access.",
  "sources": "The os.system call executing the bash reverse shell command during the run() method of the CustomInstallCommand class.",
  "sinks": "The os.system invocation that runs the bash reverse shell, which establishes an outbound network connection to the specified IP and port.",
  "flows": "Input source is the code execution within the run() method; the sink is the os.system call that executes the reverse shell command, establishing remote access.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional execution of a reverse shell during installation, hardcoded IP address and port, obfuscated package name, and execution of network-reliant malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that, after completing standard installation, runs a bash reverse shell to a hardcoded IP and port via os.system. This creates a backdoor, allowing remote control of the host system. The package name appears obfuscated, likely to evade detection. The malicious activity is explicit and unambiguous, with no benign explanation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 1.0, risk: 1.0, obfuscation: approximately 0.7) are justified given the clear malicious behavior. The code's straightforward nature means obfuscation is limited to the package name, not the code itself. The high confidence score (around 0.95) reflects certainty in malicious intent. Overall, the package constitutes a severe security threat and should be classified as malicious malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains an explicit, malicious reverse shell payload executed during installation, representing a severe security risk. The package should be flagged as malware with maximum risk scores. The obfuscation score is justified by the package name, but the code itself is straightforward. All reports correctly identify this behavior, and the evidence supports a malware score of 1.0, risk score of 1.0, and obfuscation score around 0.7.",
