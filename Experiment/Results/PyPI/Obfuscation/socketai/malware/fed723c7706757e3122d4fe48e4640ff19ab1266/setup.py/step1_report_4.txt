{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup configuration with a custom installation command.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables during setup and executes a system command in the custom install class.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executes a bash command that opens a reverse TCP shell to an external IP address.",
  "flows": "The run() method of CustomInstallCommand triggers the os.system command, which establishes an outbound connection to the specified IP and port.",
  "anomalies": "The use of os.system to run a reverse shell command during installation is highly suspicious and indicative of malicious intent. The code runs an active reverse shell connection to an external IP address during package installation.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools modules for package setup, which is standard. However, it overrides the install command to include a call to os.system executing a bash reverse shell to 114.116.119.253 on port 7888. This behavior is unusual and malicious, as it creates a backdoor during installation, potentially allowing remote control of the host machine. The reverse shell is executed unconditionally during the install process, indicating malicious intent. No other benign functionality is present; the setup appears solely designed to include malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, implementing a reverse shell during package installation. The presence of the reverse shell command indicates an intent to compromise the host system remotely. The package should be considered dangerous and not used.",
