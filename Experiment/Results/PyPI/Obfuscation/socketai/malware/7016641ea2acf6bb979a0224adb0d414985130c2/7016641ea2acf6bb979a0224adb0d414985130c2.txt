      "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior through covert system info collection and transmission to an external server, embedded within a package setup script. The obfuscation and network activity strongly suggest malicious intent, warranting high malware and security risk scores. It should be treated as malicious or highly suspicious."

The reports and scores are consistent and appropriate."

While no definitive malicious activity is confirmed, the pattern warrants thorough review of the load_member function and the contents of the list. The likelihood of malicious behavior is moderate, with a malware score around 0.5, obfuscation score about 0.75, and overall security risk approximately 0.65."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration access pattern with obfuscated names. There is no evidence of malicious activity or vulnerabilities in this fragment. Obfuscation alone is a red flag but not proof of malicious intent. The scores should reflect low malware likelihood (around 0.1), high obfuscation (around 0.7), and moderate security risk (around 0.2-0.3). Further context is needed to assess downstream impact, but based solely on this snippet, it is considered safe."

      "conclusion": "The code is a typical Django URL routing setup with obfuscated names. No malicious activity is apparent from this snippet. Obfuscation alone does not imply malicious intent but should prompt further review of the view's implementation. Current scores are appropriate; malware and risk scores should remain low unless additional malicious logic is found."

Report 4's patterns justify a higher suspicion level, with a malware score around 0.6, obfuscation at 0.6, and risk at 0.6. No evidence suggests confirmed malicious payloads, but the suspicious patterns merit further investigation before deployment."
