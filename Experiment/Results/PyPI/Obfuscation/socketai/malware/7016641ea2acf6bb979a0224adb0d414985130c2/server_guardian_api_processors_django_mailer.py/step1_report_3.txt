  "purpose": "Monitor the number of deferred and queued email messages in the Django mailer application.",
  "sources": "Message.objects.deferred().count() and Message.objects.exclude(...).filter(...).count() for data about message states.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks are present; the functions return status labels and info strings based on database counts.",
  "flows": "Data flows from database queries (sources) to status determination and info message generation (sinks), without executing untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code anomalies detected. The constants and logic are straightforward. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions that query the database for email message counts, comparing these counts to thresholds to determine status levels. No external input processing, command execution, or malicious data handling is evident. No code injection, backdoors, or data leaks are observed. Constants and logic appear to serve monitoring purposes. The code seems benign and purely informational.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard monitoring utility for email message queues, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It simply reports message counts and status levels based on database queries.",
