  "purpose": "Monitor the status of deferred and queued email messages in a Django application.",
  "sources": "Reading from Message.objects (database query), accessing constants from imported modules and dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "Database queries; formatted string outputs.",
  "flows": "Querying the database for message counts -> formatting and returning status info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors observed. The code primarily performs status checks and counts.",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves message counts from the database to assess email queue health, using Django ORM queries. It uses constants to set thresholds and returns status labels based on counts. The imported constants and variables appear to control thresholds and labels without any suspicious logic. No suspicious code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior detected. The code is straightforward and intended for status monitoring. No obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or malicious network activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard status-checking module for email message queues in a Django app. It performs no malicious actions or suspicious behaviors. It appears safe and intended for operational monitoring.",
