  "purpose": "Define a dictionary mapping status labels to their string representations.",
  "sources": "No input or external data sources used in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data flows or affects system behavior.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is static data definition.",
  "anomalies": "The variable name 'YFlrdSrZDGcKdkGlNEDuuBwmmMAznexy' appears to be a random, nonsensical string, which may suggest obfuscation or malicious intent. However, it could also be an arbitrary variable name.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a dictionary with status strings, which is typical for status labeling. The variable name is unusual and potentially obfuscated, but no malicious behavior or external data handling is evident. There are no functions, input/output, or operations that could be malicious. The code is simple and static.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward static dictionary definition with an unusual variable name. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The obfuscated-looking variable name alone does not indicate malicious behavior, but warrants further context if available.",
