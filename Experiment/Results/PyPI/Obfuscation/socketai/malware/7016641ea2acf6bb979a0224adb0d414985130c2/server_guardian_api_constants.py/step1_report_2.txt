  "sinks": "No external or untrusted data inputs or outputs",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "The variable name appears obfuscated or nonsensical; no clear purpose; no apparent malicious activity",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a dictionary to a variable with an obfuscated name consisting of random characters. The dictionary contains simple string mappings: 'OK', 'WARNING', 'DANGER'. There are no functions, input/output operations, network activity, or other behaviors. The variable name may be intentionally obscure, but the content itself is benign. No malicious behavior, no secrets, no suspicious patterns observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward assignment of a benign dictionary with obfuscated variable name. There is no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior within this code snippet.",
