  "purpose": "Defines a dictionary mapping status strings to labels with an obfuscated variable name.",
  "sources": "The variable assignment itself; no external data sources or inputs.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external calls are present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static assignment with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable name 'YFlrdSrZDGcKdkGlNEDuuBwmmMAznexy'; no malicious code or behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static dictionary assignment with a nonsensical variable name. No inputs, outputs, network activity, or dynamic behavior are present. The variable name appears obfuscated but does not indicate malicious intent. Malware scores are zero across all reports, and security risk scores are also zero, consistent with benign code. Obfuscation scores vary from 0.3 to 0.8 depending on the perceived suspicion of the variable name, which is reasonable given the context. The code does not contain any malicious or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation is likely just a naming choice or code obfuscation, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscated variable name alone does not imply malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
