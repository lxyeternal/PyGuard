{
  "purpose": "The code appears to provide dummy or placeholder functionality, possibly for testing or stub purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a relative module '..constants' that provides a variable or constant named YFlrdSrZDGcKdkGlNEDuuBwmmMAznexy.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain typical data sinks such as network, file, or environment variable usage. It raises an exception and returns a dictionary, both of which could be harmless depending on context.",
  "flows": "The import source supplies YFlrdSrZDGcKdkGlNEDuuBwmmMAznexy, which is used in the return dictionary. No untrusted input or data flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "The variable and function names are obfuscated and nonsensical, which is suspicious. The import relies on a relative module, which could be benign or malicious depending on context. No explicit malicious activity detected, but obfuscation raises concern.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a possibly obfuscated constant, then defines a function that raises an exception with a generic message, likely a placeholder or error handler. Another function returns a dictionary with a label, a status taken from the imported constant, and info text. The use of obfuscated names and relative import can be suspicious, especially if the source of constants is unknown or untrusted. The code itself does not perform malicious actions but could be part of a larger malicious or benign framework. No malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or network activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a dummy or placeholder module with obfuscated identifiers, possibly used for testing or as a stub. No malicious activity is evident within this snippet, though obfuscation warrants cautious review of the overall package. It does not contain malware or security risks based on the provided code.",
