{
  "purpose": "The code imports an obfuscated constant, defines a function that raises an exception, and another that returns static data, likely serving as a placeholder or configuration module.",
  "sources": "Import of obfuscated constant from a relative module; static return value in function.",
  "sinks": "Exception raising function (disrupts flow); static data returned (no data leaks).",
  "flows": "Function call triggers exception or returns static data; no external data or network activity observed.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated identifiers; import from an unspecified relative module; unconditional exception raise.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal with obfuscated naming, which can conceal malicious intent. The exception-raising function could be exploited to disrupt normal operation, but no network, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are evident. The static return function appears benign. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware is not present. The risk is low but slightly elevated due to the disruptive potential of the exception.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, obfuscated placeholder with no active malicious behavior. The main concern is obfuscation and the potential for disruption via the exception-raising function. No evidence of malware or malicious payloads is detected.",
