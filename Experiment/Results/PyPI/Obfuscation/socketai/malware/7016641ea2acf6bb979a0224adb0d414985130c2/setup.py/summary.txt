  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior through covert system info collection and transmission to an external server, embedded within a package setup script. The obfuscation and network activity strongly suggest malicious intent, warranting high malware and security risk scores. It should be treated as malicious or highly suspicious."
