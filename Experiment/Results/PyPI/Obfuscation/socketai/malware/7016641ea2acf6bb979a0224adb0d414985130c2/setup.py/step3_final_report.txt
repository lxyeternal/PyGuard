{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package that, upon execution, gathers system information, obfuscates it, and transmits it to an external server via a socket connection, likely for malicious data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Reading system info (current directory, username, hostname), obfuscated string decoding, socket connection to external IP, data transmission",
  "sinks": "Socket connection to external server, sending obfuscated system info data",
  "flows": "Gather system info -> Obfuscate data -> Decode external server address -> Establish socket connection -> Send data -> Close connection",
  "anomalies": "Use of XOR and base64 obfuscation, broad try-except block suppressing errors, connection to an obfuscated external IP, data exfiltration behavior embedded in setup script",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup tasks but includes a suspicious try-except block that collects system info, obfuscates it with XOR and base64, and sends it over a socket to an external server. The external address is encoded, and the network activity is unnecessary for a setup script, indicating malicious intent. Silent exception handling conceals failures, and obfuscation techniques aim to hide the activity. The behavior aligns with covert data exfiltration or backdoor communication, justified by high malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior through covert system info collection and transmission to an external server, embedded within a package setup script. The obfuscation and network activity strongly suggest malicious intent, warranting high malware and security risk scores. It should be treated as malicious or highly suspicious.",
