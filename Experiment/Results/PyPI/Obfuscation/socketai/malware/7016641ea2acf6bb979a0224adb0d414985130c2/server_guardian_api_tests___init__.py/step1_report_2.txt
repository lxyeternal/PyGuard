{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple utility script that processes user input and performs some operations based on it.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the 'input()' function call at the beginning of the script.",
  "sinks": "Data is used in the calculation and then printed out; the 'print()' function acts as a sink for output.",
  "flows": "Input received via 'input()' -> processed with calculations -> output via 'print()'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No obfuscated code, hidden network activity, or unusual dynamic execution. The code's simplicity minimizes risk.",
  "analysis": "The script reads user input, performs a basic mathematical operation, and outputs the result. No external network requests, file I/O, or environment variable usage is present. The logic is straightforward with no hidden behaviors. There are no signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a simple calculation based on user input without any malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
