  "purpose": "This source code appears to be a standard Python module, potentially for handling data processing or utility functions, but the specific purpose cannot be determined due to lack of context.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input functions, environment variables, and possibly external files or network sources if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, network transmissions, or file writes that could leak data or execute untrusted commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as user input or environment variables through processing functions toward sinks like system commands or network endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are detected. The code structure appears standard without suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward with clear variable usage and no signs of obfuscation. There are no indications of malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity. Usage of third-party libraries appears typical. No suspicious code injection or unsafe operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems benign, with no anomalies or malware indicators identified.",
