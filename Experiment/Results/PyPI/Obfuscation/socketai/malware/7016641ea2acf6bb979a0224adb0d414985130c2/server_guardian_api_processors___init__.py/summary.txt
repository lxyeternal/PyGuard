  "conclusion": "Most reports indicate benign code with appropriate low malware and security risk scores. Report 4's patterns justify a higher suspicion level, with a malware score around 0.6, obfuscation at 0.6, and risk at 0.6. No evidence suggests confirmed malicious payloads, but the suspicious patterns merit further investigation before deployment."
