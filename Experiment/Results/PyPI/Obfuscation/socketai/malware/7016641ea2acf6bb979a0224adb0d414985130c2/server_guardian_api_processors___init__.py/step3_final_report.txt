{
  "purpose": "Analyze the provided Python code dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code patterns such as obfuscation, dynamic execution, hardcoded secrets, and untrusted data handling.",
  "sources": "Use of eval()/exec(), reading environment variables, input functions, network connections, file operations, and any dynamic code execution points.",
  "sinks": "Potential data exfiltration points, network transmissions, file modifications, environment variable access, or command executions that could lead to security breaches.",
  "flows": "From sources like untrusted input or environment variables to sinks such as network sockets, file writes, or command execution functions, indicating potential malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscation, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), hardcoded credentials, suspicious network domains, or unusual import patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits no suspicious patterns in reports 1-3, with high confidence of benign behavior. Report 4 indicates use of eval()/exec(), obfuscation, and untrusted input, which are signs of potential malicious or risky behavior, warranting a malware score of approximately 0.6. Report 5 lacks code, thus no risk. The scores across reports are consistent with the described behaviors. The main concern is report 4, which should be flagged for further review. Overall, the code appears safe in most cases, with a moderate risk in report 4 due to risky patterns.",
  "conclusion": "Most reports indicate benign code with appropriate low malware and security risk scores. Report 4's patterns justify a higher suspicion level, with a malware score around 0.6, obfuscation at 0.6, and risk at 0.6. No evidence suggests confirmed malicious payloads, but the suspicious patterns merit further investigation before deployment.",
