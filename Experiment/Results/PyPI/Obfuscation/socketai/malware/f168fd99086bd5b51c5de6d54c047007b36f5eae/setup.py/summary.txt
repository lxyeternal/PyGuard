  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated, silently executed PowerShell command during package setup, strongly indicating malicious activity. The high malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores are justified. It should be treated as malicious or requiring further decoding and analysis to confirm payload actions."
