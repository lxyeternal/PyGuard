  "purpose": "Detects and executes a hidden, encoded PowerShell command during package setup, potentially for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "The check for 'tahg' directory; the subprocess.Popen call executing the encoded PowerShell command.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen call that runs the encoded command; potential for executing malicious payloads or establishing backdoors.",
  "flows": "Directory existence check -> execution of encoded PowerShell command via subprocess -> silent, obfuscated code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64-encoded PowerShell command with -EncodedCommand; silent execution with -WindowStyle Hidden; broad exception handling suppressing errors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard setup but includes a suspicious silent execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command encoded in base64. The command is run with hidden window flags, and errors are suppressed broadly, concealing failures. This pattern is characteristic of malicious payload delivery or backdoor installation. The high obfuscation score reflects the encoded nature, and the malware score indicates a high suspicion of malicious intent. The behavior aligns with common supply chain attack tactics, warranting caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated, silently executed PowerShell command during package setup, strongly indicating malicious activity. The high malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores are justified. It should be treated as malicious or requiring further decoding and analysis to confirm payload actions.",
