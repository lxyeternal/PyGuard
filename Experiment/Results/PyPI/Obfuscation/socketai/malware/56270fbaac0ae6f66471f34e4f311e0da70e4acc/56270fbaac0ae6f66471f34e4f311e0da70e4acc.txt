The obfuscation is superficial and does not suggest malicious intent. The scores are consistent with the benign nature of the code."

      "conclusion": "This code is a credential-stealing malware designed to harvest Discord and browser tokens from local storage and exfiltrate them via a webhook. Its obfuscation, pattern matching, and silent network requests confirm malicious behavior with high confidence. The malware score is 1.0, security risk is 1.0, and obfuscation is high but not maximal, with a score of 0.8."
