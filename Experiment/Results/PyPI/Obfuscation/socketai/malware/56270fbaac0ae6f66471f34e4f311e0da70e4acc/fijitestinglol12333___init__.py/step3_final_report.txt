{
  "purpose": "The code searches local storage directories for Discord and browser tokens, extracts potential credential tokens using regex patterns, and exfiltrates this data via a hardcoded Discord webhook URL.",
  "sources": "Files in directories related to Discord, Chrome, Opera, Brave, Yandex, and environment variables for user data directories; specifically, local storage files and logs.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST request to a Discord webhook URL, transmitting the collected tokens and system info.",
  "flows": "The code reads token patterns from local files, stores them in a list, constructs a message with system info and tokens, then sends this data via a network request to the webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable and function names, dynamic string concatenation, regex pattern matching for tokens, silent exception handling during network requests, and hardcoded webhook URL suggest malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script targets directories associated with Discord and browsers, searches for token-like strings using regex, and exfiltrates any found tokens to an external webhook. Obfuscated naming and dynamic string assembly are used to hide its purpose. The code performs credential harvesting without user consent, with minimal error handling, indicating malicious behavior. The patterns match known Discord token formats, and the exfiltration is consistent with credential theft malware. The code contains no legitimate functionality, and the exfiltration to a hardcoded URL confirms malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a credential-stealing malware designed to harvest Discord and browser tokens from local storage and exfiltrate them via a webhook. Its obfuscation, pattern matching, and silent network requests confirm malicious behavior with high confidence. The malware score is 1.0, security risk is 1.0, and obfuscation is high but not maximal, with a score of 0.8.",
