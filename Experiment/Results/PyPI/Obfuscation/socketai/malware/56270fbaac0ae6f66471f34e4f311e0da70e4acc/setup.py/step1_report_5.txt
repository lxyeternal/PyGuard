  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python project, specifying package metadata and build requirements.",
  "sources": "Import statement for setuptools, assignment of version string",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks detected",
  "flows": "No significant data flows; the code only imports and assigns variables, then calls setup()",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable name 'sMXNbHlSlzKppViPrBfWZoDwmPtliSah' instead of a meaningful name; no other suspicious activity",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setup' and 'find_packages' from 'setuptools', assigns a version string to a variable with an obfuscated name, and calls setup() with only name and setup_requires parameters. No input handling, no external data sources, no suspicious logic or commands. The obfuscated variable name appears to serve no clear purpose, which may indicate obfuscation or concealment, but it does not execute malicious behavior. The setup call is minimal and standard for packaging, with no harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a basic setup configuration with obfuscated variable naming. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be benign, likely part of a package build process.",
