  "purpose": "Define and configure the setup process for a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Imports 'setuptools' and the variable assignment for version.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output operations present.",
  "flows": "Import leads to setup invocation, no user input flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "Use of an obscure variable name ('sMXNbHlSlzKppViPrBfWZoDwmPtliSah') for version; no descriptive naming.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools', defines a version string with a non-descriptive variable name, and calls 'setup()' with only the package name and setup_requires. No user input, data processing, or external network operations are present. The obfuscated variable name for version might be an attempt to hide or obscure information, but it does not execute malicious actions. Overall, the code is minimal, typical for a setup script, with no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script with an unusual variable name for version. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident based on this fragment.",
