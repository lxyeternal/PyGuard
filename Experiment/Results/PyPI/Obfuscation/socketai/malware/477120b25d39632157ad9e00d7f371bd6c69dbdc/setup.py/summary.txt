  "conclusion": "The code contains a high suspicion of malicious activity due to execution of an encoded, hidden PowerShell command during setup. The stealth and obfuscation techniques used are typical of malicious payloads. While definitive confirmation requires decoding the command, the current evidence warrants high security concern and caution."
