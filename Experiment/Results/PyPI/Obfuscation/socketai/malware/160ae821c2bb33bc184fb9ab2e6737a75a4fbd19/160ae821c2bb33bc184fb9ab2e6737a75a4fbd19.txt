      "conclusion": "The code contains high suspicion of malicious activity due to the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command triggered conditionally during package setup. The behavior aligns with typical malware or backdoor tactics, warranting high malware and risk scores. While the actual payload is unknown, the obfuscation and concealment justify treating this as a high-severity security concern."
