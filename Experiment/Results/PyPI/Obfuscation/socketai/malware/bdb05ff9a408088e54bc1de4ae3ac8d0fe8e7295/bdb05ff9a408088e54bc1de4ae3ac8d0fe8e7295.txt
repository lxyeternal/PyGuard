      "conclusion": "The code is benign with a minor anomaly—a non-standard, random-looking key—that does not pose a security threat. The scores are appropriate and reflect the lack of malicious or harmful behavior. No further action is necessary, but verifying the purpose of the unusual key with the package maintainer is recommended."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits covert data exfiltration behavior without executing malicious payloads. While not outright malware, it poses significant privacy and security risks. The behavior warrants a high security concern, with a malware score around 0.4 and risk score approximately 0.75, reflecting moderate suspicion and high privacy invasion potential."
