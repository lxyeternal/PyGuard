  "conclusion": "The code is a credential-stealing malware that impersonates system prompts across platforms, exfiltrates sensitive data, and marks infected systems. Its behaviors are malicious and consistent with malware activity. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 1.0, obfuscated: 0.8, security risk: 1.0) are appropriate and should be maintained."
