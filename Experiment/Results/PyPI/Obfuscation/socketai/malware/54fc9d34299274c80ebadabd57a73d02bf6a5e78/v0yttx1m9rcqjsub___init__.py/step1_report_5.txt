{
  "purpose": "The code imports modules from the 'safepackage' library, likely for general use within a larger project.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the 'safepackage' package modules 'Confused' and 'calc'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks are evident in this snippet; no untrusted data handling or output is shown.",
  "flows": "The imports establish a flow where 'Confused' and 'calc' modules can be used later, but no execution or data flow is shown in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports (*) can hide imported symbols, potentially masking malicious or unsafe code or hiding the true nature of imported functions. However, this alone isn't necessarily malicious.",
  "analysis": "The snippet consists solely of two import statements with wildcard imports from a package named 'safepackage'. No code execution, data handling, or suspicious patterns are present. The import statements do not reveal any malicious intent on their own; however, wildcard imports are generally discouraged as they obscure what symbols are being imported, potentially hiding malicious functions or variables. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscation. Without additional context or code, it's not possible to definitively determine malicious intent, but based on this fragment alone, the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code only imports modules from a package, with no evident malicious behavior or security risks. The use of wildcard imports is a concern for maintainability and clarity but not inherently malicious. No immediate security threats are identified.",
