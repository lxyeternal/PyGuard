  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and reasoning.\n\n**Code under review:**\n```python\nfrom safepackage.Confused import *\nfrom safepackage.calc import *\n```\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues in the Code:\n- The code performs wildcard imports (`import *`) from two modules within `safepackage`.  \n- No direct malicious activity, data leaks, or obfuscated code are visible in this snippet.  \n- The code does not execute any functions or process data; it only imports modules.\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws in the Reports:\n- All reports correctly identify the use of `import *` as a bad practice due to obscurity.  \n- They also note that no malicious activity is evident from these import statements alone.  \n- The reports sometimes suggest further review of the modules themselves, which is prudent, but this is outside the scope of the current snippet.\n\n### Evaluation of the Report Scores:\n- **Confidence:** Ranges from 0.6 to 0.7, which seems reasonable given the limited context.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the straightforward import statements.  \n- **Malware:** 0 in all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious indicators in this snippet.  \n- **Security Risk:** Slightly higher (0.2 or 0.4) in some reports, reflecting the concern about `import *` hiding potential malicious code. This is reasonable but not alarming.\n\n### Specific Points:\n- **Malware Score:** All zeroes are justified; no evidence of malicious code is present.  \n- **Obfuscated:** Zero, since the code is clear and straightforward, aside from the use of `import *`.  \n- **Risk Score:** Given the use of wildcard imports, a small risk score (0.2) is appropriate, but not higher, unless there's evidence of malicious modules.\n\n### Critical Observations:\n- The reports are consistent with each other and with the code.  \n- No report claims or implies malicious activity based solely on these import statements.  \n- The main concern is the pattern of wildcard imports, which could conceal malicious functions if present in the modules, but this cannot be confirmed here.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation, just wildcard imports)  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 (due to poor practice, potential to hide malicious code, but no direct evidence)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are generally accurate and cautious. The use of `import *` is a security concern but not inherently malicious. The scores reflect this well. Without additional context or module inspection, there's no reason to escalate the risk or malware scores.\n\n---\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \n- The code snippet is benign but poorly written from a best practices perspective.  \n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.  \n- Further review of the actual `safepackage` modules would be necessary to confirm the absence of malicious functions.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores:  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and best security practices.",
