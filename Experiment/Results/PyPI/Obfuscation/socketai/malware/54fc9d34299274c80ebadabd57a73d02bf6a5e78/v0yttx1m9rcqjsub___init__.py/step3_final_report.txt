{
  "purpose": "The code imports all symbols from safepackage.Confused and safepackage.calc modules, likely to use their functionalities.",
  "sources": "Import statements from safepackage.Confused and safepackage.calc modules",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present in the snippet; only module imports",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow beyond imports; no functions invoked or data processed",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports ('import *'), which can obscure imported symbols and potentially hide malicious functions",
  "analysis": "The code only contains import statements with no further code execution. The use of 'import *' is discouraged as it reduces code clarity and can conceal malicious functions if present. No evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or data leaks is visible in this snippet. The scores assigned by the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0.2-0.4) are consistent with the cautious stance due to import style. Further review of the actual modules is recommended to ensure they do not contain hidden malicious functions, but based solely on this snippet, the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign in isolation, with no malicious activity or obfuscation evident. The primary concern is the use of wildcard imports, which warrants further inspection of the modules themselves. The assigned scores are appropriate given the evidence.",
