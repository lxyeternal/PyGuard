  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet:\n\n```python\nfrom safepackage.Confused import *\nfrom safepackage.calc import *\n```\n\n**Step 1: Are the reported issues present?**  \nAll reports highlight the use of `import *` from modules within `safepackage`. This pattern is consistent across all reports.\n\n**Step 2: Are there any errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n- The primary concern is the use of wildcard imports (`import *`), which are discouraged because they obscure which symbols are imported, making the code harder to analyze and potentially hiding malicious functions.  \n- No direct malicious activity, data leaks, or obfuscated code are evident in this snippet.\n\n**Step 3: Are the scores reasonable?**  \n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of direct malicious activity in the snippet.  \n- Security risk scores are low (around 0.2–0.4), reflecting the caution due to wildcard imports but no confirmed malicious behavior.  \n- Confidence levels are moderate (0.6–0.7), appropriate given the limited context.\n\n**Step 4: Justify higher risk or malware scores?**  \n- Since no actual malicious code, data flow, or suspicious behavior is visible, scores of 0 for malware are justified.  \n- The use of `import *` warrants caution, but without evidence of malicious functions, the risk remains low.\n\n**Step 5: Are any claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions?**  \n- The reports correctly identify that wildcard imports can hide malicious functions, but they do not assume malicious activity exists—only that the pattern warrants caution.\n\n**Step 6: Consistency of scores with the report?**  \n- The scores are consistent with the analysis: no malware, low security risk, but a note on the potential danger of wildcard imports.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — no evidence of malicious code.  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.  \n**Risk score:** 0.2 — low, mainly due to poor coding practice rather than malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall recommendation:\n\nWhile the current code snippet appears benign, the pattern of wildcard imports from potentially unknown modules warrants further review of the actual contents of `safepackage.Confused` and `safepackage.calc`. If these modules contain malicious functions or hidden code, the risk could increase.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 (due to poor coding practice but no active threat)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code snippet itself is not malicious. The main concern is the use of wildcard imports, which should be replaced with explicit imports for clarity and security. Further inspection of the modules is recommended to confirm their safety.",
