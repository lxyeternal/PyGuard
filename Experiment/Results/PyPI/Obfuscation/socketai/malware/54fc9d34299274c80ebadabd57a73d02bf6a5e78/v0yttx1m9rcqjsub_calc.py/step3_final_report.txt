  "purpose": "Simple addition function with an obfuscated name",
  "sources": "Function parameters x and y",
  "sinks": "None; no external data or network activity",
  "flows": "Input parameters x and y flow directly into the return statement",
  "anomalies": "Function name appears obfuscated or nonsensical, but code is straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code performs a basic addition with no external dependencies or suspicious operations. The function name is obfuscated, which could suggest concealment, but the logic is benign. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, with some assigning higher obfuscation scores due to the nonsensical name. Malware scores are consistently zero, and security risks are minimal. The obfuscation scores vary but are justified by the naming. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a trivial, benign addition function with obfuscated naming. No malicious behavior or security risks are present. The scoring in the reports aligns with the code's characteristics, and no modifications are necessary.",
