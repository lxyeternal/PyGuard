  "purpose": "Simple function to add two inputs",
  "sources": "Function parameters x and y",
  "sinks": "Return statement outputs the sum",
  "flows": "Input parameters x and y flow directly to the return statement",
  "anomalies": "Function name is an obfuscated string, but the code itself is straightforward addition; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function with an obfuscated name that takes two parameters and returns their sum. There are no external data sources, no use of environment variables, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The code appears to be a simple utility function without malicious intent. The obfuscated name could be intended to hide purpose, but the code logic itself is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a basic addition operation with an obfuscated function name. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The function's simplicity suggests it is unlikely to be malicious.",
