  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; function performs basic addition.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function with a seemingly random name that takes two inputs and returns their sum. There are no external data reads, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors. The function appears straightforward and benign. The function name appears obfuscated but does not indicate malicious intent; it may be auto-generated or deliberately obscure. No external or network activity is present. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or malware indicators are evident in this small snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign addition function with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscated name does not imply malicious intent; it appears to be an innocuous utility.",
