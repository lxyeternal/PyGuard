  "purpose": "Simple addition function returning the sum of two inputs",
  "sources": "Function parameters x and y (inputs to the function)",
  "sinks": "Return statement outputs the result; no external data sinks observed",
  "flows": "Input parameters x and y flow into the addition operation, and the result is returned",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and uses simple arithmetic",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function with a seemingly random name that takes two parameters and returns their sum. There is no evidence of data leakage, hardcoded credentials, external network activity, or obfuscated code. The function performs a basic arithmetic operation without side effects or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a basic, benign function performing addition with no malicious intent or security risks.",
