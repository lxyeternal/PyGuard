  "purpose": "Simple addition function to return the sum of two inputs",
  "sources": "Input parameters x and y",
  "sinks": "Return statement, which outputs the sum",
  "flows": "Input x and y are received, processed by addition, output returned",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code structures observed; function name appears random but does not imply malicious intent",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function with a non-descriptive, seemingly random name that takes two parameters and returns their sum. There are no external data reads, no use of environment variables, network connections, or system calls. No suspicious operations, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present. The function's simplicity indicates it is a straightforward addition utility without malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign, simple addition function with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
