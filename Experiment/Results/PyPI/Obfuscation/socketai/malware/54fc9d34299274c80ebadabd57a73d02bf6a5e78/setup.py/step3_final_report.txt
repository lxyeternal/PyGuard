  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging a module, reading README.md for description, and defining package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file, static variables for package info, import statements, call to setup()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, no network calls, no code injection, no external data transmission",
  "flows": "Reading local file -> passing static metadata to setup()",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated variable names, but no malicious code or suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with obfuscated variable names. It reads a local README file safely, defines package metadata, and calls setup() with standard parameters. No network activity, data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious logic is present. The obfuscation appears solely to hinder readability, not to conceal malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious behavior and assign a malware score of 0. The obfuscation score is high (~0.75), which is justified given the variable names. The security risk score is minimal (~0.1), consistent with the benign nature of the script. No discrepancies or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. The high obfuscation does not imply malicious activity, and the overall security assessment should remain low. The current scores are appropriate and justified.",
