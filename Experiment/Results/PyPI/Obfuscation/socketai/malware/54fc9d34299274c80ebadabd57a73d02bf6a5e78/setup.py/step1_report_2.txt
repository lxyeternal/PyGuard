  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python project, defining metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "File system read for 'README.md', static strings for package version and name, and the 'install_requires' list.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; setup process is standard.",
  "anomalies": "The variable names are obfuscated and nonsensical, which is unusual for a setup script. No suspicious code execution, code injection, or obfuscated logic detected beyond obfuscated variable names. The code reads a README file but does not process any user input or network data.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a standard package setup using 'setuptools', with obfuscated variable names that do not impact functionality. It loads a README file for description and specifies package metadata and dependencies. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The obfuscation appears to be solely for confusing reading, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with obfuscated variable names. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior is evident. The script's purpose is clear: package configuration, with no indications of security risks.",
