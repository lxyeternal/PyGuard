{
  "purpose": "The code defines and calls a function that prints 'installed'.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; the only data source is the hardcoded string in the print statement.",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs data to the console; no untrusted data or external communication occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the function executes a static print statement.",
  "anomalies": "The function name is obfuscated and unusually long, which can be a sign of attempting to hide intent. No other suspicious code or behavior is present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function with an obfuscated name that simply prints a static message and then calls that function. There are no external inputs, network activity, or data manipulation. The obfuscation could be an attempt to hide simple behavior, but there is no evidence of malicious activity or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and does not contain malicious behavior. The obfuscated naming is suspicious but not inherently malicious; it appears to be a trivial script with no security risks.",
