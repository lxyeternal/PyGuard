{
  "purpose": "The function prints a message indicating installation or execution confirmation.",
  "sources": "The function reads no external input; it only executes a print statement.",
  "sinks": "The code executes a print statement, which has no malicious effect or data leakage.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; only a simple print statement is executed.",
  "anomalies": "The function name appears obfuscated and does nothing meaningful beyond printing a message. There are no other suspicious behaviors or hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function with an obfuscated name that simply prints a static message 'installed'. The function is immediately invoked after definition. There are no external inputs, no data processing, no network connections, or malicious operations. The obfuscated function name might suggest an attempt to conceal its purpose, but given its trivial content, it appears harmless. No signs of malicious intent, such as data theft, backdoors, or malicious commands, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign; it merely prints a message and does not perform any malicious actions or pose security risks.",
