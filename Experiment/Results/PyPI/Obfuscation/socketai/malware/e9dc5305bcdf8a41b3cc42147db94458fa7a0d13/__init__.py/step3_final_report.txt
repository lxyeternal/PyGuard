{
  "purpose": "The code defines a function with an obfuscated name that prints 'installed' and calls it immediately.",
  "sources": "No external inputs, data flows, or network activity; only a function call.",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs static data; no untrusted data or external communication occurs.",
  "flows": "Function definition (source) directly leads to its invocation (sink) with no data manipulation or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function name; no malicious or suspicious code behavior; trivial print statement.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, benign script with an obfuscated function name that prints a static message. No external data, network activity, or malicious payloads are present. The obfuscation appears superficial and intended to conceal purpose but does not indicate malicious intent. The malware score should be 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting minimal threat. Confidence in this assessment is high (close to 1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation alone does not elevate concern given the trivial functionality. Scores are consistent with the analysis, with malware=0, obfuscated=0.6, risk=0.1.",
