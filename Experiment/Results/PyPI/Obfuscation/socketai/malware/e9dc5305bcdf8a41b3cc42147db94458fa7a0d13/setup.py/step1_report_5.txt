{
  "purpose": "The code appears to modify the installation process of a Python package to include malicious behavior, specifically downloading and executing a potentially harmful file from an external URL during installation.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', HTTP GET requests to external URLs, reading content from these URLs",
  "sinks": "Writing a downloaded file to disk and executing it via os.system('start ...')",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' -> requests.get to external URL -> download content -> save to file -> os.system to execute the file",
  "anomalies": "The code fetches data from a remote server using the environment variable, downloads an executable, and executes it without any validation, all within a try-except block that suppresses errors. The URL 'https://python-release.com/python-install.scr' and 'https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php...' are suspicious and potentially malicious domains. The code runs on Windows platform specifically, and executes downloaded files directly, which is a common tactic in malware delivery.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing necessary modules and defining a function 'bHZWsHiFZqJxoMOlKithkWcCksXvwZcO' that attempts to read the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable. It then sends a GET request to a remote URL, appending this environment variable, and on Windows systems, downloads and executes an executable file from a suspicious URL. The class 'KhHhRxtuJXblCOwqzmRvPNfZPrbFkhvI' extends the 'install' class, overriding the 'install' method to call the malicious function during package installation. The setup configuration specifies the package name, version, and custom install command. All of these behaviors—remote code fetching, executing downloaded files, and hiding actions behind a try-except—are typical of malicious package behavior designed to infect systems during installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious. It secretly downloads and executes a file during package installation, likely to infect or control the target system. Its suspicious URLs, use of environment variables, and execution of remote content point to a malicious intent.",
