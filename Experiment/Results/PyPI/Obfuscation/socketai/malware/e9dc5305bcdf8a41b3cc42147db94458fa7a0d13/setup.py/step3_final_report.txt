{
  "purpose": "The code attempts to exfiltrate system information, download, and execute a remote payload during package installation, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME'; making HTTP GET requests to external URLs; downloading files from 'linkedopports.com' and 'python-release.com'; executing downloaded files via os.system.",
  "sinks": "Executing downloaded executable with os.system; potential for remote code execution and system compromise.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' is sent to a remote server; a file is downloaded from a suspicious URL; the file is executed via os.system, leading to potential malicious payload execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated function and variable names; broad try-except blocks suppress errors; downloading and executing external files during setup without validation; contacting suspicious domains.",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves system info, contacts external servers, downloads an executable, and runs it without validation, all during package installation. Obfuscated naming and error suppression conceal malicious activity. These behaviors align with typical malware tactics such as remote payload delivery and system compromise. The external URLs are suspicious, and executing downloaded files without integrity checks poses a high security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential, including remote code execution and data exfiltration, with obfuscation to conceal intent. It should be classified as malware with maximum severity and flagged for removal.",
