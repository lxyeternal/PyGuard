  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is a minimal setup script using setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies.\n- The variable 'AnWyUfdArjgNIcratqunDpvtgjGRzNNG' is used to store the version string, which appears obfuscated or randomly generated.\n- The package name 'm9x35xrsul2nwnhk' is non-descriptive and likely obfuscated.\n- Dependencies include 'browser_cookie3', 'discordwebhook', 'robloxpy', and 'requests'.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- The code itself is syntactically correct and performs a standard setup operation.\n- No malicious code, network activity, or data processing is present within this snippet.\n- The obfuscated variable and package names are unusual but not inherently malicious.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- The main concern is obfuscation: the variable name and package name are intentionally obscure, which could be an attempt to hide malicious intent.\n- No actual malicious behavior is demonstrated in this code snippet.\n- The dependencies could be misused in other parts of the project for malicious purposes, but their mere presence is not suspicious.\n\n### Score review and justification:\n\n#### Malware Score:\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0 or very low (0.1–0.2).\n- **Justification:** The code contains no malicious payload, no code execution, or network activity. The dependencies could be misused elsewhere, but there's no evidence here.\n- **Conclusion:** Malware score should remain **0**.\n\n#### Obfuscated Score:\n- The variable name and package name are intentionally obfuscated or random.\n- **Scores range from 0.2 to 0.6.** Given the obfuscation, a score of around **0.4 to 0.6** seems justified.\n- **Consensus:** Keep the obfuscated score at **0.5** to reflect moderate obfuscation.\n\n#### Risk Score:\n- The reports assign a risk score between 0.2 and 0.3.\n- **Justification:** The code is benign on its own but uses dependencies that could be misused for malicious activities like data exfiltration or command-and-control if integrated into a malicious package.\n- **However,** since this is only a setup script with no active malicious behavior, a conservative risk score of **0.2** is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n| Score Type      | Suggested Value | Justification                                              |\n|-----------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | **0**           | No malicious code or behavior present.                        |\n| Obfuscated      | **0.5**         | Variable and package names are obfuscated, moderate suspicion. |\n| Security Risk   | **0.2**         | Standard setup with dependencies; no active malicious actions. |\n\n---\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The obfuscation could be an attempt to conceal malicious intent, so further investigation into the full codebase is recommended.\n- The dependencies should be reviewed for malicious misuse if the package is deployed or used in production.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code appears benign in isolation, with obfuscation as the primary concern. The scores should reflect that, with malware at zero, moderate obfuscation, and low security risk.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**  \n- Malware: **0**  \n- Obfuscated: **0.5**  \n- Risk: **0.2**",
