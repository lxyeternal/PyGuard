  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package with specific dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading from the import statement, package name, version string, and setup() parameters.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; setup dependencies are not malicious by themselves.",
  "flows": "Import statement to setup configuration; dependencies list to package installation.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable name 'AnWyUfdArjgNIcratqunDpvtgjGRzNNG' instead of a conventional variable; no other suspicious code activities.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setup' and 'find_packages' from setuptools, then defines a version string with an obfuscated variable name. It calls setup() with a package name, version, and a list of dependencies: 'browser_cookie3', 'discordwebhook', 'robloxpy', 'requests'. The dependencies include modules that could be used for automation, data retrieval, or webhook notifications, but their presence alone is not malicious. The variable name appears intentionally obfuscated, which could suggest an attempt to hide purpose, but without further code, no malicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily performs a standard package setup with dependencies. There are no direct signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The obfuscated variable name is unusual but does not alone indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code appears to be a benign setup script with dependencies that could be used in various automation or integration tasks.",
