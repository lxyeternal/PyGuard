{
  "purpose": "Set up and install required dependencies for a Python package named 'm9x35xrsul2nwnhk'.",
  "sources": "The 'setup' function call from setuptools and the variable defining the version.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; the code only defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving user input or external data beyond dependency specification.",
  "anomalies": "Use of an obscure variable name ('AnWyUfdArjgNIcratqunDpvtgjGRzNNG') instead of standard 'version' or similar. The package name appears random, which can be suspicious but is not conclusive. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setup' and 'find_packages' from setuptools to define package configuration. It sets a version string in a uniquely named variable, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. The 'setup' function is called with a package name that appears obfuscated and includes a list of dependencies such as 'browser_cookie3', 'discordwebhook', 'robloxpy', and 'requests'. These dependencies could be used for a variety of purposes, including data collection or automation. There are no code execution, network calls, or other malicious actions in this fragment. The code is minimal and typical of a setup script, but the obfuscated package name and variable name are suspicious and warrant further review if part of a larger codebase.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script with obfuscated naming, which could be a tactic to conceal malicious intent. On its own, it does not perform malicious actions or data leaks but could be part of a package that facilitates such behavior. Due to obfuscation and dependency choices, a higher suspicion score is warranted pending further investigation.",
