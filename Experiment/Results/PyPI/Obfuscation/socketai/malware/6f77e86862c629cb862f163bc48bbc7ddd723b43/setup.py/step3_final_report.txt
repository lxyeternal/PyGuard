{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Python package setup configuration with obfuscated identifiers and dependencies that could be misused for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the 'setuptools' module and uses hardcoded package name, version string, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the dependencies ('browser_cookie3', 'discordwebhook', 'robloxpy', 'requests') which could be exploited for data exfiltration or automation misuse if misused elsewhere.",
  "flows": "The setup script initializes package metadata and dependencies; no active data flow or malicious activity occurs within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable name for version ('AnWyUfdArjgNIcratqunDpvtgjGRzNNG') and non-descriptive package name ('m9x35xrsul2nwnhk') are suspicious anomalies indicating possible concealment.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, syntactically correct setup script that imports 'setuptools', assigns an obfuscated version variable, and calls 'setup()' with a non-descriptive package name and dependencies. No malicious code, network activity, or data leaks are present. The obfuscated identifiers raise suspicion but do not demonstrate malicious intent. The dependencies are common but could be misused if incorporated into malicious workflows. Malware scores are low (around 0.1), reflecting no active malicious payloads. Obfuscation scores are moderate (~0.4) due to naming, and security risk scores are low (~0.2). The overall assessment indicates benign code with potential for misuse if part of a larger malicious package, warranting cautious review but no immediate threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with obfuscated identifiers and dependencies that could be misused. No active malicious behavior is evident. Malware score is 0.1, obfuscation score is 0.4, and security risk is 0.2, reflecting low threat but highlighting obfuscation as a concern.",
