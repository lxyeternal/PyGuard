      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated or malformed setup script that does not perform malicious actions but raises suspicion due to its irregular structure. The malware score is appropriately zero, with high obfuscation and moderate risk scores reflecting caution. Further verification of the source and static/dynamic analysis are recommended before trusting or deploying this package."

      "confidence": 0.85,
      "conclusion": "The reports are consistent and appropriately score the dependency's security posture based on the described patterns. The highest concern lies with obfuscation and dynamic code execution, warranting a malware score around 0.45-0.5 and an obfuscation score near 0.6. Further code analysis is recommended to confirm malicious behavior. Current scores are justified and aligned with the evidence presented."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious, exhibiting heavy obfuscation and dynamic execution of decoded payloads, indicative of malicious or backdoor behavior. The use of exec() on decoded data, combined with environment and file manipulations, warrants a high security concern."
