  "conclusion": "The reports are consistent and appropriately score the dependency's security posture based on the described patterns. The highest concern lies with obfuscation and dynamic code execution, warranting a malware score around 0.45-0.5 and an obfuscation score near 0.6. Further code analysis is recommended to confirm malicious behavior. Current scores are justified and aligned with the evidence presented."
