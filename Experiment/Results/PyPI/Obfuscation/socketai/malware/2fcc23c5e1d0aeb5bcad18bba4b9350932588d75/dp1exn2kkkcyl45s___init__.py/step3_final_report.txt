  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Use of eval()/exec() with untrusted input, environment variables, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated strings, dynamic imports, suspicious URLs or commands.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks via environment variables, network communication, or file operations; execution of dynamically generated code; obfuscated code execution.",
  "flows": "Sources such as untrusted input or environment variables feed into eval()/exec() or dynamic imports, leading to potential malicious actions or data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic execution functions with untrusted data, high obfuscation scores, suspicious strings or URLs, inconsistent or high obfuscation levels, and patterns typical of malicious obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The reports consistently identify dynamic code execution, obfuscation, and suspicious patterns. Scores are generally aligned with the described behaviors: moderate obfuscation (around 0.3-0.8), moderate malware suspicion (0.2-0.6), and security risks (0.45-0.6). Reports 1 and 5 are the most concerning, indicating potential malicious intent due to obfuscation and dynamic execution. The absence of code in some reports justifies zero scores. Overall, the assessments are reasonable, but given the suspicion levels, an adjusted malware score of approximately 0.45 and obfuscation around 0.6 better reflect the potential threat, especially if dynamic execution is confirmed with untrusted input.",
  "conclusion": "The reports are consistent and appropriately score the dependency's security posture based on the described patterns. The highest concern lies with obfuscation and dynamic code execution, warranting a malware score around 0.45-0.5 and an obfuscation score near 0.6. Further code analysis is recommended to confirm malicious behavior. Current scores are justified and aligned with the evidence presented.",
