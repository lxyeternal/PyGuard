{
  "purpose": "This code is intended to configure package metadata for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it defines static package metadata within the setup() call.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data flows; the code does not process external data or perform actions beyond defining metadata.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is declarative and static.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated attribute names ('EIpoXromsaECojUwLvyIbqcmzitcrXop', 'ZeIOqIwwLyZpiWFXAVQLbwTbATnIIwpg') that do not conform to setuptools standards; invalid arguments outside valid parameter context; potential syntax errors if executed as-is.",
  "analysis": "The code contains nonsensical attribute names and malformed arguments, indicating obfuscation or corruption. All reports correctly identify these irregularities and note the absence of malicious actions. The malware score remains at 0, consistent with no active malicious code. The obfuscation scores are high (~0.7), reflecting suspicion, and security risk scores are moderate (~0.2-0.3), acknowledging potential issues due to malformed arguments but no confirmed threats. The code's obfuscation and syntax irregularities suggest an attempt to hide intent or dependencies, warranting caution. However, without evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration, the overall threat remains low.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated or malformed setup script that does not perform malicious actions but raises suspicion due to its irregular structure. The malware score is appropriately zero, with high obfuscation and moderate risk scores reflecting caution. Further verification of the source and static/dynamic analysis are recommended before trusting or deploying this package.",
