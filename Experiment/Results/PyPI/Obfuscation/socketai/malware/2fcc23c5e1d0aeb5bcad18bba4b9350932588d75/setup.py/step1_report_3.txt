  "anomalies": [
    "Presence of random-looking, non-descriptive parameter names such as EIpoXromsaECojUwLvyIbqcmzitcrXop and ZeIOqIwwLyZpiWFXAVQLbwTbATnIIwpg which do not correspond to standard setuptools parameters",
    "Parameter EIpoXromsaECojUwLvyIbqcmzitcrXop assigned 'text/markdown' instead of a recognized keyword (e.g., 'long_description')",
    "Parameter ZeIOqIwwLyZpiWFXAVQLbwTbATnIIwpg set to an empty list, which is unusual and likely invalid as a keyword argument",
    "The use of non-standard or invalid keyword argument names suggests obfuscation or tampering"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a typical setup script for packaging, but the use of nonsensical, random variable names and improper parameters indicates potential obfuscation or an attempt to hide malicious intent. The script does not contain any dynamic code execution, external data handling, or suspicious operations. However, the unusual parameter names and values raise suspicion about its integrity or purpose, possibly indicating malicious obfuscation or malformed code.",
  "conclusion": "The script is an obfuscated or malformed setup configuration with no clear malicious behavior or malware evident. The suspicious parameter names and incorrect usage suggest it may be intentionally obfuscated or corrupted, which warrants caution. No active malicious actions are detected, but the structure is suspicious.",
