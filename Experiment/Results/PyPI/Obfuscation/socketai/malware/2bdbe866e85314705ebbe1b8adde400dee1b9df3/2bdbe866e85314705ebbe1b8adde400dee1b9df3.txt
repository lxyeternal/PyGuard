      "conclusion": "The code exhibits behaviors typical of malicious payload delivery—obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during setup—raising high suspicion of malicious intent. The silent error handling further conceals potential malicious activity. Scores assigned are consistent with these observations. It is recommended to treat this package as malicious or compromised until the payload can be decoded and verified."
