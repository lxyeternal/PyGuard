  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, if obfuscated, proxy management implementation. No direct malicious activity or payloads are detected. Obfuscation and proxy chaining could be exploited maliciously, but current evidence does not confirm such intent. Continuous monitoring is advised if deployed in sensitive environments."
