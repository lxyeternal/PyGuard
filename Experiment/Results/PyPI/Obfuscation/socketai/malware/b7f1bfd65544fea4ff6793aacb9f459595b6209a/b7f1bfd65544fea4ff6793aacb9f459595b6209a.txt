      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, if obfuscated, proxy management utility with no evidence of malicious behavior. The obfuscation and deprecated functions warrant caution but are not conclusive of malicious intent. Overall, the security risk is low, and the malware score should remain at 0.1 to reflect slight suspicion due to obfuscation but no active threats."

Obfuscation and proxy chaining could be exploited maliciously, but current evidence does not confirm such intent. Continuous monitoring is advised if deployed in sensitive environments."

While variable obfuscation and flexible proxy handling could be exploited, there is no evidence of malicious payloads or backdoors. The overall security risk is low, and malware presence is absent."
