{
  "purpose": "The code defines a deprecated warning for SOCKS proxy connector and implements a subclass for handling proxy connections with support for different SOCKS versions.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration parameters for proxy type and version, and calls a superclass constructor with these parameters.",
  "sinks": "Superclass constructor invocation, particularly when passing proxy type and version; potentially vulnerable if untrusted data influences these parameters.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., 'socks_ver', 'proxy_type', 'url') flow into constructor calls and class methods, affecting network connection setup.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated functions with warnings, no hardcoded secrets or credentials, class inheritance with dynamic proxy type, and the use of external proxy error classes. The warning function uses a non-standard keyword argument 'oAgWgYrXwygIQXxJzfkEVfAAWPmRlUTv' which is unusual but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard proxy error classes and a third-party socks library. It defines a deprecation warning function that notifies users about a deprecated connector. The main class extends a presumably external class, configuring proxy types based on SOCKS version, with a class method for proxy URL handling. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are evident. The use of dynamic proxy type configuration is typical for proxy handling code. No code injection, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are detected. The code appears to be legitimate, focusing on proxy management with deprecation warnings.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard proxy connection handler with deprecated warnings and flexible configuration. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The code seems legitimate and safe for use, assuming the superclass and imported modules are also secure.",
