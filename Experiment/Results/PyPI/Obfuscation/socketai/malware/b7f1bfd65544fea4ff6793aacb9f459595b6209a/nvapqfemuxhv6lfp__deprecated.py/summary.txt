  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, if obfuscated, proxy management utility with no evidence of malicious behavior. The obfuscation and deprecated functions warrant caution but are not conclusive of malicious intent. Overall, the security risk is low, and the malware score should remain at 0.1 to reflect slight suspicion due to obfuscation but no active threats."
