{
  "purpose": "This code provides a wrapper class for managing SOCKS proxy connections using the python_socks library, with a deprecated warning for an older connector function.",
  "sources": "Imports warnings, python_socks classes, and a relative connector module; reads input parameters during class initialization and method calls.",
  "sinks": "Super constructor calls and method invocations could use untrusted data if supplied externally; no direct data leaks or harmful actions are evident.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (such as 'socks_ver' and 'url') flow into class constructors and methods, influencing proxy configuration and connection setup.",
  "anomalies": "The class name and variable names are obfuscated or nonsensical, indicating potential code obfuscation. The deprecated warning suggests legacy code use. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a deprecated warning, an obfuscated class with class-level variables, and a proxy connector subclass that initializes with optional proxy version settings. The use of 'warnings.warn' indicates an effort to phase out old functionality. The class methods and constructors delegate to parent classes, passing parameters that could influence network connections. No evidence of malicious data handling, backdoors, or suspicious network activity is present. Obfuscation appears intentional but benign, likely to deter casual inspection. No hardcoded credentials or malicious network connections are found.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, albeit obfuscated, proxy connector implementation with deprecation notices. No malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks are evident based on static analysis. It mainly manages proxy configurations and warns about deprecated functionality.",
