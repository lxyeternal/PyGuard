  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code snippet, and evaluate the scores and claims.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code is primarily composed of import statements and the `__all__` declaration.\n- No functions, data processing, or network operations are present in the snippet.\n- Variable names are obfuscated (e.g., yOzSQnfhUBqUizYKASZHNSdDqDGHrZsW), but this is common in package code, especially in `__init__.py` files.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns are evident.\n- The code imports from well-known libraries (`python_socks`) and internal modules, exposing a public API.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of each report:**\n\n#### **Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Proxy connection module, no malicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.3\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly identifies the code as benign, mainly import/export setup. The obfuscation is superficial. Malware score is appropriately zero. The confidence is high, given the lack of suspicious activity.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Proxy management, SOCKS proxies, standard package setup.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.6\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the report correctly notes the code's benign nature. The obfuscation is more significant here but still not indicative of malicious intent. Malware score remains zero, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Proxy connection setup, public API exposure.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.2\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe analysis is consistent. Obfuscation is minimal, and no malicious activity is suspected. The malware score remains zero, aligning with the code.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Proxy handling, network operations.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.5\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly states that no malicious behavior is evident. The obfuscation level is moderate but not suspicious. Malware score is zero.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Proxy management, connection handling.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.3\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the assessment aligns with the code. No signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of all reports:**\n\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** None. All reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- **Obfuscation:** Variable names are obfuscated but this is typical for package code and does not imply malicious intent.\n- **Malware score:** Consistently zero across all reports, which is appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, as the code is only import/export setup.\n\n---\n\n### **Final expert evaluation:**\n\n**Malware score:**  \nGiven the code snippet, I agree with a malware score of **0**. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n\n**Obfuscated score:**  \nThe obfuscation level varies but is not inherently malicious. I would rate it around **0.2 to 0.3**, consistent with the reports.\n\n**Risk score:**  \nThe overall security risk remains very low, around **0.1 to 0.2**, as no malicious or vulnerable behavior is detected.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n- The reports are consistent with the code snippet.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable.\n- The obfuscation is superficial and does not indicate malicious intent.\n- The malware score should remain at **0**.\n- The overall security risk remains minimal.\n\n**My final estimates:**\n\n| Metric            | Score |\n|-------------------|--------|\n| Malware           | **0** |\n| Obfuscated        | **0.2** |\n| Security Risk     | **0.1** |\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is a benign module setup for proxy handling with no security concerns.",
