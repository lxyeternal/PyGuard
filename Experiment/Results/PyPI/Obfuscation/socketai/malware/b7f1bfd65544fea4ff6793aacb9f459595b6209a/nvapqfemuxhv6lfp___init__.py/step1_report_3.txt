{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a Python package related to proxy connections, specifically handling SOCKS proxies via the 'python_socks' library and internal modules for connection management.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'python_socks', internal modules (.connector, .utils, ._deprecated), and variable assignments for package name and version.",
  "sinks": "Exports of functions, classes, and constants such as '__title__', '__version__', 'ProxyConnector', 'ChainProxyConnector', etc., which may be used elsewhere in applications.",
  "flows": "The code imports dependencies, assigns package information, and exposes certain classes and functions for external use. No data flows from untrusted sources to critical functions within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses obfuscated variable names (e.g., yOzSQnfhUBqUizYKASZHNSdDqDGHrZsW), but this is common in package code and does not necessarily indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical module setup for a Python package, importing necessary dependencies and re-exporting symbols. The obfuscated variable names seem to serve as internal package identifiers. There are no signs of malicious code, data leakage, or security flaws. No external data sources or untrusted inputs are processed here. The structure indicates standard package export conventions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard part of a Python proxy connection library with no evident malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation appears superficial and does not suggest malware or sabotage. It is safe based on the provided fragment.",
