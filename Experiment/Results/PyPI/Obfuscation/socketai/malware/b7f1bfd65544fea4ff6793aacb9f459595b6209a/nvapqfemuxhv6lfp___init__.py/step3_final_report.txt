{
  "purpose": "Module setup and API exposure for proxy management, importing necessary classes and functions.",
  "sources": "Import statements from external libraries (python_socks) and internal modules (.connector, .utils, ._deprecated).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; code does not process input or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "Importing symbols and exposing them via __all__; no data flow or execution logic present.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names assigned to string literals; no suspicious code patterns or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard package initialization file with import statements and an __all__ declaration. Variable names are obfuscated but do not perform malicious actions. No network activity, data handling, or dynamic code execution is present. The obfuscation appears superficial, typical of minimized or generated code. No signs of malware, backdoors, or vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, low risk, moderate obfuscation) are consistent with the benign nature of this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a module initializer for proxy-related functionalities. There is no malicious behavior or security risk detected. Obfuscation is superficial and does not imply malicious intent. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
