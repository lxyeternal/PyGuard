  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package with potentially malicious code embedded.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file, executing 'os.popen' commands, constructing URL with base64-encoded system info, and calling 'os.system' with the URL.",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing a curl command to a remote server with encoded system info.",
  "flows": "Reads system info -> encodes info in base64 -> constructs URL with encoded data -> sends data via curl to remote server.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of code that collects system info and exfiltrates it without user consent. Redundant or suspicious imports. Malformed setup parameters (e.g., 'install_requires' value). The code executes a network request with system info, which is unusual for a typical setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing modules and reading a README file. It defines a function that runs only on Darwin (macOS), which collects system information via 'os.popen' commands, encodes the data in base64, and then constructs a URL to send this data to a remote server. This function is invoked during module import, meaning it executes automatically when the package is imported or installed. The 'setup' function defines package metadata but contains suspicious or malformed parameters, notably 'install_requires' with a non-standard value and an incorrect 'long_description_content_type' syntax. The key concern is the embedded code that exfiltrates system info to an external server, which indicates malicious behavior and data leakage.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains embedded malicious code that exfiltrates system information to an external server during installation or import, indicating malicious intent. The setup configuration also appears malformed, suggesting obfuscation or malicious tampering. Overall, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior and security risks.",
