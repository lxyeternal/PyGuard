{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package with metadata and dependencies, but also includes potentially malicious code that collects system information and exfiltrates it to a remote server.",
  "sources": "File read operation on 'README.md', command outputs from 'uname -a', 'id', 'pwd', and 'ifconfig' executed via os.popen, and hardcoded URL with base64-encoded system info.",
  "sinks": "Execution of os.system with constructed URL containing system information, which potentially transmits data to an external server.",
  "flows": "System commands (sources) gather environment details → data is encoded and concatenated into URL → os.system executes curl command (sink) sending data over network.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual import of both setuptools and distutils, redundant import of setup, use of sys.platform-specific function, collection of detailed system info, encoding and sending data via curl command, and hardcoded IP address in URL.",
  "analysis": "The code reads a README file but then defines a platform-specific function that executes multiple system commands to collect OS, user, IP, and directory info. This info is base64-encoded and appended to a URL. The URL is used in a curl command executed via os.system, which transmits the data to an external IP. This behavior is hidden within setup configuration, which is common in malicious supply chain attacks to exfiltrate system info without user knowledge. The code’s main purpose seems to be data collection and exfiltration, indicating malicious intent. The package metadata appears normal, but the embedded code is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior that exfiltrates system information to an external server without user consent. The purpose appears to be data theft or reconnaissance, concealed within package setup code. High malicious potential due to hidden data exfiltration mechanisms.",
