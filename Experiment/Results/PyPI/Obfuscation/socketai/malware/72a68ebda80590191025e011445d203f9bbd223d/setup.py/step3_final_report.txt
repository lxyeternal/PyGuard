{
  "purpose": "The code's purpose appears to be to collect system information on macOS systems and exfiltrate it to an external server during package setup, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "System commands executed via os.popen ('uname -a', 'id', 'pwd', 'ifconfig') to gather system info.",
  "sinks": "The constructed URL containing encoded system info and the os.system call executing curl to send data to an external IP address.",
  "flows": "Sources (system commands) feed data into JSON serialization and base64 encoding, which is then appended to a URL; this URL is used in a curl command executed via os.system to transmit data externally.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, redundant imports, data exfiltration embedded within setup code, and execution of network commands during package setup; use of hardcoded IP address and base64 encoding of system info.",
  "analysis": "The code performs covert collection of system info via multiple system commands, encodes this info, and exfiltrates it to an external server during package setup, which is suspicious and malicious. The function runs only on macOS, and the exfiltration occurs automatically, indicating malicious intent. Variable names are obfuscated, and the setup parameters contain anomalies such as malformed entries, further hiding malicious activity. The behavior aligns with known supply chain attack techniques, aiming to steal system data without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, actively exfiltrating sensitive system information to an external server during package installation. The obfuscation, embedded exfiltration, and external communication confirm malicious intent, warranting a high malware score and security risk assessment.",
