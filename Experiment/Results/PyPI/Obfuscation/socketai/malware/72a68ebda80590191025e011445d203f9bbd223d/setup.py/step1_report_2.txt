{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package, but it also contains embedded malicious behavior that collects system information and exfiltrates it via an HTTP request.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file; executing system commands via os.popen; gathering system info such as 'uname', 'id', 'pwd', 'ifconfig'.",
  "sinks": "Constructed URL with base64-encoded system info appended to a remote server address, then invoked with os.system to send data via curl.",
  "flows": "System info collected through os.popen calls -> JSON serialization and base64 encoding -> URL construction -> HTTP request sent via os.system calling curl.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variable names; code that collects environment and system info; sending data to external IP address; duplicated 'setup' import; suspicious function 'PhgdQmAqdStkdDAfiyDVdrmLGpESQtgt'.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple modules, including 'setuptools', 'distutils', 'sys', 'os', 'base64', and 'json'. It reads the 'README.md' file but then defines a function (on Darwin platform) that collects system details by executing shell commands. These details are serialized into JSON, encoded with base64, and then sent via a crafted URL to a suspicious IP address using 'curl'. This behavior indicates data exfiltration. The presence of obfuscated variable names and the direct network communication strongly suggest malicious intent. The setup configuration appears standard, but embedded within it is malicious code designed to silently gather and transmit system information without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains embedded malicious behavior intended for data exfiltration, likely to compromise system privacy. While the setup script appears legitimate at first glance, the embedded function that gathers system info and sends it to an external server indicates malicious intent. This should be considered highly suspicious and dangerous.",
