  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, with embedded code that collects system information and sends it to a remote server.",
  "sources": "File read operation for 'README.md', environment info collection via os.popen calls, URL construction, and os.system execution.",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing a curl command to send data to a remote server.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md -> Collecting system info -> Base64 encoding JSON data -> Constructing URL -> Executing curl command to send data.",
  "anomalies": "Embedded function that collects system info and sends it remotely without user consent, use of sys.platform check for Darwin (macOS) only, dynamic command execution via os.system with constructed URL, and obfuscated or unclear variable names. The code has potential privacy leakage behavior and remote communication that is suspicious in the context of a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with importing modules and reading a README file. It then defines a function 'PhgdQmAqdStkdDAfiyDVdrmLGpESQtgt' which is only executed on macOS. This function collects system details such as uname, id, pwd, and ifconfig output using os.popen. It encodes this information in JSON, base64, and constructs a URL with this data appended. It then executes an os.system call with curl to send the data to a specific IP address and port. The setup call appears normal but is accompanied by malicious-looking code that stealthily transmits system info to an external server. The code contains obfuscated variable names and dynamic system calls, which are typical signs of malicious or covert behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script embeds malicious behavior by collecting sensitive system information and sending it to a remote server without consent, especially on macOS systems. While the setup configuration seems legitimate, the hidden system info exfiltration indicates malicious intent or at least suspicious activity. The overall security risk is high, and the malware score is also high due to the covert data transmission.",
