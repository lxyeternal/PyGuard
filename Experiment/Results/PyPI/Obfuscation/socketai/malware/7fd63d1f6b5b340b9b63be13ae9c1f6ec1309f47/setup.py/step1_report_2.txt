{
  "purpose": "The script appears to set up a Python package with specific metadata, and dynamically loads additional code for processing files and extracting version information.",
  "sources": "Code reads files from the filesystem via the function QzAQcWQxYRuGObOFxDdIWYGGtdlxZvVh, which reads file contents, and executes dynamically decoded code through exec.",
  "sinks": "The dynamic execution of base64-decoded code via exec could execute arbitrary code if the payload is malicious. The file reading functions are typical and do not directly pose risks.",
  "flows": "The code decodes and executes a base64-encoded string, then uses file reading functions to load file contents, potentially passing untrusted input to exec if the source code is malicious.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically decodes and executes base64-encoded code, which is suspicious. The variable names are obfuscated, and there is no clear documentation of the decoded payload's purpose.",
  "analysis": "The initial part imports modules and defines variables. It then performs a base64 decode of an encoded string and executes it dynamically, which could be malicious if the payload is harmful. The base64 string decodes to code that imports modules and appears to set up functions for reading files and extracting version info. The setup() call is standard for Python packaging. The obfuscated code and use of exec with decoded payload suggest potential malicious intent, especially if the payload is from an untrusted source. The file reading functions seem benign but depend on the content being read, which could be manipulated if used improperly. Overall, the most concerning element is the dynamic execution of external code, which is a common tactic for malware obfuscation or malicious updates.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes a suspicious base64-encoded payload that is decoded and executed at runtime, which could be malicious. While it performs standard package setup tasks, the obfuscated and dynamic execution component warrants caution. The package could be compromised or contain hidden malicious functionality.",
