  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion due to obfuscation and dynamic execution of decoded payload at import time. This pattern is characteristic of malicious or backdoor code. The scores of malware (around 0.8-0.9), obfuscation (around 0.8-0.9), and security risk (around 0.85-0.9) are justified. It should be treated as potentially malicious until further analysis of the decoded payload is performed."
