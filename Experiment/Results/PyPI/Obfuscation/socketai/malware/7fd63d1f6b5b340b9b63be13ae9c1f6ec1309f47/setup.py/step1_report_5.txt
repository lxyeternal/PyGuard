  "purpose": "The code appears to define a setup script for a Python package, with some obfuscated code and dynamic execution. It also includes functions to read files and extract version information from a file.",
  "sources": "Reading from the file system via 'QzAQcWQxYRuGObOFxDdIWYGGtdlxZvVh' and 'aKjELWJIhgiaTODsahPKFVaoUvHDfzxR', which internally call 'QzAQcWQxYRuGObOFxDdIWYGGtdlxZvVh' and 'KByXiuhAfZtDfqdtFYyqEKBlGtNuSzQn'. Additionally, the code executes dynamically decoded base64 content.",
  "sinks": "The base64-encoded content is decoded and executed at runtime via 'exec'. This can potentially execute arbitrary code, making it a significant security concern if the decoded content is malicious.",
  "flows": "The script imports modules, decodes a base64-encoded string, dynamically executes it, and reads files based on provided paths. The flow involves decoding and executing obfuscated code, then reading version information from files.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic 'exec' with base64-decoded code, obfuscated variable names, and conditional import logic. The code reads files from disk based on user-provided paths without validation. The embedded base64 string likely contains hidden or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The script starts with importing future features and standard modules. It defines a variable with a seemingly random string, then proceeds to decode and execute base64-encoded code, which could contain malicious payloads. Functions are provided to read files and extract version strings, which are invoked later in the setup process. The setup call includes package metadata. The obfuscated and dynamically executed code indicates a potential attempt to hide malicious activity or malicious code delivery. The script’s structure, with the use of 'exec' on decoded content, is suspicious and risky.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated and dynamically executed content that could be malicious. The presence of 'exec' on decoded base64 data is a significant security risk. The overall structure suggests an attempt to hide malicious behavior, potentially delivering payloads during installation or runtime. This package should be considered suspicious and unsafe without further analysis of the decoded content.",
