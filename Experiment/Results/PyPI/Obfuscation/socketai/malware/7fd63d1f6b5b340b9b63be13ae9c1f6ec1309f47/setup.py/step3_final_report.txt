{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package that includes an obfuscated base64-encoded payload which is decoded and executed at import time, potentially containing malicious code.",
  "sources": "The base64-encoded string decoded and executed via exec(), functions reading files from the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "The exec() call on decoded base64 payload, which can run arbitrary code; file reading functions that could be exploited if user-controlled input is involved.",
  "flows": "Decoding the base64 string, then executing the resulting code via exec(), which may import modules and perform malicious actions; file reading functions that could be misused if paths are controlled.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated __future__ import, obfuscated variable names, embedded base64 payload decoded and executed at import time without validation, presence of dynamic code execution, and no validation or sandboxing.",
  "analysis": "The script contains a base64-encoded string that is decoded and executed at import time using exec(), which is a common technique for hiding malicious payloads. The code also includes functions to read files and extract version info, but these are standard and less suspicious. The obfuscation and dynamic execution are red flags indicating potential malicious intent. The high reliance on decoding and executing external code without validation suggests a backdoor or malicious payload could be embedded. The scores assigned by the reports vary but generally recognize the suspicious nature. Given the evidence, the potential for malicious activity is high, especially since code runs during package import, which could lead to remote code execution or backdoor behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion due to obfuscation and dynamic execution of decoded payload at import time. This pattern is characteristic of malicious or backdoor code. The scores of malware (around 0.8-0.9), obfuscation (around 0.8-0.9), and security risk (around 0.85-0.9) are justified. It should be treated as potentially malicious until further analysis of the decoded payload is performed.",
