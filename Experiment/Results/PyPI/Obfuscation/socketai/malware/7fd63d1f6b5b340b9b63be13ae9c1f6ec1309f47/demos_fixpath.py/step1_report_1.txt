  "flows": "Reading __file__ -> Constructing path -> Inserting into sys.path",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable name; no clear malicious code detected; no external data, credentials, or network activity",
  "analysis": "The code defines a variable with a complex, seemingly obfuscated name. It constructs a normalized path to the parent directory of the current file, then inserts this path at the start of sys.path to influence module import order. No data is leaked, no network activity, no code injection, and no sensitive information is handled. The obfuscated variable name may suggest an attempt to hide intent, but functionally, this is a standard pattern for manipulating module search paths.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply modifies the module search path to include the parent directory, possibly for custom import resolution. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware, though the obfuscated variable name may indicate an attempt to conceal intent. Overall, it appears benign.",
