  "review": "Let's analyze this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Confirm if the reported issues are present in the code.**  \n   The reports indicate \"Empty response\" for all five reports, providing no raw response or detailed information. Without additional context, it's impossible to determine what these reports are referencing—whether it's a vulnerability, malicious activity, or other issue.  \n   **Conclusion:** The reports do not contain any actionable or detailed information. They do not specify any issues, errors, or anomalies in the provided code snippet.\n\n2. **Identify and record any errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic, reasoning, or summary.**  \n   The reports lack substance: no raw response, no error details, no explanation. They simply state \"Empty response\" five times. This suggests either a failure in the reporting process or missing data.  \n   **Conclusion:** The reports are incomplete or invalid; they do not provide enough information to assess any security concerns.\n\n3. **Review the scores given to each issue.**  \n   Since no specific scores are provided in the reports, there's nothing to evaluate or adjust.  \n   **Conclusion:** No scoring adjustments are necessary due to lack of data.\n\n4. **Justify any risk score higher than 0.5.**  \n   No risk scores are presented, and the reports contain no evidence of issues. Therefore, assigning high risk scores would be unjustified.  \n   **Conclusion:** No justification for high risk scores; the absence of data indicates no identified risk.\n\n5. **Pay close attention to the malware score.**  \n   The code snippet appears to be a typical Python module with imports and an `__all__` declaration. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious activity.  \n   **Conclusion:** Malware score should be low or zero; no malware detected.\n\n6. **Challenge any claims about potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions.**  \n   Since the reports are empty and do not specify any vulnerabilities, any assumptions would be unfounded.  \n   **Conclusion:** No assumptions should be made; the reports are invalid.\n\n7. **Ensure the scores are consistent with the report.**  \n   Given the lack of data, scores should reflect the absence of any detected issues.  \n   **Conclusion:** Maintain low or zero scores for malware, obfuscated code, and risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no issues identified)\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The code appears standard and benign.\n- The reports are incomplete; no actionable data is provided.\n- If these reports are part of an automated system, they likely failed to retrieve or parse relevant information.\n\n**Summary:**  \nBased on the provided code and the empty reports, there is no indication of malware, obfuscation, or security risk. All scores should remain at zero, reflecting the absence of any detected issues.",
