  "review": "Let's analyze this systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:\n   - The provided code appears to be a standard Python module with imports, `__all__` declaration, and versioning.\n   - No malicious or suspicious code snippets are visible.\n   - The code primarily imports classes and functions from other modules, which are not provided here.\n   - Based solely on this snippet, there is no evidence of embedded malware, obfuscation, or malicious logic.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Summary**:\n   - All reports indicate \"Empty response\" with no raw response data.\n   - This suggests that the reports are either incomplete or not properly capturing the actual response content.\n   - The uniformity of \"Empty response\" across all reports indicates a systemic issue in the reporting process rather than an actual security concern in the code.\n\n3. **Review of Report Scores and Justification**:\n   - Since the reports contain no substantive data, there is no basis for assigning high malware, obfuscated, or risk scores.\n   - The lack of raw response data prevents any meaningful assessment of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n   - If scores were assigned, they should be very low or zero, reflecting the absence of evidence.\n\n4. **Potential Misleading Claims or Assumptions**:\n   - Any claim that the code is malicious or vulnerable based solely on \"Empty response\" is unfounded.\n   - Without actual content or context, assumptions about malware or vulnerabilities are unjustified.\n\n5. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:\n   - If scores are high, they are inconsistent with the evidence (or lack thereof).\n   - If scores are low, they are consistent, given the absence of data.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations**:\n   - The code itself does not exhibit any suspicious patterns.\n   - The report data seems to be incomplete or improperly collected.\n\n**Summary & Recommendations**:\n- The reports do not provide any concrete evidence of issues.\n- The \"Empty response\" indicates either a failure in the reporting process or that the reports are placeholders.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities can be inferred from the provided code or reports.\n\n**Final Risk, Malware, and Obfuscated Scores**:\n- **Risk Score**: 0.0 (no evidence of risk)\n- **Malware Score**: 0.0 (no malware detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0.0 (no obfuscation present)\n\n**Overall Conclusion**:\n- The code appears benign.\n- The reports lack sufficient data to justify higher scores.\n- If further data becomes available, reassessment should be conducted.\n\n---\n\n**Note**: Always ensure that report collection tools are functioning correctly to avoid false positives or incomplete data.",
