{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a Python module defining imports, constants, and export declarations for a larger package, likely related to proxy connections.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto) and the version string assignment.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not perform network operations, file I/O, or data processing.",
  "flows": "The code imports various components and exposes them via __all__, with no data flow or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated-looking variable and class names, but this is common in some codebases and does not imply malicious intent. No suspicious logic or behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python module with import statements and an export list. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious code is evident. The obfuscated names are benign and typical in some projects. The provided reports only mention 'Empty response' without further details, indicating they are incomplete or non-informative. No vulnerabilities, malware, or malicious behavior are detected within this snippet. The code's structure and content are consistent with a benign, standard module.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no evidence of malicious activity or vulnerabilities. The reports lack substantive data; thus, no issues are identified. The obfuscated names do not imply malicious intent, and the overall security risk is minimal.",
