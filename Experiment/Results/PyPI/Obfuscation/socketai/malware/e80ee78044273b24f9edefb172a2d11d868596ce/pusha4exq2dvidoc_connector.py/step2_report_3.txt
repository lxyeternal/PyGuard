  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their assessments with the code and considering the scoring rationale.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly identifies that the code manages DNS resolution and proxy configuration, with obfuscated naming but no explicit malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately assigns low malware (0), moderate obfuscation (0.7), and low security risk (0.3).\n- **Score justification:** The absence of hardcoded secrets, data exfiltration, or malicious network activity supports these scores.\n- **Verdict:** The report's reasoning aligns with the code. No changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Recognizes the code's role in proxy and resolver classes, noting dynamic URL formation with embedded credentials, obfuscation, but no clear malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** High confidence (0.85), obfuscation (0.4), malware (0), security risk (0.2).\n- **Score justification:** The dynamic URL with credentials is common in proxy configurations but can be suspicious if misused. Still, no evidence of malicious activity is present.\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable scoring; no adjustments necessary.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to others, notes obfuscation and dynamic URL construction, with no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Slightly lower confidence (0.7), higher obfuscation (0.8), malware (0).\n- **Score justification:** Obfuscation is high, but without malicious indicators, the malware score remains zero.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate scores; no change.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Highlights obfuscation, dynamic URL formation, and proxy handling, with potential for misuse but no explicit malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Same as above, malware at 0.2 reflects cautious suspicion but no concrete evidence.\n- **Score justification:** The malware score of 0.2 might be slightly high given the lack of malicious activity, but considering obfuscation and potential misuse, it's justifiable.\n- **Verdict:** Slightly increase malware score to 0.3 for consistency with the obfuscation level and cautious approach.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Emphasizes legitimate proxy handling, no hardcoded secrets, and standard configuration.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Malware score 0, obfuscation 0.4, security risk 0.2.\n- **Verdict:** The low malware score aligns with the benign analysis; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Adjustments:**\n\n- The only notable adjustment is for **Report 4**, where increasing the malware score from **0.2 to 0.3** reflects the high obfuscation and potential for misuse, aligning with a cautious security stance.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Estimated Scores:**\n\n**Malware:**  \n- Based on the collective analysis, most reports indicate no concrete malicious activity. The highest concern is obfuscation and flexible proxy configuration, which could be misused but isn't inherently malicious.  \n- **Proposed malware score:** **0.2** (slightly increased from 0.1 to 0.2 to reflect obfuscation and potential misuse).\n\n**Obfuscated:**  \n- Consistently high across reports, with scores around 0.7–0.8, justified by the obfuscated class and variable names.  \n- **Proposed obfuscated score:** **0.75** (average of reports).\n\n**Risk Score:**  \n- Considering the potential for misuse due to obfuscation and dynamic URL handling, but no direct malicious activity, a moderate risk score is appropriate.  \n- **Proposed risk score:** **0.3**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Estimated Score |\n|------------------|-----------------------|\n| Malware          | **0.2**             |\n| Obfuscated       | **0.75**            |\n| Security Risk    | **0.3**             |\n\nThis balanced assessment reflects the code's complexity and obfuscation without conclusive evidence of malicious intent. Further review of the helper modules and overall context is recommended for a definitive security stance.",
