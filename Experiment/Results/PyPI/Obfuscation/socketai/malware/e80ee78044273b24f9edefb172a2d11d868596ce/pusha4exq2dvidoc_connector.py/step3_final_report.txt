{
  "purpose": "The code manages proxy configuration, DNS resolution, and network connection setup, primarily for flexible proxy handling with obfuscated class and variable names.",
  "sources": "Parameters for proxy host, port, credentials, and DNS resolver configurations; class constructors and property methods.",
  "sinks": "URL formatting with embedded credentials, network request initiation, proxy setup, and DNS resolution.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into URL formatting and proxy setup; URL and proxy info influence network requests and DNS resolution.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of class and variable names, dynamic URL construction with optional embedded credentials, complex proxy handling, but no hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom resolver and connector classes for network proxy management, with obfuscated identifiers and dynamic URL formation. No evidence of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful payloads. Obfuscation may be for concealment or legitimate reasons. The dynamic URL with credentials is typical in proxy configurations but warrants caution. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate, albeit obfuscated, network configuration utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is complex and heavily obfuscated but shows no signs of malware or malicious intent. The obfuscation raises suspicion but is not definitive. The scores are consistent with a benign or legitimate purpose, with moderate risk due to obfuscation and dynamic URL handling. Continued review in the broader context is recommended.",
