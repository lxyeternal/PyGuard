  "conclusion": "The code is complex and heavily obfuscated but shows no signs of malware or malicious intent. The obfuscation raises suspicion but is not definitive. The scores are consistent with a benign or legitimate purpose, with moderate risk due to obfuscation and dynamic URL handling. Continued review in the broader context is recommended."
