      "confidence": 0.95,
      "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and exhibits behaviors consistent with malware, backdoors, or sabotage. The use of obfuscation, external script execution, and network routines confirms malicious intent. The overall security risk is severe, and the malware score should be set to 1.0. The obfuscation level is high, with a score around 0.9. The security risk score is justified at 1.0 due to system compromise potential."

      "obfuscated": 0.8,
      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code is suspicious primarily due to heavy obfuscation, minimal validation, and flexible network setup that could be exploited for covert communication or malicious tunneling. While no explicit malicious activity is detected, the obfuscation and minimal validation pose security risks. It warrants further static and dynamic analysis before deployment, and caution should be exercised if used in production environments."

      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code is complex and heavily obfuscated but shows no signs of malware or malicious intent. The obfuscation raises suspicion but is not definitive. The scores are consistent with a benign or legitimate purpose, with moderate risk due to obfuscation and dynamic URL handling. Continued review in the broader context is recommended."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate SOCKS proxy client with significant obfuscation. While it does not contain overt malware or malicious payloads, the heavy obfuscation and network control capabilities suggest potential misuse. The scores should be set to reflect moderate suspicion primarily due to obfuscation, with low likelihood of malicious activity."
