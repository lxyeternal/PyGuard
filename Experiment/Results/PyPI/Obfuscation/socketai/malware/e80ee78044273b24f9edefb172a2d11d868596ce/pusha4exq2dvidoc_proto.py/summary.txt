  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate SOCKS proxy client with significant obfuscation. While it does not contain overt malware or malicious payloads, the heavy obfuscation and network control capabilities suggest potential misuse. The scores should be set to reflect moderate suspicion primarily due to obfuscation, with low likelihood of malicious activity."
