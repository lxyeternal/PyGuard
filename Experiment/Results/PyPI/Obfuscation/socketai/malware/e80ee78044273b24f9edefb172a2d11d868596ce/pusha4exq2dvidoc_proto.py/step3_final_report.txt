  "purpose": "Implementation of a SOCKS proxy client supporting SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols, including address resolution, authentication, and data transmission over network sockets.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as destination host/port, proxy host/port, user credentials, and environment variables for event loop selection.",
  "sinks": "Socket send/recv functions, address resolution functions, and data encoding/decoding operations that handle potentially untrusted network data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through address resolution, socket connection, authentication, and data transmission functions, including proxy negotiation and data relay.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation evidenced by strange variable and class names, minimal comments, and complex control flow; unusual error class names; dynamic socket handling; credential management; and use of obscure constants.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive SOCKS proxy client with support for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5, including credential authentication and address resolution. Obfuscation is prominent, but no direct malicious payloads or backdoors are present. The functions perform legitimate proxy operations such as connection establishment, data relay, and error handling. The obfuscation and complex flow could be used to conceal malicious intent, but the code's core functionality aligns with standard proxy client behavior. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious network activity are evident. The high obfuscation score reflects the naming and structural complexity, while the absence of malicious payloads keeps the malware score low.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate SOCKS proxy client with significant obfuscation. While it does not contain overt malware or malicious payloads, the heavy obfuscation and network control capabilities suggest potential misuse. The scores should be set to reflect moderate suspicion primarily due to obfuscation, with low likelihood of malicious activity.",
