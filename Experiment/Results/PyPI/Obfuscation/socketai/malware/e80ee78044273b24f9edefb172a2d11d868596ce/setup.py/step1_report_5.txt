{
  "purpose": "This code appears to prepare and execute a potentially malicious script by decoding base64-encoded payloads, writing them to files, and executing a script file. It likely aims to establish persistence, run hidden or obfuscated code, and perform unauthorized actions.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'USERPROFILE'; base64 encoded strings decoded and written to files; reading the '__version__' variable from the package; reading 'README.md' file.",
  "sinks": "Writing to files in temporary directories; executing a .vbs script with 'Popen'; decoding and executing encoded code that likely contains malicious payloads.",
  "flows": "Base64 encoded payloads decoded and written to files -> Files executed or loaded in the system -> System executes scripts or payloads possibly containing further malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding on obfuscated strings; writing scripts with encoded content; executing a script (.vbs) directly from code; environment variable usage to determine temp directory; complex, seemingly obfuscated code with decoding and dynamic script execution.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing modules and setting up the environment. It reads the version from a file, then decodes base64-encoded strings and writes the decoded content into files within temporary directories. The content written includes Python code, VBScript files, and possibly other scripts, which are heavily obfuscated through base64 encoding. It then changes the working directory to the temp folder and executes the VBScript file using Popen. The decoded payloads contain code that appears to create and manage network connections, perform file operations, and potentially execute further malicious scripts. The overall structure indicates an intent to hide malicious payloads, establish persistence, and run hidden system commands or scripts, characteristic of malware or supply chain sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The script is highly suspicious due to its use of obfuscation, base64 decoding, dynamic script creation, and execution in a temp directory. It appears designed to deliver and run malicious payloads covertly, potentially establishing persistence or exfiltrating data. The code is obfuscated, employs dynamic code execution, and interacts with system files and processes in a manner consistent with malware behavior.",
