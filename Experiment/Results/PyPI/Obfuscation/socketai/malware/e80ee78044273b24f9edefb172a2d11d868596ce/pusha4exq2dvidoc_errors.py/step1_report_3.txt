{
  "purpose": "Defines multiple custom exception classes, some inheriting from a base exception class and others from built-in exception classes.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and inheritance declarations; no input or data reading operations observed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points; no external data handling or untrusted data flows identified.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink flows; code solely establishes class hierarchies without data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "All class names are nonsensical, obfuscated, and do not follow standard naming conventions; no functional code or logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists exclusively of class declarations for custom exceptions with obfuscated, non-descriptive names. There are no methods, no data handling, or external interactions. This pattern suggests obfuscation or placeholder code, but it does not inherently contain malicious behavior. The absence of suspicious code, data leaks, or malicious actions indicates a benign purpose, possibly to obfuscate or to serve as a template.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of obfuscated exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security risks. There is no evidence of malware or security vulnerabilities based on this snippet. The obfuscated naming may be an attempt at hiding intent, but without further context, it is benign.",
