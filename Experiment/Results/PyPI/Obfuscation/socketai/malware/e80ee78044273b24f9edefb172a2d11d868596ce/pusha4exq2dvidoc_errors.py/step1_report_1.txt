{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes, likely for a larger application or library.",
  "sources": "No input sources or data reading mechanisms are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points are present; the code only defines classes.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths are present; classes are isolated definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Class names are obfuscated with random, nonsensical strings, suggesting obfuscation or concealment. No explicit malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code such as network activity, data exfiltration, or system manipulation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions with highly obfuscated names. These classes inherit from built-in exceptions and do not contain any methods or logic. There are no input sources, data handling, or malicious payloads. The obfuscated names could be an attempt to conceal intent, but no malicious code or malicious behaviors are evident from these class definitions alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of obfuscated exception class definitions with no immediate signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation could suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent, but on its own, this code is benign.",
