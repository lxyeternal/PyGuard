{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes, mostly subclasses of a base exception, with no additional logic or behavior.",
  "sources": "No external data input or data reading sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to leaks or malicious effects are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows, input, or output processes within the code.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of multiple obfuscated-looking class names that serve as custom exceptions; no meaningful variable names or comments. The code appears intentionally obscure, but no malicious activity is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code only defines several custom exception classes, some inheriting from built-in exceptions like Exception and OSError, with no methods or attributes. The class names are intentionally obfuscated, which could be an attempt to hide their purpose, but they do not perform any actions or contain malicious logic. No external data handling, network operations, or suspicious behaviors are present. The overall structure suggests obfuscation rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists solely of obfuscated exception class definitions without any operational logic or data handling. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this snippet. The obfuscation alone does not indicate malicious activity.",
