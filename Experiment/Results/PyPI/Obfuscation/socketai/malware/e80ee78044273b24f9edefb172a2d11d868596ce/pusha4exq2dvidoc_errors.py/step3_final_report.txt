{
  "purpose": "Defines multiple custom exception classes with obfuscated names, likely for use in a larger application or library.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from built-in exceptions; no input/output or data handling present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external interactions; code is purely class declarations.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths; only class inheritance without methods or logic.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated class names with no semantic meaning, possibly to conceal intent.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions with obfuscated names. There are no methods, data processing, network activity, or malicious payloads. The obfuscation is consistent and intentional, which could be a red flag if part of a larger malicious package, but on its own, it appears benign. The malware score is correctly set to 0 due to the absence of malicious behavior. The obfuscation score is high (~0.8), reflecting the nonsensical class names. The security risk score is very low (~0.2), as there are no operational or security-impacting elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of obfuscated exception class definitions with no active or malicious behavior. While obfuscation can be suspicious, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks in this snippet. The scores are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
