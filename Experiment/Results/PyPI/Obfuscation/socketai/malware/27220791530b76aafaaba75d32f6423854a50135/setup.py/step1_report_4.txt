{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be setting up a Python package while also downloading and executing a Windows executable, which may be intended for malicious purposes such as persistence or malware installation.",
  "sources": "urllib.request.urlretrieve for downloading an executable from an external URL; environment variable 'USERNAME' for constructing file paths; subprocess.call for executing the downloaded file.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.call executes the downloaded executable, potentially executing malicious code; the executable is saved to startup folder, enabling persistence.",
  "flows": "URL retrieval → saving to startup folder → execution of the downloaded executable, which could perform malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Downloading an executable from a MediaFire URL and executing it without validation; saving the file directly into Windows startup folder for persistence; no verification or checksum validation of the downloaded file; use of environment variable 'USERNAME' for dynamic paths; the code runs system commands with elevated permissions.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by downloading a file named 'supra.exe' from an external mediafire link, which is potentially malicious as it bypasses typical security controls. The file is saved into the Windows startup folder, indicating an attempt to establish persistence. It then executes this file without any checks, and the executable's purpose is unknown but highly suspicious given its location and method of deployment. The use of environment variables makes the path dynamic, but this does not mitigate malicious intent. The setup function from setuptools is used, but it appears incidental and unrelated to the malicious activities. Overall, the script shows signs of malware delivery and persistence mechanisms, with no apparent benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains clear signs of malicious intent, including downloading and executing an external executable and establishing persistence in the Windows startup folder. The setup function is incidental and not related to the malicious activities. The overall security risk is high, and the code should be considered dangerous.",
