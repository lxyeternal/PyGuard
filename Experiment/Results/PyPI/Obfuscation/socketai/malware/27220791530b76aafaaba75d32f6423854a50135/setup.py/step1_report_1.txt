  "purpose": "Setup script that installs dependencies and attempts to download and execute a file from an external URL, potentially for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "urllib.request.urlretrieve() for downloading external file, environment variable 'USERNAME' for user directory, subprocess.call() for executing downloaded file.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.call() executes the downloaded file, potentially running malicious code or malware.",
  "flows": "Download file from external URL -> Save to startup folder -> Execute the file using subprocess.",
  "anomalies": "Downloading and executing an executable from a Mediafire URL is suspicious. Using environment variables to construct paths. The filename 'supra.exe' and placement in startup folder indicate persistence mechanisms. The code retrieves and runs an external binary without any validation.",
  "analysis": "The script retrieves an executable from a Mediafire link, saves it to the Windows startup folder, and executes it silently. The use of environment variables makes the path dynamic, but the behavior strongly suggests persistence and stealth. The setup function is standard, but the side effects include downloading and executing potentially malicious software without user consent. No obfuscation is evident; however, the behavior is highly suspicious due to the external download and silent execution.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external executable without user consent, likely for persistence or malicious activity. The pattern aligns with common malware techniques, including persistence via startup folder and external command execution.",
