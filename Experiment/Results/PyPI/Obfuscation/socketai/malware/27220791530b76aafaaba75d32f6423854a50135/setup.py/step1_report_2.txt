  "anomalies": "Unusual combination of setup script with code that downloads and executes a file, which is atypical for legitimate setup scripts. Use of external URL to download an executable and placing it in the startup folder suggests potential persistence or malware activity.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with standard package setup code using setuptools, which is normal. However, it then proceeds to download an executable from a Mediafire link—this is suspicious as it bypasses typical package distribution methods. The executable is saved to the user's startup folder, which is a common persistence technique for malware. The script then executes this file, which could be malicious. The use of environment variables to determine the path adds to the stealth, and executing the downloaded file without validation poses high security risks. These behaviors are typical of malware trying to establish persistence and run malicious code on the host system.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external executable and placing it in a persistent location (startup folder). This pattern indicates malicious intent, likely aiming to establish persistence and execute potentially harmful code on the victim's machine. The presence of this code in a setup script is highly suspicious and dangerous.",
