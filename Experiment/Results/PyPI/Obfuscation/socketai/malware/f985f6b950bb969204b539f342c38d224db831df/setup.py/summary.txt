  "conclusion": "The script exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution triggered conditionally. The behavior is consistent with malicious payload deployment or backdoor setup. Scores of malware (0.85), obfuscation (0.9), and security risk (0.9) are justified given the evidence."
