  "purpose": "Placeholder function with a static print statement, serving as a stub for main application code.",
  "sources": "No data sources; the function does not read input or external data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the function does not process or output untrusted data or perform external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the function only executes a print statement with no data propagation.",
  "anomalies": "The function name is obfuscated or nonsensical, which could be suspicious but is not inherently malicious; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static placeholder function with an obfuscated name. It contains no input handling, data flow, network activity, or malicious code. The high obfuscation score is justified by the nonsensical name, but the absence of malicious behavior or security issues is clear. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0 and low security risk scores. The obfuscation scores are moderate to high, reflecting the naming, but do not indicate malicious intent. Confidence in the benign assessment is high, given the simplicity and lack of suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign placeholder with obfuscated naming, showing no signs of malware or malicious behavior. The scores assigned across reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "obfuscated": 0.7,
