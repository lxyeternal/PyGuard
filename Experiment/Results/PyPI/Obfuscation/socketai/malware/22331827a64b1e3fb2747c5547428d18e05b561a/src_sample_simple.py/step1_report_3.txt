{
  "purpose": "The code collects local system information, encodes it, and sends it to an external server, potentially for tracking or malicious data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Requests to 'https://api.ipify.org' for public IP; os.uname() for hostname; __file__ for current script path.",
  "sinks": "Requests to 'https://kotko.me' with encoded system data appended as URL parameters.",
  "flows": "Source: 'https://api.ipify.org' and os.uname() and __file__; Data is encoded in base64; then sent via HTTP GET request to external server.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual use of obfuscated variable names; encoding and transmission of system info to a third-party server without any clear benign purpose; no user interaction or obvious functionality.",
  "analysis": "The script retrieves the external IP address, hostname, and script directory path, encodes this data in base64, and then transmits it via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious domain 'kotko.me'. The purpose appears to be collecting system details for unknown reasons. No validation or consent is present; the data flow suggests possible malicious intent for information gathering or exfiltration. The code's obfuscated style and lack of user-visible functionality raise suspicion of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is potentially malicious, as it secretly collects system info and transmits it to an external domain without user knowledge or consent, indicating malicious intent for data collection or exfiltration.",
