{
  "purpose": "The code appears to gather system information, encode it, and send it to an external server, potentially for tracking or malicious data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "requests.get('https://api.ipify.org'), os.uname(), __file__ (current script path), and user input via URL parameters.",
  "sinks": "requests.get() with constructed URL, especially sending encoded system info to 'https://kotko.me', which could be used for data exfiltration or tracking.",
  "flows": "System info (public IP, hostname, script path) is collected, formatted, encoded, and sent via an HTTP GET request to an external domain.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs multiple obfuscation-like steps: encoding and base64 encoding data before transmission. The purpose of encoding data, especially with no clear return or use, suggests an attempt to obscure data exfiltration. The domain 'kotko.me' is suspicious and not a standard service. No clear documentation or comments. No user input validation or handling.",
  "analysis": "The code fetches the public IP address from 'https://api.ipify.org', retrieves system hostname via os.uname(), and gets the script directory path. It formats and encodes these details, then sends them as a URL parameter to an external domain 'kotko.me'. The encoding steps (base64) obscure the data being transmitted. The data sent includes IP address, hostname, and script path, which are sensitive system details. The script executes automatically upon import or run, making it potentially part of a malicious tracking or data exfiltration effort. The use of obfuscation techniques indicates an intent to hide the data transmission.",
  "conclusion": "This script collects system information and transmits it to an external server, which could be used for malicious tracking or data exfiltration. The obfuscation and transmission to suspicious domains elevate the security concern.",
