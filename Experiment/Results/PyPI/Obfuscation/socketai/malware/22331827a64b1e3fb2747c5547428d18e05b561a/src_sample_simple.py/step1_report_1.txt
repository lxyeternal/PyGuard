{
  "purpose": "Collect system and network information, encode it, and send it to an external server via HTTP GET request.",
  "sources": "Reads system hostname (os.uname()), external IP address (requests.get('https://api.ipify.org')), and script file path (pathlib.Path(__file__).parent.absolute()).",
  "sinks": "Sends encoded data via requests.get() to 'https://kotko.me' with parameters that include system info, IP, and file path.",
  "flows": "Data is gathered from external IP, system hostname, and script path; then combined, base64 encoded, and transmitted to remote server through URL parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding on concatenated system data before transmission; the purpose appears to be obfuscation. No hardcoded credentials but the pattern of collecting environment info and exfiltrating it is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script collects the system's external IP, hostname, and script directory path. It encodes this combined data in base64, which might serve to obscure the transmitted information. The data is then sent via an HTTP GET request to an external domain 'kotko.me'. This behavior resembles data exfiltration or system fingerprinting. There are no signs of malicious payloads like executing arbitrary code, connecting to suspicious domains, or stealing credentials. However, the combination of data collection and encoding followed by external transmission without clear user consent raises security concerns, especially if used without user awareness.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs system information collection and exfiltration, which could be malicious depending on context. It does not contain explicit malware behaviors like code execution or system damage, but its behavior pattern is suspicious and warrants caution.",
