{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information including external IP address, hostname, and script directory path, then encodes this data and sends it as a parameter in an HTTP GET request to a remote server.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from external services (https://api.ipify.org), system environment (os.uname()), and the script's file path (via __file__).",
  "sinks": "The code sends the encoded data to a remote URL (https://kotko.me) as a GET request parameter.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external sources (IP address, hostname, path) into encoding steps, then is transmitted via an HTTP GET request to a remote server.",
  "anomalies": "The code encodes system and network information and transmits it remotely without any apparent user interaction or authorization. The URL used for data exfiltration appears suspicious and unprompted. Obfuscation is minimal but the intent to hide data transfer is evident. The code does not perform any useful function for a typical application.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers public IP, local hostname, and script directory path, encodes this information in base64, and then transmits it to a third-party server via a GET request. The data collection involves standard libraries, but the purpose seems to be data exfiltration. There are no user prompts, configuration inputs, or legitimate functional outputs. The remote server endpoint is obscure, and the gathered data could be used for tracking or malicious monitoring. No hardcoded credentials are present. The data transmission is passive and unsolicited, which is characteristic of malicious data exfiltration techniques.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be designed for clandestine collection and transmission of system information to an external server, which is suspicious and potentially malicious behavior. It does not perform any legitimate or benign function, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent.",
