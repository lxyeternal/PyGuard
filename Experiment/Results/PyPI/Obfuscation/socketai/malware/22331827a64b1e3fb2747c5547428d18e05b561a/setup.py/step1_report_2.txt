{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be a setup configuration for a Python package, with additional code that executes upon installation or script termination, possibly collecting and transmitting system and network information.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information (hostname via os.uname()), public IP address via requests to api.ipify.org, and the script directory path. It also reads the README.md file for the long description.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent via HTTP GET requests to 'https://kotko.me' with encoded system info and host details, which could be used for data exfiltration or tracking.",
  "flows": "System info (IP, hostname, path) is gathered and encoded in base64, then sent to an external server ('kotko.me') via a GET request when the script exits, indicating a source-to-sink flow for potentially sensitive info.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names (e.g., oQQRFETUBNjpbkTRTInhNlckXYTEZrDL, ddTJgQsqQKwIcoAqevhIgNuwGiFKHkFB), and code executing in the atexit handler that transmits data without clear user consent. The code fetches external data and sends it to an external domain, which is suspicious. The setup process also contains redundant or suspicious imports and code structure.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup script with a custom install class that registers a function to run at exit. This function collects the machine's public IP, hostname, and current script directory, encodes these details, and sends them to an external domain ('kotko.me') via an HTTP GET request. The data transmission occurs during the script's exit, which indicates potential malicious intent for data exfiltration or user tracking. Variable names are obfuscated, and the code uses dynamic data collection and encoding without clear justification, which raises suspicion. The overall pattern resembles malicious behavior aimed at stealthily capturing and transmitting system data.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious characteristics: it collects system information and transmits it to an external domain during script termination, with obfuscated variables and without user consent. This behavior suggests an attempt at covert data exfiltration, classifying it as malicious activity.",
