{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package with custom installation behavior, possibly including tracking or data exfiltration through network requests during exit.",
  "sources": "Requests to 'https://api.ipify.org' to obtain the system's public IP, and to 'https://kotko.me' with encoded data; access to filesystem paths; use of environment info (os.uname()).",
  "sinks": "Network requests sending system info to external domains; URL encoding and base64 encoding suggest data exfiltration; the request during program exit registers an exit handler that sends data.",
  "flows": "Upon script exit, the registered function collects external IP, hostname, and script path; encodes and sends this data via HTTP GET request to an external server ('kotko.me').",
  "anomalies": "The code obfuscates variable names, loads potentially unnecessary modules, and registers a network-sending function to run at exit, which is suspicious. Use of dynamic data encoding and external contact during cleanup phase is unusual for standard setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs package setup but also registers an exit handler that retrieves the system's public IP, hostname, and script path, then encodes this data and exfiltrates it via an HTTP request to an external server. The variable names are obfuscated, and the data collection occurs during the program's exit, indicating possible stealth data collection. No other malicious activities such as system modification, reverse shells, or code execution are evident. Use of standard setup tools and dependency management is normal, but the hidden data exfiltration behavior is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains hidden behavior where it collects system information and sends it to an external server during exit, indicating malicious intent to harvest system data covertly. The obfuscation and timing of data transmission suggest it may be malicious, possibly for tracking or surveillance purposes.",
