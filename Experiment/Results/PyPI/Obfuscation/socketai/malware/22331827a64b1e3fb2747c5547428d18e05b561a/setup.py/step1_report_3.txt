{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package installation process with additional network communication during cleanup, possibly to exfiltrate data or perform malicious actions.",
  "sources": "Requests to external URLs ('https://api.ipify.org' and 'https://kotko.me'), reading the local file path, and the package metadata fields.",
  "sinks": "HTTP GET requests with encoded data, sending potentially sensitive information (IP address, hostname, file path) to external domains.",
  "flows": "On package install or script termination, the code fetches external data (IP address), encodes it, and sends it to a remote server. It also reads local system info and file paths, possibly for data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "The code registers a cleanup function that triggers network requests with collected system information and encoded data. The function's purpose is obfuscated, using variable names with no clear meaning, base64 encoding, and string concatenation. It sends data to a suspicious domain ('kotko.me'), which is commonly associated with malicious activities. The code does not appear to perform any legitimate setup tasks related to the package.",
  "analysis": "The script imports several modules and defines a class for custom installation behavior. During the cleanup registration via atexit, it collects the public IP address, system hostname, and current file directory path. It encodes this data in base64 and sends it via a GET request to a suspicious domain. The setup function is configured with typical package metadata but includes these malicious-looking network activities embedded in the custom install class. The use of obfuscated variable names, external data exfiltration, and network communication during package installation are strong indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains malicious behavior designed to exfiltrate system information (public IP, hostname, path) to an external server. The obfuscation and network activity during installation suggest an intent to secretly gather and transmit user data, likely for malicious purposes. The package should be considered dangerous and not used.",
