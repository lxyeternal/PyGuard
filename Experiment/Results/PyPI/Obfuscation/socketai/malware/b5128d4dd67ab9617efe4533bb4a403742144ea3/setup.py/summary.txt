  "obfuscated": 0.3,

  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with superficial obfuscation and no malicious behavior. Dependencies are common and not inherently malicious, though they should be scrutinized in the broader supply chain. The assigned scores are appropriate; malware is absent, obfuscation is moderate, and overall security risk is very low."
