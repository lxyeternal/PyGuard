  "conclusion": "The code is highly obfuscated and employs dynamic code execution, strongly indicating malicious intent. The use of multiple decoding layers and eval() on decoded payloads confirms it is designed to conceal and execute potentially harmful code. The scores assigned in the reports are justified, and the overall security risk is extremely high. This dependency should be considered malicious and handled accordingly."
