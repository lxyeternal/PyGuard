      "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with superficial obfuscation and no malicious behavior. Dependencies are common and not inherently malicious, though they should be scrutinized in the broader supply chain. The assigned scores are appropriate; malware is absent, obfuscation is moderate, and overall security risk is very low."

      "confidence": 0.95,
      "conclusion": "The code is highly obfuscated and employs dynamic code execution, strongly indicating malicious intent. The use of multiple decoding layers and eval() on decoded payloads confirms it is designed to conceal and execute potentially harmful code. The scores assigned in the reports are justified, and the overall security risk is extremely high. This dependency should be considered malicious and handled accordingly."
