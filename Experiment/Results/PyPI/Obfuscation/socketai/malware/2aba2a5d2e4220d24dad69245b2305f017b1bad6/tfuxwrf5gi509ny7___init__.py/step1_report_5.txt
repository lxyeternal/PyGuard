  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some data processing or utility functions, but no explicit purpose is discernible from the provided code snippet.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from imported modules and possibly from environment variables or input functions, but no clear input or external data sources are shown in the snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or subprocess calls if present, but no such actions are visible in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Without explicit input/output or data flow commands, there are no identifiable source-to-sink data flows in the given snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or obfuscated code are evident. The code uses standard language features and common libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward with standard syntax and structure. No malicious or suspicious patterns such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious system modifications are apparent. There are no signs of obfuscation, suspicious data handling, or unintended behaviors. Due to the absence of external interactions, network activity, or secret data, the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indicators of malicious behavior, malicious intent, or security risks. The code is typical of normal Python functions and modules, with no suspicious elements identified.",
