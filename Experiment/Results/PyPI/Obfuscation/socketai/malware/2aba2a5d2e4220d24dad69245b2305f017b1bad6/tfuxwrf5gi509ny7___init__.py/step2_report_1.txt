  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- No code provided.\n- All fields confirm the absence of code, sources, sinks, or anomalies.\n- Scores: all zeros, which is appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** No issues. No code means no risk or malware. Scores are reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Also no code provided.\n- The report speculates about potential sources and sinks but admits no code is present.\n- Scores: all zeros, which aligns with the lack of code.\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies that no malicious activity can be inferred without code. Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- No code provided.\n- The report makes detailed observations about the structure, noting no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or anomalies.\n- Confidence is high (0.9), suggesting strong certainty in benign assessment.\n- Scores: all zeros, which is consistent with no code and no detected issues.\n- **Assessment:** Given the lack of code, the high confidence seems slightly optimistic but acceptable if the reviewer is confident in their structural analysis. No malware or obfuscation detected, so scores are reasonable.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- No code provided.\n- The report mentions potential data flows and sinks but admits no explicit code or suspicious patterns.\n- Confidence is moderate (0.6), which makes sense given the incomplete context.\n- Security risk is slightly above zero (0.2), possibly reflecting some concern over environment variables or potential external data sources.\n- **Assessment:** The cautious approach is justified; scores are reasonable given the speculative nature.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- No code provided.\n- The report notes standard code structure, no suspicious activity, and no obfuscation.\n- High confidence (0.9) and low security risk (0.1).\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate given the lack of code; the benign conclusion is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- All reports are based on the absence of code, leading to conservative scores (mostly zeros).\n- The reasoning is consistent; no code means no detectable malicious behavior.\n- The confidence levels in reports 3 and 4 are reasonable, considering the detailed analysis despite missing code.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- Since no code is provided in any report, the malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should remain at **0** across all reports.\n- The high confidence in report 3 might be slightly overstated but acceptable given the structural analysis.\n- No adjustments needed unless new code or context is provided.\n\n### Overall estimated scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 for all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 for all reports.\n- **Risk:** 0 for all reports.\n\n**Conclusion:** Without actual code, the safest stance is that there is no detectable malware, obfuscation, or security risk. The current assessments are appropriate.",
