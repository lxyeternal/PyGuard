  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and anomalies.",
  "sources": "No code provided; no input or data sources available.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows, sinks, or data leaks identified due to absence of code.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows present; analysis not possible without code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns detected; absence of code itself is noted.",
  "analysis": "All reports lack actual code, leading to the conclusion that no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks can be detected. High confidence scores in some reports are inconsistent with the absence of code but are justified if the code is genuinely missing. Scores for malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriately set to zero or near-zero, with minor adjustments to reflect the lack of code. The reasoning across reports is consistent, and no suspicious patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "Given the absence of code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assessments are appropriate, and scores are consistent with the available information. Minor confidence overestimation in some reports is acceptable if the code is truly missing.",
