  "purpose": "Minimal setup script importing setuptools and calling setup() with static parameters.",
  "sources": "Static code parameters: package name, version, license; no dynamic input or external data.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows, external connections, or data leaks.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow or external influence.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual, obfuscated-looking package name 'xde57tj16bd9mk0w', which may be intended to evade detection.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static setup script with no dynamic or malicious behavior. The package name appears obfuscated or randomly generated, which could be suspicious but does not indicate malicious intent by itself. No code injection, network activity, or credential handling is present. Malware score is appropriately zero; obfuscation score is moderate (~0.6) due to the suspicious name; security risk is low (~0.2) given the lack of active threats. The code's simplicity and static nature support a benign assessment, with the main concern being the obfuscated package name that warrants caution in a supply chain context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal setup script with an obfuscated package name. There is no evidence of malicious activity. The primary concern is the suspicious naming, which warrants further review if part of a larger supply chain analysis. Scores are malware=0, obfuscated=0.6, securityRisk=0.2.",
