  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, external modules/files, parameters.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file writes, system commands, execution functions (eval/exec), subprocess calls.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or input data to sinks like network, file, or execution points.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated code, dynamic execution (eval/exec), hardcoded secrets, suspicious control flow, lack of comments, unusual variable usage.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits patterns such as obfuscation and dynamic code execution in some reports, indicating potential risk. Benign reports lack suspicious patterns and are straightforward. Suspicious reports justify higher obfuscation and malware scores, while benign ones have low scores. Scores are consistent with the described code features. No confirmed malicious payloads or supply chain sabotage are identified. The overall suspicion level is moderate, primarily driven by obfuscation and dynamic eval/exec usage.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with some reports showing obfuscation and dynamic execution, which warrant caution but do not confirm malware. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No major adjustments are necessary; continued monitoring is recommended.",
