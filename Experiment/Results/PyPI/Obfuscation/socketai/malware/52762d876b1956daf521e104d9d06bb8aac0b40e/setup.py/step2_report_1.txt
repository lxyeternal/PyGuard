  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms the code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable name.\n- No malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious behavior.\n- Dependencies are common libraries that could be misused but are not inherently malicious.\n- Malware score: 0 (appropriate).\n- Obfuscation score: 0.4 (moderate, due to variable name).\n- Security risk: 0.2 (low).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizes the obfuscated variable name but finds no malicious behavior.\n- No active malicious code, just obfuscation.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Obfuscation: slightly lower at 0.3.\n- Security risk: 0.2.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same conclusion: benign setup script with obfuscated naming.\n- No malicious activity detected.\n- Malware: 0.\n- Obfuscation: 0.3.\n- Security risk: 0.2.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar findings: standard setup, obfuscated variable unused.\n- No malicious behavior.\n- Malware: 0.\n- Obfuscation: 0.2.\n- Security risk: 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Slightly more cautious due to package name and variable obfuscation.\n- Still no evidence of malicious activity.\n- Malware: 0.\n- Obfuscation: 0.4.\n- Security risk: 0.2.\n\n---\n\n### Synthesis and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious code or behavior. The dependencies are common and not inherently malicious. Therefore, **malware score should remain at 0**.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Variable names are obfuscated but unused; package names are nonsensical. Given the consistent obfuscation but lack of active malicious code, a moderate obfuscation score of around **0.3** seems appropriate.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Since there's no evidence of malicious activity, data exfiltration, or exploitation, the overall security risk remains **low (around 0.2)**.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The code appears benign, with obfuscation possibly intended to hide the package's purpose but not malicious.\n- No changes needed to the malware score.\n- Obfuscation score could be slightly increased to 0.3 to reflect obfuscated naming.\n- Risk score remains at 0.2.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.3\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the consistent pattern across all reports.",
