  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, installing dependencies.",
  "sources": "The 'setup' function call and the hardcoded version string.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; setup configuration defines dependencies but does not execute risky actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; dependencies are predefined and static.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a nonsensical variable name 'XggDWlWSNWqbNDvQEPfCoqHIjrzuRESJ' assigned a version string; package name 'ouyx4ux3smux87u7' appears obfuscated or non-descriptive. The dependencies listed ('browser_cookie3', 'discordwebhook', 'robloxpy', 'requests') are common but could be used maliciously if misused.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal setup script that defines package metadata and dependencies. The variable name 'XggDWlWSNWqbNDvQEPfCoqHIjrzuRESJ' is unusual and appears obfuscated, but it is not used elsewhere, indicating no malicious logic. The dependencies listed are common Python libraries that could be exploited if the package or dependencies are maliciously modified, but in this code, there is no active malicious behavior. The package name 'ouyx4ux3smux87u7' is also non-descriptive, possibly obfuscated, but that alone does not indicate malicious intent. No code execution, network activity, or data leakage is present in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be a benign package configuration with obfuscated naming, but no direct malicious or security-risk behaviors are evident within this code snippet.",
