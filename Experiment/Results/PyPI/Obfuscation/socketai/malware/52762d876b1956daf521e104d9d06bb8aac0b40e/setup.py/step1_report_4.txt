  "purpose": "Setuptools configuration for package installation, specifying dependencies.",
  "sources": "The 'setup' function call and the string 'XggDWlWSNWqbNDvQEPfCoqHIjrzuRESJ'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; no data leaks or malicious effects directly evident.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; setup configuration is static.",
  "anomalies": "The variable name 'XggDWlWSNWqbNDvQEPfCoqHIjrzuRESJ' is unusual and obfuscated, but it's unused; no malicious activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setup' and 'find_packages' from setuptools, defines an obfuscated variable assigned a version string, and calls 'setup' with a package name and a list of dependencies. The dependencies include 'browser_cookie3', 'discordwebhook', 'robloxpy', and 'requests'. These are common libraries for browser cookie access, webhooks, Roblox API interaction, and HTTP requests, respectively. The obfuscated variable is unused, indicating no dynamic code execution or malicious intent. The code appears to be a typical setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration script with an obfuscated but unused variable. There are no malicious behaviors, data leaks, or security risks present. Overall, it appears benign.",
