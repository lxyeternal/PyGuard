  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, specifying dependencies.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the 'install_requires' list and package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; however, dependencies may perform network requests or data access.",
  "flows": "Code imports setup functions, defines a version string, then calls setup with dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable name 'XggDWlWSNWqbNDvQEPfCoqHIjrzuRESJ'; no other suspicious code or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' for packaging, defines a version string with an obfuscated variable name, and calls 'setup' with package name and dependencies. No user input handling, no malicious code, and no suspicious behavior observed. The dependencies include 'browser_cookie3', 'discordwebhook', 'robloxpy', and 'requests', which are common libraries for web and Roblox automation but could be used maliciously if misused. However, based solely on this script, there is no direct evidence of malicious intent or malicious code injection.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable name, but no malicious code or suspicious behavior detected. Dependencies are common, and no hidden payloads or backdoors are evident.",
