  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package, defining dependencies and package metadata.",
  "sources": "The variable 'XggDWlWSNWqbNDvQEPfCoqHIjrzuRESJ' assigned a version string; the 'setup()' function call with package name and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or outputs; no dynamic code execution or network activity present.",
  "flows": "The variable assignment is unused; the setup() call uses static strings for name and dependencies without data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable name assigned but unused; package name is nonsensical or obfuscated; dependencies are common but could be misused if the package is malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal setup script with an obfuscated variable that is not utilized and a nonsensical package name. Dependencies are standard but could be exploited if the package is maliciously altered. No malicious code, data leaks, or network activity are present. The obfuscation appears superficial, mainly in naming, with no active malicious behavior detected. The variable is unused, indicating no hidden logic or backdoors. The package name and variable obfuscation could be red flags but are not evidence of malicious intent in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with superficial obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities within this snippet. The obfuscation and nonsensical package name warrant caution but do not constitute malicious activity. The malware score remains at 0, with low security risk. The obfuscation score is moderate (~0.3) due to naming, and overall risk is low (~0.2).",
