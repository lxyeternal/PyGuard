{
  "purpose": "This code is intended to set up a Python package with specified dependencies.",
  "sources": "The package name, version, and required dependencies are defined through the 'setup' function.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks, but the dependencies 'browser_cookie3', 'discordwebhook', 'robloxpy', and 'requests' could potentially be used maliciously if exploited after installation.",
  "flows": "The code defines package metadata and dependencies but does not include input/output flows or dynamic data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable name 'XggDWlWSNWqbNDvQEPfCoqHIjrzuRESJ' assigned a version string; the name appears obfuscated or intentionally obscure, which could be suspicious in some contexts. However, it does not execute any malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of a standard setuptools setup call, specifying package name, version, and dependencies. The variable used for versioning is obfuscated, which could be an attempt to hide details but is not inherently malicious. The dependencies listed are common in Python projects and include modules that could be exploited if misused, but their mere inclusion does not indicate malicious intent. No code execution, data leakage, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward setup script with an obfuscated variable name, which is unusual but not malicious. No malicious code or behaviors are evident. The package setup appears benign but should be reviewed in the context of its use and contents of dependencies.",
