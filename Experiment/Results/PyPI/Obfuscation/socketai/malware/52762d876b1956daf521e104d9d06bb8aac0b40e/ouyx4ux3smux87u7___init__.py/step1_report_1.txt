  "purpose": "Obfuscated code likely intended to execute hidden or malicious payloads through decoding, decoding base64 strings, and evaluating code dynamically.",
  "sources": [
    "eval() function at the beginning, executing code from decoded strings.",
    "Multiple base64-decoded strings that are subsequently decoded again and decoded with custom functions.",
    "Decoding and executing potentially malicious payloads stored in variables such as HewNrazXvLdXmjRFJfMTHrNqLcxhlMOH."
  ],
  "sinks": [
    "eval() which executes dynamically decoded code.",
    "executes decoded base64 strings which may contain arbitrary code execution.",
    "Decoding functions that process and execute hidden payloads.",
    "Use of decode(), b64decode(), and eval() that can be used to execute malicious scripts."
  ],
  "flows": [
    "Source: base64-encoded strings in variables, decoded multiple times.",
    "Decoded strings are passed to custom decoding functions.",
    "Decoded data is further decoded and then executed via eval or exec functions.",
    "Final payload is executed after multiple decoding steps, which could be malicious code."
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "Highly obfuscated code with multiple base64 encodings and custom decoding functions.",
    "Use of eval() and exec() on decoded payloads, typical in malicious scripts.",
    "Repeated decoding and decoding of strings before execution.",
    "No clear, readable logic or functionality, suggesting an intent to conceal malicious behavior."
  ],
  "analysis": "The code employs multiple layers of obfuscation, decoding base64-encoded strings repeatedly and then executing the result with eval() or similar functions. The presence of dynamically decoded payloads and execution functions strongly indicates malicious intent, as this pattern is common in malware that aims to conceal its payloads and evade detection. The code does not perform any meaningful or legitimate operations but instead appears designed to decode and execute hidden code, which is highly suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious and likely malicious. It decodes multiple layers of encoded payloads and executes them dynamically, which is a common technique in malware for executing concealed malicious scripts. The obfuscation, combined with dynamic execution functions, indicates a high probability of malicious behavior.",
