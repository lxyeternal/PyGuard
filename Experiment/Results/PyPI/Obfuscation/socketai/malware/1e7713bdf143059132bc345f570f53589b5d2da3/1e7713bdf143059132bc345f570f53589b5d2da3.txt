      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity, executing an obfuscated PowerShell payload silently during setup. The behavior is characteristic of supply chain malware or backdoor mechanisms. The high malware, obfuscation, and risk scores are justified. It should be treated as potentially malicious, warranting further analysis of the payload and caution in deployment."
