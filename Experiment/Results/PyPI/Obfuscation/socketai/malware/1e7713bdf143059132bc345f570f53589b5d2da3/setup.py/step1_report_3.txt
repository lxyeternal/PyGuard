  "flows": "Existence check of 'tahg' -> Execution of encoded PowerShell command via subprocess",
  "anomalies": "Encoded PowerShell command, use of subprocess with creationflags to hide window, exception handling that suppresses errors",
  "analysis": "The script begins with a standard setup call for a Python package. It then attempts to check for the existence of a directory 'tahg'. If not present, it executes a PowerShell command encoded in base64 via subprocess.Popen with hidden window flags. The command is encoded and appears suspicious, as it is obfuscated and designed to run silently. The use of try-except blocks suppresses errors, potentially hiding failures or malicious activity. The setup configuration appears normal, but the key concern is the encoded PowerShell command which could perform malicious actions, such as downloading or executing remote scripts, or other malicious payloads. No other suspicious code or hardcoded credentials are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated PowerShell execution triggered during setup, which is suspicious and likely malicious. The rest of the setup code is standard. The encoded command could be used for malicious purposes, such as downloading or executing additional malicious code silently.",
