  "purpose": "Decode and execute heavily obfuscated code, likely malicious.",
  "sources": "Reversed string input, base64 decoding, zlib decompression.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing decompressed code.",
  "flows": "Reverse string -> base64 decode -> decompress -> execute.",
  "anomalies": "Layered obfuscation including string reversal, base64 encoding, zlib compression, and immediate execution without validation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs multiple layers of obfuscation and then executes the decompressed payload via exec(). The pattern is characteristic of malicious scripts designed to hide payloads and execute arbitrary code. All reports correctly identify this pattern, with high scores for malware (0.9), obfuscation (0.9), and security risk (1.0). The obfuscation score in report 5 should be adjusted from 0.8 to 0.9 for consistency, given the heavy obfuscation. The overall analysis confirms a high likelihood of malicious intent, with the code pattern being a classic indicator of malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and likely malicious, employing layered obfuscation and dynamic execution. The scores are justified, and the pattern warrants treating this as a serious security threat.",
