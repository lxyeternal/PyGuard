{
  "purpose": "The code decompresses and executes a base64-encoded, reversed, zlib-compressed payload.",
  "sources": "The code reads its input from the string literal embedded in the lambda function and the encoded payload within the exec statement.",
  "sinks": "The payload, once decoded and decompressed, is executed via exec, which could run arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "The code takes the payload string, reverses it, decodes it from base64, decompresses it with zlib, then executes it, forming a source-to-sink flow into execution.",
  "anomalies": "The payload is heavily obfuscated: reversed, base64-encoded, and zlib-compressed. No explicit secrets or credentials are visible. The code uses dynamic import and exec, which are suspicious practices often associated with malicious code. The payload appears to be deliberately obfuscated to hide its true intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a lambda function that imports 'zlib' and 'base64' dynamically, then decompresses and decodes its input string. The payload is a large, heavily obfuscated string that is reversed, base64-decoded, and zlib-decompressed, then executed. This pattern is typical of malware obfuscation techniques, aiming to conceal malicious behavior. The use of exec on decoded data indicates high risk, as it could execute arbitrary, potentially harmful code. No other third-party library usage or external network activity is directly visible. The obfuscation and dynamic execution strongly suggest malicious intent or, at minimum, malicious capability.\n",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits typical malware obfuscation and dynamic execution techniques, strongly indicating malicious intent. It is designed to hide its payload and run arbitrary code upon execution. Due to the heavy obfuscation, exact behavior cannot be determined without decompressing and analyzing the payload, but the pattern itself is suspicious and high risk.",
