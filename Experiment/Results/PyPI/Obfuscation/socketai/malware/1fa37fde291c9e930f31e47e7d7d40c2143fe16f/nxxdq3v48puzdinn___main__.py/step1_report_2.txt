{
  "purpose": "Decodes and executes compressed and reversed base64-encoded code, likely to run obfuscated malicious payload.",
  "sources": "Input data is the byte string passed to the lambda function, which is a hardcoded, reversed, base64-encoded string within the code.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the decompressed code via exec(), which could lead to arbitrary code execution.",
  "flows": "Base64 decoding, string reversal, zlib decompression, then execution of the resulting code.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses obfuscation techniques: reversing the string, base64 decoding, and zlib decompression. The payload is entirely embedded as a hardcoded string, which is typical of malicious obfuscation. The code uses lambda for self-contained decoding and execution, with no apparent input or external data sources.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a lambda function that takes an input, reverses it, base64 decodes it, then decompresses it with zlib. It immediately executes the decompressed code via exec(). The payload is a large, heavily obfuscated string, indicating an attempt to hide malicious intent. No other library calls or network activity are present; the main suspicious element is the obfuscated execution of a decompressed payload, which could perform any malicious action such as system compromise, data exfiltration, or backdoor installation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious due to its obfuscation and dynamic code execution. It likely contains malicious payload designed to run arbitrary code after decompression and decoding. The intent appears to be to conceal malicious behavior, which warrants a high security risk score.",
