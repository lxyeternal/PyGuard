  "purpose": "Assess open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and anomalous patterns based on provided code snippets or descriptions.",
  "sources": "Input data, environment variables, network communication functions, file operations, data processing routines.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission points, file write/read operations, environment variable access, system commands execution.",
  "flows": "Input sources to sinks via data processing functions, network calls, or environment variable reads.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, suspicious network domains, obfuscated code, unusual data flows, or hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "All reports lack actual code, limiting analysis. The reports correctly identify the absence of code and assign low or zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and risk. Report 3 describes benign data processing with high confidence, justifying zero malware and low risk scores. Other reports acknowledge the lack of code and refrain from unwarranted claims. The reasoning is consistent, cautious, and appropriate given the evidence. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious activity are indicated. The scores align with the descriptions and evidence, with minimal risk scores justified due to missing code but acknowledging potential concealment if code were present.",
  "conclusion": "All reports are reasonable and consistent with the evidence, primarily the absence of code. No malicious activity or obfuscation is detected. The low risk scores are appropriate, though slightly increasing risk estimates could be considered if future code reveals hidden issues. Overall, the security posture appears benign based on current information.",
