  "conclusion": "All reports are reasonable and consistent with the evidence, primarily the absence of code. No malicious activity or obfuscation is detected. The low risk scores are appropriate, though slightly increasing risk estimates could be considered if future code reveals hidden issues. Overall, the security posture appears benign based on current information."
