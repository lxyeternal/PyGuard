      "conclusion": "All reports are reasonable and consistent with the evidence, primarily the absence of code. No malicious activity or obfuscation is detected. The low risk scores are appropriate, though slightly increasing risk estimates could be considered if future code reveals hidden issues. Overall, the security posture appears benign based on current information."

      "conclusion": "The code is malicious, explicitly designed to exfiltrate Roblox cookies by reading sensitive data from the registry and sending it to an external webhook. It exhibits typical traits of credential-stealing malware with no obfuscation or legitimate purpose. The high malware and security risk scores are justified given its activity, and the code should be flagged as malicious."
