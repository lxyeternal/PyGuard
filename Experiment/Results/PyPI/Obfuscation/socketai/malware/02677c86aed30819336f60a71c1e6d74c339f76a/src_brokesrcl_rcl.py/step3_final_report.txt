{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to access the Windows registry to retrieve the Roblox cookie stored under a specific registry key, parse it, and exfiltrate it via a Discord webhook, indicating malicious intent to steal user credentials.",
  "sources": "Registry key at HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Roblox\\RobloxStudioBrowser\\roblox.com, specifically the value '.ROBLOSECURITY'; the code reads this value during execution.",
  "sinks": "The POST request to the hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which transmits the extracted Roblox cookie to an external server, acting as the sink for exfiltrated data.",
  "flows": "The code reads the registry value '.ROBLOSECURITY' as the source, parses the cookie value, and then sends it via an HTTP POST request to the webhook URL, constituting the data flow from source to sink.",
  "anomalies": "Use of try-except blocks to suppress errors, hardcoded webhook URL, straightforward registry access for sensitive data, and lack of legitimate functionality; no obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The script accesses the Windows registry to locate the Roblox security cookie, parses the cookie value, and exfiltrates it to an external webhook, indicating malicious intent. The code is simple, not obfuscated, and employs error suppression to hide failures. The activity is clearly malicious, aiming to steal user credentials without consent. The hardcoded webhook and registry access are typical of credential-stealing malware. The code's purpose and flow are direct, with no signs of obfuscation or benign functionality. The use of try-except blocks to hide errors further supports malicious intent. Overall, the code is a straightforward credential stealer targeting Roblox users.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, explicitly designed to exfiltrate Roblox cookies by reading sensitive data from the registry and sending it to an external webhook. It exhibits typical traits of credential-stealing malware with no obfuscation or legitimate purpose. The high malware and security risk scores are justified given its activity, and the code should be flagged as malicious.",
