{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract the Roblox security cookie from the Windows Registry and send it to a specified Discord webhook, effectively capturing and exfiltrating user credentials.",
  "sources": "Reading from Windows Registry at 'SOFTWARE\\Roblox\\RobloxStudioBrowser\\roblox.com' to find the '.ROBLOSECURITY' value.",
  "sinks": "Sending data via requests.post() to an external Discord webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Registry value read (source) -> cookie value extracted -> webhook URL (sink) with the cookie sent.",
  "anomalies": "Use of Windows Registry manipulation to extract sensitive credentials; unencrypted exfiltration of cookies; code attempts to parse specific registry values; no user consent or security measures; no input validation, which is typical but in this context malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and defines a function GrabCookie() that accesses the Windows Registry to locate Roblox cookies. It enumerates registry values within a specific key and retrieves the '.ROBLOSECURITY' cookie. The cookie is then parsed from the registry value and sent via an HTTP POST request to a Discord webhook. The code does not perform any validation, user interaction, or authorization, indicating malicious intent focused on credential theft. The use of try-except blocks suppresses errors, potentially hiding failures that could alert the user. The code is concise but explicitly designed to exfiltrate sensitive data, which is a clear malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, functioning as a Roblox cookie stealer. It reads sensitive user credentials from the registry and sends them to an external server without consent. This aligns with typical credential harvesting malware. The overall security risk is high, and the malware score is also high due to its intent and actions.",
