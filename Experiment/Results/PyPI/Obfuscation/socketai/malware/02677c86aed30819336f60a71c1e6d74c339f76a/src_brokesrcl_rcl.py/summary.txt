  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, explicitly designed to exfiltrate Roblox cookies by reading sensitive data from the registry and sending it to an external webhook. It exhibits typical traits of credential-stealing malware with no obfuscation or legitimate purpose. The high malware and security risk scores are justified given its activity, and the code should be flagged as malicious."
