  "purpose": "The code is designed to retrieve the Roblox security cookie from the Windows registry and send it to a specified Discord webhook, effectively performing credential theft.",
  "sources": "Reads the Windows registry key at HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Roblox\\RobloxStudioBrowser\\roblox.com to extract the '.ROBLOSECURITY' value, and also calls the GrabCookie() function recursively.",
  "sinks": "Sends the stolen cookie via an HTTP POST request to a Discord webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Reads registry data (source) -> extracts cookie value -> posts cookie to webhook (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Unconditionally attempts to access Windows registry to steal cookies, uses recursive call to GrabCookie() which is redundant, and embeds the webhook URL directly in code. The code lacks any user prompts or legitimate functionality; it's solely focused on credential theft.",
  "analysis": "The script imports modules to access Windows registry and perform HTTP requests. It targets a specific registry path associated with Roblox Studio to locate the '.ROBLOSECURITY' cookie. It loops through registry values to find this cookie. Once retrieved, it sends the cookie to a Discord webhook, which is a malicious action intended to exfiltrate user credentials. The use of try-except blocks suppresses errors, ensuring the script runs silently. The code is minimal but malicious, with no legitimate functionality or user interaction. The embedded webhook URL indicates the code's intent to exfiltrate sensitive user data.\n\nThe code structure, variable names, and purpose clearly suggest malicious intent, specifically credential theft via registry access and webhook exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a credential stealer targeting Roblox cookies, sending stolen data to an external server via a webhook. Its purpose and behavior are malicious, with no legitimate use. It demonstrates clear malicious intent with no obfuscation, but direct embedding of the webhook URL and registry access are suspicious.",
