{
  "purpose": "The script aims to retrieve Roblox Studio cookies from the Windows Registry and send them to a specified Discord webhook, likely for malicious purposes such as account hijacking.",
  "sources": "Registry key 'HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Roblox\\RobloxStudioBrowser\\roblox.com', and the function call GrabCookie() itself which reads the registry.",
  "sinks": "Requests POST to a Discord webhook URL with the extracted cookie, potentially leaking sensitive data externally.",
  "flows": "Reads registry data (source), extracts cookie value, then posts this untrusted data to an external webhook (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded webhook URL; attempt to read specific registry keys related to Roblox security tokens; uses exception handling to suppress errors; suspicious intent to exfiltrate user cookies.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, then accesses Windows registry to locate Roblox cookies. It loops through registry entries, looking for '.ROBLOSECURITY'. Upon finding it, it attempts to parse and extract the cookie value. The cookie is then sent via an HTTP POST request to a Discord webhook, which is hardcoded in the script. The code includes exception handling to prevent crashes if registry keys are missing. The purpose appears to be theft of Roblox security cookies, which can be used for unauthorized access. The overall structure is straightforward but malicious in intent, with no legitimate purpose. The code's main operation is reading sensitive user data and exfiltrating it, fitting typical malware behavior for credential theft.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, designed to steal Roblox user cookies by reading the registry and exfiltrate them via a webhook. It exhibits malicious intent with clear data exfiltration behavior. The code is not obfuscated, but its purpose is clearly harmful.",
