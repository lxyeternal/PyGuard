{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to extract the .ROBLOSECURITY cookie from the Windows Registry related to Roblox Studio and send it to a Discord webhook, likely for malicious purposes such as stealing user credentials.",
  "sources": "Reads the registry key at HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Roblox\\RobloxStudioBrowser\\roblox.com and attempts to extract the cookie value.",
  "sinks": "Sends the extracted cookie to an external Discord webhook via requests.post.",
  "flows": "Reads registry data (source) → Parses and extracts cookie → Sends cookie data over network (sink) to webhook.",
  "anomalies": "The code is intentionally designed to steal cookies without user consent, uses try-except blocks to suppress errors, and contains hardcoded webhook URL. The function GrabCookie is called within an exception handler, which may hide errors. The overall purpose appears malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports requests and Windows registry modules. It attempts to access a specific registry key associated with Roblox Studio. If found, it enumerates values to locate the '.ROBLOSECURITY' key. Upon success, it extracts the cookie value, parses it, and sends it via a POST request to a specified Discord webhook. The try-except blocks suppress errors, potentially hiding failures. The hardcoded webhook URL indicates an intent to exfiltrate user data maliciously. The code lacks any legitimate user-facing functionality and is structured solely to steal cookies.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, designed to steal Roblox cookies by reading registry data and exfiltrating them via a webhook. It exhibits clear signs of malicious intent with no legitimate purpose. The code is structured to operate covertly, and its purpose aligns with typical credential-stealing malware.",
