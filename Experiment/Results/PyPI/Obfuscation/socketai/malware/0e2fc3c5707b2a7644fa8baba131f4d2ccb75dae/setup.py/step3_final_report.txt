{
  "purpose": "Detects and executes a decrypted payload during installation on Windows, using obfuscation and hardcoded cryptographic keys, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Encrypted payload string, cryptographic key, os.name check, import statements for requests and Fernet.",
  "sinks": "exec() call on decrypted code, potentially executing malicious code or backdoors.",
  "flows": "On Windows, imports requests and Fernet, decrypts payload with hardcoded key, then executes decrypted code via exec().",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded cryptographic key, encrypted payload, obfuscated variable names, conditional execution only on Windows, dynamic execution of decrypted code.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally decrypts an encrypted payload with a hardcoded key during installation on Windows and executes it via exec(), which is a classic malicious pattern. Variable names are nonsensical, indicating obfuscation. The decrypted payload is not visible, suggesting concealment of malicious intent. The use of cryptographic functions and runtime code execution during setup pose high security risks. The high scores assigned in reports (0.75-1.0 malware, 0.8-0.9 obfuscated, 0.8-1.0 risk) are justified given these indicators. The code's behavior aligns with typical malicious backdoors or payload delivery mechanisms, warranting a high malware score of approximately 0.9, obfuscation score around 0.9, and security risk near 0.9.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code exhibits high malicious potential through runtime decryption and execution of obfuscated payloads during package installation, especially on Windows. The evidence supports assigning high malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores. The package should be flagged as malicious and avoided.",
