{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a setup configuration for a Python package with an installation routine that conditionally executes code on Windows systems, including decryption and execution of a payload.",
  "sources": "Reads include imported modules (setuptools, os, requests, fernet), environment variables (os.name), and embedded byte strings used for decryption.",
  "sinks": "exec() call executing decrypted code, potentially malicious payload, and conditional import of requests and Fernet for network or cryptographic operations.",
  "flows": "During installation on Windows, code decrypts a payload with Fernet and executes it via exec(), which may lead to arbitrary code execution if payload is malicious.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, hardcoded cryptographic key, encrypted payload embedded directly in code, use of exec() on decrypted data, conditional execution based on OS, setup configuration with no clear purpose.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools and OS modules, then defines a custom install class that overrides the install method. Inside this method, it checks if the OS is Windows ('nt'). If so, it imports requests and Fernet, then decrypts a hardcoded payload with a hardcoded key and executes the decrypted code. The setup() call configures package metadata, specifying the custom install class. The presence of a decrypted payload executed at install time, especially with obfuscated variables and hardcoded cryptographic material, indicates potential malicious intent. The decrypted code could perform unauthorized actions such as system modifications, data exfiltration, or remote command execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, malicious behavior characterized by decrypting and executing hidden payloads during installation on Windows systems. The use of hardcoded cryptographic keys and exec() suggests an attempt to conceal malicious activities, representing a high security risk. This package should be considered unsafe for use.",
