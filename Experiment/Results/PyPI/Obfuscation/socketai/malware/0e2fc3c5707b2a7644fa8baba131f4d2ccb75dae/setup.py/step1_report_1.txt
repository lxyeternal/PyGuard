  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that conditionally executes code during installation.",
  "sources": "Imports os, requests, Fernet; decrypts and executes code; reads environment info; setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executes decrypted code; potentially running arbitrary code from the decrypted payload.",
  "flows": "During installation, if on Windows, requests Fernet decrypts a string and executes it, then proceeds with setup.",
  "anomalies": "Encrypted string executed via exec(); use of decrypt and runtime code execution; no clear reason for decryption step; suspicious variable names and obfuscated code flow.",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally runs code on Windows platforms, decrypts a string with Fernet, and executes it dynamically, which is unusual and potentially malicious. The code seems designed to hide malicious payloads or backdoors. The rest of the setup process appears standard, but the dynamic code execution represents a significant security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, potentially malicious behavior involving runtime decryption and execution of code, which could be used for malicious purposes like backdoors or data exfiltration. This package should be considered high risk due to dynamic code execution and encryption, indicating malicious intent.",
