{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'g0g9ulqm1wtostav', defining metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data for package configuration (name, version, modules, dependencies, license, classifiers).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no network or file operations involving external input.",
  "flows": "The setup function uses predefined strings and lists to configure package metadata; no dynamic data flows or untrusted data paths.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names (e.g., RXVMELWvcXJrMkxqfsjSzcbknPYONRBC, nTlkDDCkaiXUoUvANlLAKUmnuytULjov, kzawArWCXlScBBKKPciHnuirPaMVPcPl), which are unusual for clear, maintainable setup scripts. No obvious malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup' with package metadata and dependencies. Variable names are intentionally obfuscated, but the code's structure aligns with standard setup scripts. The dependencies listed are common packages; no suspicious or malicious packages are included. No code execution, network activity, or data leakage observed. The obfuscation appears to be an attempt to hide the variable purpose, but it doesn't imply malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation is likely for code concealment rather than malicious purposes.",
