{
  "purpose": "This code is a standard Python setup script using setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads static package metadata, dependency lists, and obfuscated variable assignments; no external or untrusted data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or where malicious actions could be triggered; no network or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves defining package metadata and dependencies, with no dynamic or data flow from sources to sinks; obfuscation does not alter this static flow.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names (e.g., RXVMELWvcXJrMkxqfsjSzcbknPYONRBC) are unusual and may be intended to conceal intent, but no malicious code or behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with obfuscated variable names, which could be used to hide malicious intent but, in this static context, shows no evidence of malicious activity. Dependencies are common packages, and there are no network calls or dynamic code execution. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. Malware scores are low (0), and security risks are minimal (around 0.2), with high confidence that the code is benign. The obfuscation is notable but not sufficient to classify the package as malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not justify a high malware or security risk score. Overall, the package appears safe based on static analysis.",
