  "anomalies": [
    "presence of a large, seemingly random, and non-ASCII byte string passed to '__pyarmor__'",
    "use of an obfuscated byte array, which is typical in packed or protected malware to hide payloads",
    "initial function calls to runtime libraries that are not used explicitly elsewhere"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code starts by importing 'pyarmor_runtime' and then calls it, which sets up the environment for protected code execution. The critical part is the call to '__pyarmor__' with a large obfuscated byte string, which is likely a payload encrypted or packed to evade static analysis. The byte string is passed with an argument indicating version or type, and the subsequent process probably decrypts and executes embedded malicious code at runtime. The usage of such protection functions is common in malicious packages aiming to hide their true intent. The code does not contain other suspicious or malicious functions directly but relies on the obfuscated payload executed at runtime, which is a high indicator of malicious behavior. Overall, this is a typical pattern for malicious or highly protected code designed to run concealed payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious due to its use of runtime decryption of an embedded bytecode payload, likely intended to execute malicious activities covertly. The obfuscated byte string passed to '__pyarmor__' strongly suggests malware or malicious behavior hidden behind code protection techniques. The initial setup and the encrypted payload are typical in malicious supply chain attacks or obfuscated malware packages.",
