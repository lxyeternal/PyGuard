{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information such as hostname, current directory, username, network interface IP addresses, and directory listings, then encodes and exfiltrates this data to a suspicious external server during package installation.",
  "sources": "System calls for hostname, current working directory, username; netifaces interfaces for IP addresses; directory listing functions; environment variables.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST request to 'https://425a2.rt11.ml' with encoded system info and directory data.",
  "flows": "Data is gathered from system calls and network interfaces, encoded (hex, replace), assembled into JSON payload, then transmitted via requests.post to external URL.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names; hex encoding of data; dynamic construction of identifiers and hostnames; data exfiltration during setup; use of suspicious external domain; extensive data collection without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code employs obfuscation techniques (hex encoding, variable name mangling) to conceal its purpose. It gathers hostname, current directory, username, network interface IPs, and directory listings, encodes this information, and sends it to an external server during installation. The external URL is suspicious and unrelated to the package's purpose. The network activity and data collection are typical indicators of malicious behavior. No payload execution or destructive commands are present, but the covert exfiltration of system data signifies malicious intent. The obfuscation and external communication strongly suggest malicious activity, possibly for reconnaissance or privacy invasion. The code's behavior during setup is a significant security concern, justifying high malware, obfuscation, and risk scores.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code exhibits covert data exfiltration during package installation, employing obfuscation techniques and communicating with a suspicious external domain. These behaviors are indicative of malicious activity aimed at privacy invasion or reconnaissance. The scores assigned in the reports are justified and consistent with the observed behavior, warranting caution and further investigation.",
