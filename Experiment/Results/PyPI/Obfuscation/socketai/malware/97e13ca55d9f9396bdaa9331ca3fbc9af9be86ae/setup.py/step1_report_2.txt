{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform custom installation behavior, gathering system information, network interface details, and hostname, then sending this data to an external server during setup.",
  "sources": "Reads system hostname, current working directory, user name, network interfaces and IP addresses, and environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Sends collected data via an HTTP POST request to an external URL (https://425a2.rt11.ml).",
  "flows": "System info and network data are gathered (sources), then packaged into a JSON payload, and transmitted to an external server (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names; the code collects extensive system and network info and exfiltrates it to an external server without clear legitimate purpose; use of hex encoding on hostname, user, and paths; dynamic address generation from local interfaces. The URL used for data exfiltration looks suspicious and unrelated to the package name.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to collect local network interfaces and IP addresses, including IPv4 and IPv6. It includes a custom installation class that, during setup, gathers hostname, current directory, username, network info, and encodes this data in a complex manner, then sends it via a POST request to an external server. The obfuscated naming and the unprovoked exfiltration of system data indicate malicious intent or covert surveillance activity. The presence of hex encoding and dynamic IP address processing further suggest attempts to evade detection or obfuscate data. The external server address is suspicious and unrelated to the package name, hinting at potential malicious data collection or command-and-control communication.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting detailed system and network information and transmitting it to an external server during package installation. Obfuscated naming, extensive data exfiltration, and the suspicious external URL strongly suggest malicious intent, possibly for surveillance or data theft.",
