  "purpose": "Define and configure the setup for a Python package named 'gikqe7fxaliosz76'.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables for file path operations, and package metadata (name, version, description, requirements).",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data output or external connections.",
  "flows": "Environment variables used for path resolution; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names and inconsistent code style; potential code obfuscation attempt, but no malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and 'os', constructs an absolute path using environment variables, and calls 'setup' with package metadata and dependencies. No network calls, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are evident. The variable names appear intentionally obfuscated, which could be an attempt to hide malicious intent, but code content does not support this. The setup configuration appears typical for Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with obfuscated variable names but no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. No malware or security risks identified.",
