  "flows": "No untrusted data flows from sources to sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are heavily obfuscated and nonsensical; package name is random.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with superficial obfuscation. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or malicious behavior is evident. The obfuscation appears intended to obscure variable names but does not introduce malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign, with superficial obfuscation and no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The obfuscation does not impact security but may be intended to obscure readability. Overall, the package poses minimal security concern.",
