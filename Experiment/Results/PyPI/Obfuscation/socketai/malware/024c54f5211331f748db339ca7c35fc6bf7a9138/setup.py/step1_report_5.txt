  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'gikqe7fxaliosz76'.",
  "sources": "Reads the current file path using os.path methods; defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data leaks observed; primarily uses standard setup utilities.",
  "flows": "Reads file path -> configures package setup with metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, unusual string assignments, no comments or documentation, and nonsensical variable names. The code does not perform any actions beyond package setup. No suspicious code execution, data leakage, or network activity is present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and 'os', uses obfuscated variable names to determine file paths, and calls 'setup()' with package metadata and dependencies. The variable names appear intentionally obscure, but the logic is standard for a setup script. There are no dynamic code executions, network communications, or data manipulations that suggest malicious activity. The setup parameters are typical, and no hardcoded credentials or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard package setup script with obfuscated variable names but no malicious behavior or security risks detected. The code performs basic package configuration without any signs of malware or security issues.",
