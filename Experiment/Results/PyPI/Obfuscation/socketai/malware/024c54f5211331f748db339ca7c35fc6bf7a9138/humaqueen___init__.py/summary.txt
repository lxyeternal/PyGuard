  "conclusion": "The code is highly malicious, designed for credential theft, data exfiltration, and potentially network attacks such as DDoS or trolling. Its obfuscated structure and suspicious functions justify high malware and security risk scores. Despite some incomplete segments, the overall pattern indicates malicious intent, warranting it to be flagged as dangerous."
