{
  "purpose": "The script appears to set up a Python package but also attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command, likely for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the filesystem (checking for 'tahg') and uses subprocess to execute an external PowerShell command encoded in base64.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen call executes a PowerShell command, which could be used to run arbitrary or malicious code on the system.",
  "flows": "Code checks for the existence of 'tahg' -> if not found, runs a PowerShell command via subprocess -> PowerShell command runs in hidden window.",
  "anomalies": "The PowerShell command is encoded and executed silently, which is suspicious. The code does not validate or log the command's purpose. Usage of try-except blocks without handling exceptions is also suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with a setup import, then checks for the existence of a specific directory. If absent, it executes a base64-encoded PowerShell command silently, which could be malicious. The setup function is called afterwards, indicating standard package setup code. The encoded command and silent execution are typical indicators of malicious or covert activity. The use of try-except blocks without error handling masks potential failures, further hiding malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a hidden PowerShell command executed silently, which is highly suspicious. The purpose appears to be executing arbitrary code without user consent or visibility. This behavior suggests malicious intent or sabotage within otherwise benign-looking setup code.",
