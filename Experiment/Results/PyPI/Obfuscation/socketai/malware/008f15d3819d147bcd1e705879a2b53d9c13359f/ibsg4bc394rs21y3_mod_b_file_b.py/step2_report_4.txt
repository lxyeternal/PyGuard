  "review": "Let's carefully analyze each report and the code in question.\n\n**Code Overview:**\n```python\ndef function_b():\n    print('This is function_b')\n```\nThis is a simple function that outputs a static message. It does not accept inputs, does not perform any data processing, and contains no external dependencies or suspicious constructs.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in code:** No, none of the reports identify any issues with the code. The code is straightforward and benign.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected; all reports agree on this.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation present.\n- **Security risk:** None.\n\n---\n\n### Review of the reports:\n\n**Reports 1-5** all describe the code as a benign, simple function that prints a static message. They mention no external input, no data flow, no anomalies, and no suspicious constructs. The confidence scores are all 1, indicating high certainty.\n\n**Errors or flaws in reasoning:**\n- No, all reports are consistent and accurate given the code.\n\n**Scores assigned:**\n- `obfuscated`: 0 — correct.\n- `malware`: 0 — correct.\n- `securityRisk`: 0 — correct.\n\n**Potential adjustments:**\n- The scores seem appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n- Since the code is trivial, there's no reason to assign any higher risk or malware scores.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- The risk score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n- Malware score is 0, indicating no malicious activity.\n- Obfuscated score is 0, indicating code clarity.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is entirely benign.\n- The reports are accurate in their conclusions.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:** The code is a simple, harmless function with no security concerns. The reports are thorough and correct. No adjustments needed.",
