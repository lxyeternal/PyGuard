  "review": "Let's carefully analyze each report and compare it against the original code:\n\n**Original Code:**\n```python\ndef function_b():\n    print('This is function_b')\n```\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the Issues\n- All reports describe a function that prints a static message, which matches the code.\n- There are no external inputs, data flows, or suspicious constructs in the code.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code is benign and straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### Reviewing the Scores and Reasoning\n\n**Obfuscated Score:** 0 in all reports  \n- Accurate, as the code is clear and simple.\n\n**Malware Score:** 0 in all reports  \n- Correct, since there's no malicious behavior, hidden code, or suspicious activity.\n\n**Security Risk Score:** 0 in all reports  \n- Justified, as the code does not pose any security risk.\n\n**Confidence:** 1 in all reports  \n- Appropriate, given the clear and benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Potential Issues in the Reports\n- The reports are consistent and thorough, with no logical flaws.\n- They all correctly conclude the code is harmless.\n- No changes needed in the scoring or analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification\n- The code is a trivial function that prints a static message.\n- No external dependencies, inputs, or outputs that could be exploited.\n- No obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- The scores reflect this accurately.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature. No further suspicion or concern is warranted.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code. The scores are appropriate, and there are no discrepancies or concerns to challenge.",
