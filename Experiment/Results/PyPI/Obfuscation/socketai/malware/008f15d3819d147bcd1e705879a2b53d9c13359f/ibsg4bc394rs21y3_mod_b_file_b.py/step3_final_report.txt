  "purpose": "A simple Python function that prints a static message, with no external inputs or malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs to standard output; no untrusted data is processed or leaked.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the function only outputs a static message.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function 'function_b' that prints a fixed string. All reports agree on its benign nature, with no external dependencies, data flows, or malicious intent. The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and benign behavior. No issues or anomalies are present, and the analysis confirms the code's harmlessness.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no security risks or malicious intent. The reports are accurate and consistent, and the scoring reflects the harmless nature of the code. No further action or concern is necessary.",
