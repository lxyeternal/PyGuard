  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \n   The original code is a simple function:\n   ```python\n   def function_b():\n       print('This is function_b')\n   ```\n   All reports agree that the code is straightforward, with no external input, no data flow, and no malicious or suspicious behavior. There are no signs of obfuscation, malware, or security risks. The code is benign and appears to be a placeholder or utility function.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is trivial, with no data flows, no external dependencies, and no malicious intent. No logical errors or flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, correctly indicating no security issues.\n\n   The scores seem reasonable and aligned with the code's characteristics.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \n   Since the code is entirely benign, no risk scores should be higher than 0.0. The reports' scores of 0 are justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \n   All reports are cautious and avoid assumptions; they correctly state that the code is harmless.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a simple, benign function with no security issues, malware, or obfuscation. The reports are accurate and consistent. No changes to scores are warranted.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is harmless; all scores should remain at 0.",
