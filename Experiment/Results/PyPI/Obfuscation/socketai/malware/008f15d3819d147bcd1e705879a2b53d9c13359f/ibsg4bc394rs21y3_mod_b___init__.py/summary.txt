  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with low security risks; report 4 shows moderate suspicion justified by obfuscation and potential malicious patterns. Overall, the scores are consistent with the evidence; minor adjustments could lean toward increased caution in report 4. Final malware score around 0.3-0.4, obfuscation 0.7, security risk 0.3, reflecting the current suspicion levels."
