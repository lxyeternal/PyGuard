  "flows": "Sources to sinks where untrusted data could lead to leaks or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code segments.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate benign code with no malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows. Malware scores are consistently zero, matching the absence of malicious activity. Obfuscation scores are zero, aligning with the lack of obfuscation. Security risk scores are uniformly 0.2, but given the benign assessments and limited context, a lower value of 0.1 is more appropriate. Confidence levels are moderate to high, reflecting cautious but positive evaluations. No significant anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected across the reports.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with minimal security concerns. Adjusting the security risk score from 0.2 to 0.1 across all reports better reflects the low threat level. No evidence supports higher malware or obfuscation scores. Overall, the assessments are consistent and justified.",
