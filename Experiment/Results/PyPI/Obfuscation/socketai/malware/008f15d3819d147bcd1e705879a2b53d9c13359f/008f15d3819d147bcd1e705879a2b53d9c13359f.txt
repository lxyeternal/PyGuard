      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits characteristics of a reconnaissance and exfiltration tool with stealth mechanisms and dependency management that could be exploited maliciously. While no direct payloads are present, its capabilities warrant high caution, especially in supply chain contexts. The scores assigned in the reports are generally appropriate, with malware around 0.6, obfuscation around 0.4-0.5, and security risk around 0.65-0.75, reflecting significant concern but not definitive malicious payloads."
