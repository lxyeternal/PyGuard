  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated network utility that manages proxy connections and URL parsing. While no explicit malicious payloads are present, the obfuscation and network capabilities suggest potential misuse. The malware score is low to moderate, and the security risk is moderate, primarily due to obfuscation and proxy handling features. Further dynamic analysis is recommended to confirm intent."
