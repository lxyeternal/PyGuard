  "conclusion": "This code is a heavily obfuscated SOCKS proxy client implementation with support for SOCKS4/5, no evident malicious payloads, and standard network handling. While the obfuscation warrants caution, there is no active malicious behavior detected. It could be misused if embedded maliciously, but the code itself appears legitimate."
