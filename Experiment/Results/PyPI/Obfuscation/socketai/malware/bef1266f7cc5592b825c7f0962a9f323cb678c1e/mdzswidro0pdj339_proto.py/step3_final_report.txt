{
  "purpose": "Implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy client protocols, supporting address resolution, authentication, and network communication.",
  "sources": "Network address resolution functions, socket connection and data transmission methods, input parameters for connection setup.",
  "sinks": "Socket send and receive functions, data serialization, and network communication channels.",
  "flows": "Source functions (address resolution, input parameters) flow into socket connection and data transmission functions, with error handling and protocol handshake steps.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with cryptic variable and class names, complex nested async functions, dynamic address handling, and lack of explicit hardcoded credentials.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a legitimate SOCKS proxy client supporting SOCKS4 and SOCKS5, with proper protocol handling, address resolution, and socket management. The obfuscation and complex structure are suspicious but do not directly indicate malicious behavior. No active payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident. The functions handle network data as expected for a proxy client, and error handling is appropriate. The high obfuscation level could be exploited to hide malicious intent, but based solely on static analysis, the code does not show malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a heavily obfuscated SOCKS proxy client implementation with support for SOCKS4/5, no evident malicious payloads, and standard network handling. While the obfuscation warrants caution, there is no active malicious behavior detected. It could be misused if embedded maliciously, but the code itself appears legitimate.",
