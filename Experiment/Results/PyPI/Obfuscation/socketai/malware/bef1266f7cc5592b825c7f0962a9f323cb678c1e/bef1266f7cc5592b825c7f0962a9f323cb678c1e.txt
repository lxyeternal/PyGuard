      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential, employing obfuscation, covert script execution, and external process invocation. Its behavior is characteristic of malware intended for remote control, data theft, or persistence. The high obfuscation and dynamic execution confirm malicious intent."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard module with obfuscated naming but no functional or malicious content. The reports are uninformative and do not provide evidence of security issues. Therefore, the dependency appears safe, with no indications of malware or vulnerabilities based on current data."

      "obfuscated": 0.8,
      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated network utility that manages proxy connections and URL parsing. While no explicit malicious payloads are present, the obfuscation and network capabilities suggest potential misuse. The malware score is low to moderate, and the security risk is moderate, primarily due to obfuscation and proxy handling features. Further dynamic analysis is recommended to confirm intent."

      "conclusion": "The code is a complex, obfuscated network configuration utility focused on proxy handling and DNS resolution. There is no evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The obfuscation warrants cautious review if used with untrusted inputs, but the current analysis indicates a benign purpose."

      "conclusion": "This code is a heavily obfuscated SOCKS proxy client implementation with support for SOCKS4/5, no evident malicious payloads, and standard network handling. While the obfuscation warrants caution, there is no active malicious behavior detected. It could be misused if embedded maliciously, but the code itself appears legitimate."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of obfuscated exception class definitions with no malicious or security risks. Obfuscation alone does not imply malicious intent, especially in the absence of active logic or data flow. The scores are appropriate; the overall assessment is that the code is safe."
