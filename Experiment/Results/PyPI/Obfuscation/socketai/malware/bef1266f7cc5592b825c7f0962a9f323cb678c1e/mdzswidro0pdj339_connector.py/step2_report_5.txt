  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Custom resolver and connector for network, proxy, DNS.\n- Findings: Reads proxy details, constructs URLs, no malicious behavior observed.\n- Confidence: 0.8, Obfuscated: 0.7, Malware: 0, Risk: 0.3\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly notes the absence of hardcoded secrets or malicious activity. The obfuscation is noted but deemed not malicious. The malware score of 0 aligns with the evidence. The risk score of 0.3 seems slightly high given the benign analysis, but considering the obfuscation and flexibility, it's acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Proxy handling, custom configurations.\n- Findings: Obfuscated names, complex URL formatting, no malicious actions.\n- Confidence: 0.7, Obfuscated: 0.8, Malware: 0, Risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the analysis is consistent. The high obfuscation score is justified, but no malicious activity is identified. Malware remains 0, and risk is low.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Proxy and network requests, dynamic configuration.\n- Findings: Obfuscation, dynamic URL formatting, no hardcoded secrets or malicious activity.\n- Confidence: 0.7, Obfuscated: 0.3, Malware: 0, Risk: 0.3\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe low obfuscation score here seems inconsistent with the previous reports. Given the code's obfuscated variable names and dynamic URL formatting, a higher obfuscation score (closer to 0.7) would be more appropriate. The malware and risk scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Proxy and DNS handling, possible obfuscation.\n- Findings: Obfuscated naming, dynamic URL formatting, no malicious activity.\n- Confidence: 0.6, Obfuscated: 0.7, Malware: 0.2, Risk: 0.3\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe malware score of 0.2 seems slightly high given the analysis. While obfuscation is present, no malicious activity is detected. A malware score of 0.1 would be more appropriate unless there's suspicion of hidden malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Proxy connector, network requests.\n- Findings: Obfuscation, no malicious behavior.\n- Confidence: 0.8, Obfuscated: 0.2, Malware: 0, Risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe obfuscation score is low here, which is consistent with the code being somewhat complex but not heavily obfuscated. The malware and risk scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary and Recommendations:\n\n- **Obfuscation scores** are generally justified, but **Report 3**'s obfuscation should be increased from 0.3 to about 0.7, aligning with the other reports.\n- **Malware scores** are consistently 0 or very low (0.2 at most). Given the code snippet, there's no evidence of malicious activity. The 0.2 malware score in Reports 4 and 5 might be slightly overstated; I recommend lowering it to 0.1.\n- **Risk scores** are moderate, reflecting potential for misuse due to obfuscation but no direct malicious activity.\n\n### Final Estimated Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0.1 (very low, no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.7 (consistent with code obfuscation)\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 (low, but some concern due to complexity and obfuscation)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code appears to be primarily for flexible network proxy configuration with obfuscation, but no evidence of malware or malicious intent. The scores should be adjusted slightly for consistency, especially increasing obfuscation and lowering malware scores where appropriate.",
