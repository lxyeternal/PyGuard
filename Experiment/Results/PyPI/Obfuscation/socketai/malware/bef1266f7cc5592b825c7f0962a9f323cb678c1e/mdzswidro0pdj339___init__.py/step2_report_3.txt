  "review": "Let's analyze this systematically.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:\n   - The provided code appears to be a typical Python module with imports, constants, and `__all__` definitions.\n   - No malicious or suspicious code, such as obfuscated logic, dynamic code execution, or network activity, is evident.\n   - The code snippet is standard and does not show any direct vulnerabilities or malware.\n\n2. **Review of the Reports**:\n   - All five reports contain only the message `\"error\": \"Empty response\"` with an empty `\"raw_response\"`.\n   - There is no detailed information, logs, or evidence provided about actual issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious activity.\n   - The reports seem to be placeholders or lack substantive content.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning**:\n   - The reports do not contain any reasoning, evidence, or technical details.\n   - Labeling all reports as \"Empty response\" without context suggests they are either incomplete or not useful for security assessment.\n   - No claims are made about specific vulnerabilities, malware, or code flaws.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - Since no concrete issues are identified, the malware score should be **0**.\n   - The obfuscated score should also be **0**, as there's no evidence of obfuscation.\n   - The risk score should be **0** unless there is some hidden or undisclosed malicious activity, which isn't indicated here.\n\n5. **Potential Malicious Activity or Vulnerabilities**:\n   - No evidence suggests malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n   - The code is straightforward and appears to be part of a network proxy or connector module.\n   - The reports do not provide any technical details that could indicate malware or vulnerabilities.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores**:\n   - Given the lack of evidence, assigning any risk or malware scores higher than 0.5 would be unreasonable.\n   - The reports do not justify any higher scores.\n\n7. **Overall Assessment**:\n   - The reports are essentially empty or uninformative.\n   - Without additional context or detailed logs, no suspicion can be raised.\n\n**Final Recommendations**:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary**:\nBased on the provided code and reports, there is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or risk. The reports lack substantive content, so the assessment remains that this dependency appears benign and safe.",
