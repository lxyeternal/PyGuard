{
  "purpose": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes, likely for use in a larger application for error handling.",
  "sources": "Class definitions without any data input or external data reading mechanisms.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only declares classes.",
  "anomalies": "Class names are obfuscated, consisting of random strings, which may suggest an attempt to hide intent. No functional code or logic is present.",
  "analysis": "The code only declares several custom exception classes, some inheriting from standard exceptions and others from a base obfuscated exception. There are no functions, methods, or executable code that process input, access environment variables, or perform any actions. The class names appear deliberately obfuscated, which can sometimes be a tactic to conceal malicious intent; however, without additional code, this is inconclusive. No hardcoded secrets, malicious operations, or suspicious behavior are evident. The code is minimal and does not execute or interact with external systems.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be simply defining obfuscated exception classes with no active behavior or malicious functionality. The obfuscation may be intended to conceal purpose, but based on this fragment alone, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security risk.",
