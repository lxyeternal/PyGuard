{
  "purpose": "Define multiple custom exception classes, mostly inheriting from a base exception class.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data sources; only class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling, I/O, or network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; classes are purely declarative.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual class names that appear obfuscated or randomly generated; no meaningful logic or behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes with obscure, seemingly random names. All classes inherit from either built-in exceptions or a base exception class, without any methods or logic. There are no data inputs, no external interactions, and no suspicious operations. The obfuscated or random class names could be an attempt to hide malicious intent, but on their own, they are not malicious. The code does not perform any actions, data processing, or network communication. This appears to be a set of placeholder or obfuscated exception definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The obscure class names may suggest an attempt to hide intent, but without any executable logic or external interactions, there is no evidence of malicious activity. It is likely benign, serving as exception definitions.",
