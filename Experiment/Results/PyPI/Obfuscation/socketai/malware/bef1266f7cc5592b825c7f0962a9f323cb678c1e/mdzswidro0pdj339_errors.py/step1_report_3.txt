{
  "purpose": "Define multiple custom exception classes, inheriting from standard exceptions.",
  "sources": "No external data input or data reading sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sink points such as network operations, file writes, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only defines classes without data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Use of non-descriptive, randomly generated class names, but no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of class definitions for custom exceptions, all inheriting from built-in exception classes or other custom exceptions. There are no operations, data manipulations, or external interactions. The naming appears to be random or obfuscated but does not imply malicious behavior. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. The code structure is straightforward and typical for defining custom exception hierarchies. The absence of any code executing external commands, network operations, or data processing indicates no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be benign, merely defining custom exception classes with obfuscated names. There is no evidence of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
