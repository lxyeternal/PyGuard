{
  "purpose": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes with obfuscated or nonsensical class names, inheriting from standard exceptions or a base custom exception, with no executable logic or data handling.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and inheritance statements; no input, output, or external data interactions.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; code is purely structural.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class names that appear randomly generated; no functional code or logic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class declarations for custom exceptions with obfuscated names, inheriting from standard exception classes. There are no data inputs, outputs, network activity, or logic that could be exploited. The obfuscation is superficial, likely for concealment or to hinder readability, but does not indicate malicious intent. The absence of data flows, external interactions, or payloads confirms benign nature. Scores assigned in the reports—malware 0, obfuscation high (~0.8), low security risk (~0.1)—are consistent with this analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of obfuscated exception class definitions with no malicious or security risks. Obfuscation alone does not imply malicious intent, especially in the absence of active logic or data flow. The scores are appropriate; the overall assessment is that the code is safe.",
