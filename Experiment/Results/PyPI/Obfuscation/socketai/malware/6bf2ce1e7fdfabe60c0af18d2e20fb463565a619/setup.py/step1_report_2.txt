  "purpose": "The code appears to define a setup configuration for a Python package, including custom install and develop commands that execute external code during installation or development setup.",
  "sources": "Base64-encoded string in function VvXmoFrHjJWEkXfABIqBdgPRDKPqCQmV, which is decoded and executed via os.system in BrRWMvbgGbmIkBXJdrKqYfsvGkSmgWPJ.",
  "sinks": "os.system call that executes decoded base64 string as shell command.",
  "flows": "VvXmoFrHjJWEkXfABIqBdgPRDKPqCQmV decodes base64 string → BrRWMvbgGbmIkBXJdrKqYfsvGkSmgWPJ calls VvXmoFrHjJWEkXfABIqBdgPRDKPqCQmV → os.system executes command",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding and execution of decoded string via os.system during package setup. The base64 string decodes to a curl command fetching and executing code from an external URL, which is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup tools modules and defines functions for decoding base64 encoded strings. The function VvXmoFrHjJWEkXfABIqBdgPRDKPqCQmV decodes base64 string into ASCII, which is then executed in BrRWMvbgGbmIkBXJdrKqYfsvGkSmgWPJ via os.system. The base64 string decodes to a shell command that performs an HTTP request to a suspicious URL and executes the response as a script, indicating malicious intent. The custom command classes call this function during 'develop' and 'install' commands, meaning the potentially malicious code executes automatically during package setup, representing a supply chain attack vector.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains malicious behavior, executing code fetched from an external source during installation or development setup. The code is intentionally obfuscated through base64 encoding, which raises suspicion. The overall security risk is high, and the package should not be used.",
