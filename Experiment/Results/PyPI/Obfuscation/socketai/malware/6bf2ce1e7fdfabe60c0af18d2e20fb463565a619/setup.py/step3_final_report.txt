{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup commands that execute remote code during installation or development, specifically decoding a base64 string to run a curl command fetching content from an ngrok URL, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Base64-encoded string decoded in function VvXmoFrHjJWEkXfABIqBdgPRDKPqCQmV, which is then executed via os.system.",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing the decoded remote curl command.",
  "flows": "Decoding base64 string -> executing the resulting curl command via os.system.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function and variable names, base64 encoding of the URL, execution of remote commands during setup, contact to suspicious ngrok URL.",
  "analysis": "The code contains obfuscated functions that decode a base64 string, which translates to a curl command fetching and executing remote content from an ngrok URL. This command is run during the custom install and develop commands, indicating remote code execution at setup time. The obfuscation and external URL contact are typical of malicious supply chain attacks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware, obfuscation, and security risk) are consistent with this behavior, with high values justified by the active remote code fetch and execution, obfuscation, and potential for system compromise.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates malicious behavior through remote code execution during package setup, with obfuscation and contact to suspicious URLs. It should be classified as highly malicious, representing a severe security threat.",
