{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configurations for a Python package, with some custom commands that execute a base64-encoded URL.",
  "sources": "Base64 string within the function VvXmoFrHjJWEkXfABIqBdgPRDKPqCQmV and its subsequent decoding and execution within system calls.",
  "sinks": "os.system() calls executing decoded base64 content, which involves running external commands or URLs.",
  "flows": "The base64 string is decoded in VvXmoFrHjJWEkXfABIqBdgPRDKPqCQmV and passed to os.system(), executing the decoded command or URL.",
  "anomalies": "The presence of obfuscated base64-encoded strings that are decoded at runtime and executed via os.system()—a common pattern for malicious payloads. Custom classes that invoke these functions during package installation or development.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools for package setup and defines functions with obfuscated names. The function VvXmoFrHjJWEkXfABIqBdgPRDKPqCQmV decodes a base64 string, which appears to be a URL or command. The functions BrRWMvbgGbmIkBXJdrKqYfsvGkSmgWPJ, called during installation or development, execute this decoded string via os.system(). The base64 string decodes to a URL ('https://ac9c-54-204-140-51.ngrok-free.app') which suggests the code attempts to contact an external server during package install or develop phases. This pattern is suspicious as it indicates potential malicious command execution or remote communication during package setup, a common tactic to fetch or execute malicious code remotely. The use of obfuscated variable and function names further indicates an attempt to conceal intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated base64-encoded commands executed during package setup, which contact an external URL. This behavior is suspicious and potentially malicious, indicating a possible supply chain attack or malicious backdoor embedded in the package. The script could be used to run malicious code on the target system during installation or development.",
