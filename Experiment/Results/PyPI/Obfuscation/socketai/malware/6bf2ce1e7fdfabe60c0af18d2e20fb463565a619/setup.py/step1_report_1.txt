{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a setup script for a Python package, including custom install and develop commands, and some obfuscated functions that execute a remote script.",
  "sources": "Base64-encoded string within the BrRWMvbgGbmIkBXJdrKqYfsvGkSmgWPJ function, which is decoded and then executed via os.system.",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing decoded base64 payload, which potentially runs malicious code downloaded from an external URL.",
  "flows": "The base64 string is decoded in VvXmoFrHjJWEkXfABIqBdgPRDKPqCQmV, then passed to os.system in BrRWMvbgGbmIkBXJdrKqYfsvGkSmgWPJ, executing remote content.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding functions, obfuscated function and variable names, executing decoded string via os.system, which is suspicious; no clear reason for such obfuscation in legitimate package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools and defines two custom command classes that invoke a function which executes a remote URL encoded in base64. The URL points to 'https://a9c-54-204-140-51.ngrok-free.app', which is suspicious because ngrok is often used for tunneling malicious activity. The code structure is obfuscated with random function and variable names, and uses base64 encoding to hide the URL being executed. This indicates an attempt to run remote code during installation or development, representing a high risk of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains obfuscated code that decodes and executes a remote script during install or development commands, indicating malicious intent or supply chain attack potential. The use of base64 encoding and remote execution is a common malware tactic. Therefore, this code should be considered malicious and dangerous for use.",
