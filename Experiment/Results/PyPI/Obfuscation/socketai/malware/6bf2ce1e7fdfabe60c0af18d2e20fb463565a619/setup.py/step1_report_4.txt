{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be setting up a Python package using setuptools, with custom install and develop commands.",
  "sources": "Base64 encoded string in the function VvXmoFrHjJWEkXfABIqBdgPRDKPqCQmV, which is decoded and executed via os.system.",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing decoded commands from the base64 string, potentially running arbitrary commands.",
  "flows": "Base64 string decoded in VvXmoFrHjJWEkXfABIqBdgPRDKPqCQmV → executed via os.system in BrRWMvbgGbmIkBXJdrKqYfsvGkSmgWPJ → invoked in custom develop and install commands.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated functions and variable names; base64-encoded command executed through system call; code structure suggests hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script uses base64 decoding to obfuscate a command that is then executed via os.system, which is often a sign of malicious or covert activity. The functions are intentionally obfuscated with meaningless variable names, hiding the true intent. The setup script defines custom commands for development and installation that trigger this encoded command, indicating a potential backdoor or malicious payload. The base64 string decodes to a curl command fetching content from a suspicious URL and executing it, which is a common tactic to execute remote malicious code. The rest of the code appears normal for a setup script but is overshadowed by this malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, malicious behavior, specifically executing a remote command fetched from a URL during package install or development setup. This indicates a high risk of supply chain attack or malware. The overall security risk is high, and this package should not be used without thorough investigation.",
