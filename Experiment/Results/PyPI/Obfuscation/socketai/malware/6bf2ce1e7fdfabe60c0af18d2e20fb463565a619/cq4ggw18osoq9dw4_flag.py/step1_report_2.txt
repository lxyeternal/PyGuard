  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; function only outputs a static message.",
  "anomalies": "The function name appears obfuscated or randomly generated, but this alone is not suspicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function with a seemingly random name that prints 'Hello, World!'. There are no external data inputs, no network communication, and no suspicious behaviors observed. The function does nothing harmful or unusual; it is a trivial, benign piece of code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, simple print function with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscated-looking function name does not imply malicious intent in this context.",
