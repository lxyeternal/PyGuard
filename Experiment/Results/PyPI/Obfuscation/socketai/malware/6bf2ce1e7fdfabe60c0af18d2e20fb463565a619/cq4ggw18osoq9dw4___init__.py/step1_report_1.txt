{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform some data processing or computation, but without additional context or documentation, the exact intent is unclear.",
  "sources": "Input is read from the 'input_data' variable or external sources such as environment variables or function parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include data output functions, network transmission points, file writes, or system commands executed via subprocess or os.system.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (e.g., 'input_data', environment variables, or user input) through processing functions to output or transmission points.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual features include the use of dynamic code execution (e.g., eval, exec), obfuscated variable names, or hardcoded credentials. The code contains conditional logic that obscures straightforward analysis. There are no explicit hardcoded secrets or suspicious network domains detected.",
  "analysis": "The code reads data from several sources, potentially including environment variables and function inputs. It performs data processing, possibly involving dynamic execution or reflection, which can be a sign of obfuscation. There are no clear indicators of malicious activity like network communication to suspicious domains, data exfiltration, or system modifications. However, the presence of dynamic code execution constructs warrants caution. The structure suggests potential for malicious behavior if inputs are untrusted, but no definitive malicious payload is observed.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the current analysis, the code does not exhibit clear malicious behavior but contains elements (like dynamic execution and obfuscated variables) that could be exploited for malicious purposes if misused. The risk level is moderate pending further context or analysis of runtime behavior.",
