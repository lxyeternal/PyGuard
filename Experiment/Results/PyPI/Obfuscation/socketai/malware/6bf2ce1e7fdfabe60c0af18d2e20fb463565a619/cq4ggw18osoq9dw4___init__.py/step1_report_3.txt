{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for data processing or utility functions, but the specific purpose cannot be conclusively determined due to lack of context.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include environment variables and possibly external data files or network inputs if present; however, the provided code snippet does not specify explicit data sources.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, file operations, network requests, or data output functions, but no explicit sinks are evident in the code snippet provided.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources such as environment variables or data files to processing functions and then to output or system interfaces; specific flow paths cannot be fully identified without further code context.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious functions, or unusual code constructs are evident. The code uses standard Python features and appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and appears to consist of standard Python constructs without obfuscated or suspicious patterns. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network connections to suspicious domains, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The lack of explicit input/output or network code limits assessment, but nothing indicates malicious intent. No security issues like code injection or insecure handling are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign and standard in nature. However, due to limited context, a low confidence level is assigned.",
