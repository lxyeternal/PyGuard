      "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, stealthy execution of a PowerShell command during package setup, indicating malicious intent. The use of encoding, hidden execution, and conditional logic suggests an attempt to conceal malicious activity, making it highly suspicious and dangerous. Further decoding of the payload is recommended to confirm malicious actions, but the current evidence justifies classifying this as malicious with high severity."
