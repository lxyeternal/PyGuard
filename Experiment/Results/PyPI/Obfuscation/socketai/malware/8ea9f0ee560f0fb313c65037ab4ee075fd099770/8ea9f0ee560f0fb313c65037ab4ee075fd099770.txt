      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential as a remote code execution vector, functioning as a backdoor or supply chain attack component. It downloads and executes untrusted code without validation, disables SSL verification, and uses hardcoded IP addresses, making it highly insecure and dangerous. The behavior justifies a malware score of approximately 0.9 and a security risk score of about 0.95. The code is not heavily obfuscated, so an obfuscation score of around 0.2 is appropriate. Overall, this code should be flagged as malicious and removed from any distribution channels."

      "conclusion": "The code is a utility for deferred execution supporting both sync and async functions. It is free of malicious activity, with obfuscated naming but no malicious intent. The primary security concern is the potential for misuse if the deferred functions are untrusted, but the code itself is safe."

      "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a package initializer with obfuscation techniques that could conceal malicious intent. No direct malicious activity is detected, but the obfuscation and extensive star-imports suggest potential concealment tactics. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; a slightly higher malware suspicion (e.g., 0.2) is justified given the obfuscation and star-imports, but overall, the security risk remains low."

No concrete evidence of malware or supply chain attack is detected. The high obfuscation warrants caution, but static analysis does not reveal malicious payloads. The overall risk is moderate, primarily due to the potential for misuse through obfuscation and complex signal handling."
