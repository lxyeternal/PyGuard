  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, albeit complex and obfuscated, process and signal management framework for asyncio-based worker orchestration. No concrete evidence of malware or supply chain attack is detected. The high obfuscation warrants caution, but static analysis does not reveal malicious payloads. The overall risk is moderate, primarily due to the potential for misuse through obfuscation and complex signal handling."
