{
  "purpose": "An async generator function that iterates over an async iterable or repeatedly calls an async function until a sentinel value is encountered.",
  "sources": "Reads from the async iterable 'obj' via 'async for' or calls 'await obj()' repeatedly.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Source (async for or await obj()) -> yield; loop until sentinel is matched.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated variable and function names; a unique object used as sentinel; no input validation or external calls.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a utility for flexible async iteration, handling both async iterables and awaitable functions with a sentinel for termination. No network, file, or system modifications are evident. Obfuscation is superficial, primarily variable naming, not malicious. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious patterns are present. The pattern could be misused if 'obj' is malicious, but the code itself is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for async iteration with superficial obfuscation. No evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not indicate malicious intent. Overall security risk is low.",
