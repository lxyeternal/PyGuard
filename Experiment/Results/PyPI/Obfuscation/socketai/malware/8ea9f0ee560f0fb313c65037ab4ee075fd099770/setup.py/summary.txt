  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential as a remote code execution vector, functioning as a backdoor or supply chain attack component. It downloads and executes untrusted code without validation, disables SSL verification, and uses hardcoded IP addresses, making it highly insecure and dangerous. The behavior justifies a malware score of approximately 0.9 and a security risk score of about 0.95. The code is not heavily obfuscated, so an obfuscation score of around 0.2 is appropriate. Overall, this code should be flagged as malicious and removed from any distribution channels."
