  "purpose": "Setup and install a Python package, then dynamically download, extract, and execute a remote script.",
  "sources": "Input sources include command line arguments (argv), remote URL request, and environment data (temporary directory, executable path).",
  "sinks": "Execution of a downloaded zip archive as a Python script via system call; writing logs to temp file; creating directories; fetching remote content.",
  "flows": "Command line args -> control flow to proceed with setup; URL request -> read zip data -> extract -> execute main.py from extracted files.",
  "anomalies": "Downloads and executes a remote zip file containing Python code without verification, which can be malicious. Uses SSL context with verification disabled. Hardcoded IP address and URL. Writes logs to temp directory. Executes extracted code directly.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with standard setup code for a Python package. It then verifies command line arguments to proceed only for 'install' or 'bdist'. It creates a temporary directory with a random token hex. It disables SSL verification and fetches a remote zip file from a hardcoded IP address. The zip file is extracted into the temporary directory. Then, it runs a 'main.py' script from the extracted contents via a system call, which is a significant risk because the remote code can be malicious. All network and file operations are performed with minimal security checks, and the remote URL is hardcoded and not verified. It logs any errors to a temp log file. This process resembles a supply chain attack or remote code execution mechanism embedded in a package that can be triggered during installation, posing a serious security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code downloads and executes remote code from a hardcoded URL without verification, enabling potential malicious activity such as remote code execution. The remote code is not validated, creating high security risk, especially in supply chain contexts.",
