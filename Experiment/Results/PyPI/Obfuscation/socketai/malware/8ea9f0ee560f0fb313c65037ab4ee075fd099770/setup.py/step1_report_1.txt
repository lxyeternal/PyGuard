{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be a setup or installation script for a Python package, which downloads and executes additional code from a remote server.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'README.md' file, command-line arguments (argv), and network request to a remote URL.",
  "sinks": "Executes downloaded code using system call, writes logs to temporary directory, extracts ZIP archive.",
  "flows": "Reads package information and command-line args → Downloads ZIP from remote URL → Extracts ZIP contents → Executes 'main.py' from extracted contents → Cleans up temporary directory.",
  "anomalies": "Dynamically constructs a URL pointing to an external server with an IP address, uses insecure SSL context (CERT_NONE), executes arbitrary Python code via system call, writes logs to temp directory, downloads ZIP archive and executes contained script, no verification of downloaded content.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a Python package configuration with setuptools, then proceeds to conditionally execute code based on command-line arguments. It constructs a temporary directory path using a secure token, disables SSL verification, and downloads a ZIP archive from a remote server with a hardcoded IP address, bypassing SSL verification. The ZIP is extracted into the temporary directory, and a script named 'main.py' is executed from this directory. If any error occurs, it logs the exception details into a file in the temp directory. The code does not verify the authenticity or integrity of the downloaded archive, nor does it restrict the executed code, leading to high risk of malicious code execution from an untrusted source.",
  "conclusion": "This script is potentially malicious, as it downloads and executes code from an external IP address without validation, disables SSL security, and executes arbitrary scripts. It likely functions as a backdoor or remote code execution agent, representing a high security risk.",
