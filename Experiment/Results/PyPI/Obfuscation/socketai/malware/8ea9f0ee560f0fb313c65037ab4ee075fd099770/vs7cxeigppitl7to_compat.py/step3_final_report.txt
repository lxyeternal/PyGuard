  "purpose": "Compatibility shim for asyncio functions across different Python versions, performing attribute existence checks and assigning references accordingly.",
  "sources": "Attribute existence checks on the asyncio module, reading attribute presence via hasattr.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, no external data or untrusted input handling, no network or file operations.",
  "flows": "Attribute checks lead to variable assignments; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; nonsensical attribute references in else blocks (e.g., asyncio.FsXWvLjyUepqdTGtVqnBDeAoAwKbYWLH) which do not correspond to standard asyncio attributes.",
  "analysis": "The code performs feature detection for asyncio functions to ensure compatibility across Python versions. Variable names are obfuscated, which is suspicious but not inherently malicious. The attribute references in the else blocks are non-standard and may cause runtime errors if used later. No malicious operations, data leaks, or network activity are present. The obfuscation suggests either auto-generated code or an attempt to hide complexity, but the core logic remains benign. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, low security risk, high obfuscation) are consistent with this assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign compatibility layer with obfuscated variable names. No evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities is present. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not constitute malicious activity.",
