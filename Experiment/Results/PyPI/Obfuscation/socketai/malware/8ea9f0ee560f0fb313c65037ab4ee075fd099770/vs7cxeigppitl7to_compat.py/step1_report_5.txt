{
  "purpose": "The code aims to assign asyncio functions or attributes to local variables based on the presence of certain attributes in the asyncio module, likely for compatibility across different Python versions.",
  "sources": "Checks for the existence of asyncio attributes: 'get_running_loop', 'all_tasks', 'current_task'. Uses these attributes or fallback properties of asyncio or asyncio.Task.",
  "sinks": "Assignment to local variables; no untrusted data handling or external output observed.",
  "flows": "The presence of attribute checks directs assignment to local variables, but there are no data flows involving external untrusted sources or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The variable names appear obfuscated or auto-generated, with unusual naming patterns. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns detected. The code is somewhat redundant, but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs feature detection for asyncio functions to ensure compatibility across different Python versions. The use of attribute checks and fallback assignments is standard. No external input, no suspicious data handling, no obfuscated logic designed to hide malicious intent. The naming appears intentionally obscure but does not indicate malicious behavior. No code injection, data leaks, or network activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a compatibility layer for asyncio functions across Python versions. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscated variable names do not signify malicious intent, merely obscure code readability. Overall, it is benign.",
