  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, heavily obfuscated caching utility with no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain security issues. The high obfuscation score (0.8) is justified, while malware likelihood remains zero. The overall security risk is low (0.2), primarily due to obfuscation, but no active threats are identified."
