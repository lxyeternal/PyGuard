{
  "purpose": "The code provides asynchronous caching decorators with support for size limits and expiration, intended to optimize function performance by caching results.",
  "sources": "Function arguments, system time via imported compatibility module, cache key generation functions.",
  "sinks": "In-memory cache dictionary operations, cache expiration timestamp updates.",
  "flows": "Input arguments are used to generate cache keys; cache entries are stored with expiration timestamps; cache hits retrieve stored values; cache misses trigger function execution and cache update.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of variable and function names, import from '.compat' with non-descriptive name, placeholder functions, and nested internal functions. No hardcoded secrets or external malicious communications detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard in-memory cache with expiration and size management for async functions. Obfuscated identifiers suggest an attempt to hinder reverse engineering but do not indicate malicious intent. No external data transmission, no system modifications, and no malicious patterns such as network activity or data exfiltration are present. The cache logic aligns with common patterns, and the obfuscation appears to be a form of code concealment rather than malicious sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, heavily obfuscated caching utility with no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain security issues. The high obfuscation score (0.8) is justified, while malware likelihood remains zero. The overall security risk is low (0.2), primarily due to obfuscation, but no active threats are identified.",
