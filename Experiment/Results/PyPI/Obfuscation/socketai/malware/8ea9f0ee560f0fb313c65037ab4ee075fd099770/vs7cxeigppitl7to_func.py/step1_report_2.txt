{
  "purpose": "This module provides caching decorators and utility functions for asynchronous functions, including an LRU cache implementation with expiration support.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters from function calls, including cache size, expiration times, and function arguments. It also imports modules for collections, functools, and a compatibility module.",
  "sinks": "The code does not appear to write or transmit untrusted data directly. No network, file system, or external data sink is evident. Cache storage is local.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (maxsize, expiration) influence cache behavior; function arguments flow into cache key generation; cached entries are stored with expiration times; cache eviction occurs when size limits are exceeded.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names (e.g., UYuEVCuJZTtxJdmXMflfLyOJgiCcvIMl, gzrbhAcdELSFGLNoIBeIVkhiWSylllPQ). The code uses non-descriptive identifiers, which may hinder understanding but are not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a namedtuple for cache entries, an asynchronous wrapper decorator, and a configurable LRU cache decorator with expiration support. It manages cache entries via an OrderedDict, handling size limits and expiration times. The code imports standard libraries and a compatibility module, with no suspicious external connections or data exfiltration. The obfuscated identifiers could be an attempt to hide intent but are common in intentionally obscured code. No malicious actions such as network activity, file manipulation, or data theft are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, albeit obfuscated, implementation of an asynchronous cache with expiration support. There are no evident malicious behaviors or supply chain security issues. The obfuscation does not directly indicate malicious intent but warrants cautious review if used in security-critical contexts.",
