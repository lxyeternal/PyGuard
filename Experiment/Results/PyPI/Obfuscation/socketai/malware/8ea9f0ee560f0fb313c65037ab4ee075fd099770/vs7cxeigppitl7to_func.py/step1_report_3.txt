  "purpose": "This code provides caching decorators and utilities, including an async cache wrapper, a cache implementation with size and expiration control, and a placeholder for a partial function.",
  "sources": "Reads include collections for data structures, functools for decorators, and a local compat module for possibly environment-specific functions. The code also reads input parameters such as maxsize, typed, expire_after, and function arguments.",
  "sinks": "Potential sink points are in the cache storage (OrderedDict), and in the async wrapper that calls the coroutine with preserved arguments. No unsafe external data sinks (e.g., network, file, environment variable access) are evident.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to configure the cache (maxsize, expiration). The cache keys are generated via functools._make_key from function args and kwargs. Cached data is stored in an OrderedDict. Data retrieval and update happen through get, set, and delete operations within the cache. The async wrapper manages cache lookup and update logic.",
  "anomalies": "Use of internal and private functions (_make_key, __delitem__, __setitem__, etc.) is typical for internal cache management. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic is evident. The code's structure appears standard for an in-memory cache implementation. The presence of placeholder functions like EvKCGWYWVPPqwmawpMcrPvHXETOpjWzU and method assignments seem benign.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a named tuple for cache entries, an async wrapper to preserve metadata, and a cache factory function 'kBoLwKkCaUPwHtAPkxziyRpQyfQvYOIX' that creates a cache decorator with size and expiration parameters. The cache uses an OrderedDict to maintain insertion order, supporting size limits and optional expiration times. The cache key is generated with functools._make_key, which could be internal but is a common pattern in cache implementations. No external data is transmitted, and no external system calls or network operations are present. The code appears to implement a standard, configurable in-memory cache with no malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate caching utility with configurable size and expiration, using standard Python data structures and practices. No malicious behavior, backdoors, data leaks, or suspicious external interactions are identified. The code's complexity and structure are consistent with normal cache implementations.",
