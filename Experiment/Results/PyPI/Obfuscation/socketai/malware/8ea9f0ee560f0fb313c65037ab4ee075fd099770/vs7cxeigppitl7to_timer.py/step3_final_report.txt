  "purpose": "Utility functions and classes for asyncio timers, event loop mocking, primarily for testing and simulation purposes.",
  "sources": "Function parameters, internal asyncio tasks, patched event loop methods ('select' and 'time') via mock.patch.object.",
  "sinks": "Callback functions invoked within asyncio tasks, patched event loop methods affecting 'select' and 'time'.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (parameters, internal state) lead to scheduled asyncio tasks, which invoke callbacks; patched methods influence event loop behavior during testing.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of class and variable names, patching core event loop methods, presence of nonsensical code snippets (e.g., 'bpfAnqUzzuXnKuVxelFSlZpmbJjHggDO=True') that may be errors or deliberate obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code creates recurring asyncio timers with configurable delay policies, using obfuscated identifiers and patching event loop methods for testing. No malicious payloads, network activity, or data exfiltration are evident. The obfuscation and patching are typical in testing utilities but could be misused if embedded maliciously. The typo in 'bpfAnqUzzuXnKuVxelFSlZpmbJjHggDO=True' suggests possible obfuscation artifacts or errors. Overall, the code appears benign, intended for controlled testing environments, with low malware risk but high obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a testing utility for asyncio timers and event loop manipulation, with obfuscated naming and patching techniques. No malicious activity is detected. The low malware score (0.1) and high obfuscation score (0.8) are appropriate. The security risk remains low (~0.2), but caution is advised if used outside controlled testing contexts.",
