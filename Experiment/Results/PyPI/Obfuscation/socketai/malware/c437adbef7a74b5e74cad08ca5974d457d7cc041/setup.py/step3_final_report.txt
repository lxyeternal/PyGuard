{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package and then downloads multiple ZIP files from a suspicious domain, extracts their contents, deletes the ZIP files, and finally fetches a remote payload, decodes it from base64, and executes it dynamically.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for package metadata; URLs from which ZIP files and payloads are downloaded; remote URL for final payload",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlretrieve (file downloads); zipfile.ZipFile extraction; exec(base64.b64decode(...)) for remote code execution",
  "flows": "Download ZIP files from remote URLs -> extract and delete ZIPs -> download payload from remote URL -> decode payload from base64 -> execute payload via exec()",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; multiple unvalidated remote downloads; extraction of ZIP files without checksum or signature verification; use of exec() on remote, decoded code",
  "analysis": "The code performs multiple suspicious activities: it downloads ZIP files from a suspicious domain, extracts them without validation, and executes remote code via base64 decoding and exec(). The obfuscated variable names and lack of validation strongly suggest malicious intent. The remote code execution pattern is a hallmark of malware or supply chain attacks. The high-risk behavior, including remote code execution without validation, indicates a high probability of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits highly malicious behavior, including remote code download, extraction, and execution without validation, with obfuscated variables. It is consistent with malware or supply chain sabotage, posing a severe security threat.",
