{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package and then download, extract, and execute additional code from remote URLs, potentially malicious.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file; URLs from which ZIP files and base64-encoded code are retrieved; potentially untrusted remote server.",
  "sinks": "Execution of base64-decoded code via exec(), writing and extracting ZIP files from remote sources.",
  "flows": "Reading README -> downloading ZIP files -> extracting files -> deleting ZIPs -> downloading additional package data -> executing decoded code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obscure variable names; multiple remote downloads; extraction and immediate deletion of ZIP files; execution of remote code via exec(base64.b64decode()). These are signs of obfuscation and malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools and reads a README file, then proceeds to download multiple ZIP files from a suspicious domain, extracting their contents, and deleting the ZIP files afterward. It repeats this process for several dependencies, indicating possible setup or payload delivery. At the end, it retrieves a base64-encoded payload from a remote URL, decodes it, and executes it with exec(), which is a highly suspicious behavior indicating potential malware execution. The variable names are intentionally obfuscated, and the repeated pattern of remote downloads and immediate execution suggest malicious intent. The script does not perform any validation of the downloaded content or the decoded code, increasing the risk of executing malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates malicious behavior, including remote code retrieval, obfuscation, and execution without validation. It likely aims to execute malicious code on the host system, representing a security threat.",
