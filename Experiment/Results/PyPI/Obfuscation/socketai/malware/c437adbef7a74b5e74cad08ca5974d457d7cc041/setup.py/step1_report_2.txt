{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package, download multiple ZIP files from external URLs, extract them, and then execute dynamically retrieved code. The main purpose seems to be package setup and executing remote code.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file; retrieving files from remote URLs ('getcrypto', 'getpsutil', etc.); fetching a base64-encoded package from a remote URL and executing it.",
  "sinks": "exec(base64.b64decode(...)): executes code retrieved from remote server; urllib.request.urlopen() and urllib.request.urlretrieve() fetching potentially malicious content; removal of ZIP files after extraction, which could be used to obfuscate malicious files.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md -> downloading ZIP files from URLs -> extracting ZIP files -> fetching remote base64-encoded code -> decoding and executing the code.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual use of multiple downloads from untrusted sources, particularly from a suspicious domain 'pythonanywhere.com' which may be legitimate but combined with remote execution raises suspicion. Dynamic execution of remote code via 'exec(base64.b64decode(...))'. No validation or verification of downloaded code or its source. The code does not perform any explicit validation or checksum checks on downloaded files.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with package setup and reads a local README.md file. It then proceeds to download several ZIP files from a suspicious domain, extracts their contents, and deletes the ZIP files. This pattern indicates potential code injection or malicious payload delivery. Later, it fetches additional data from a remote URL, decodes it from base64, and executes it directly using 'exec()', which is highly suspicious. This pattern suggests remote code execution, possibly to run malicious scripts or payloads. The code does not include any validation, sandboxing, or safeguards, increasing the risk. The overall pattern aligns with typical malicious behaviors such as remote code execution and dynamic payload delivery.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious intent due to remote code retrieval, execution, and extraction of potentially malicious payloads. The use of 'exec()' on remote data without validation is a major security concern. Overall, this code is likely malicious or at best highly unsafe, with potential for remote exploitation or malware deployment.",
