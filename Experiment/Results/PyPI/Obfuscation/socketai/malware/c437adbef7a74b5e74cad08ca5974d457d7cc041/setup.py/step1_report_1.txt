  "purpose": "Set up a Python package named 'testingiavv' and dynamically download, extract, and execute additional code or payloads from remote servers.",
  "sources": [
    "Reading 'README.md' file",
    "Retrieving files from specified URLs (e.g., getcrypto, getpsutil, geturllib3, getcharset, getidna, getcertifi, getrequests, getpackage)"

  "sinks": [
    "exec(base64.b64decode(...)) - executes code downloaded from remote server",
    "urllib.request.urlopen() - fetches remote code for execution",
    "Downloading and extracting zip files from URLs"
  ],
  "flows": [
    "Read 'README.md' -> set up package metadata",
    "Download files from remote URLs -> save as zip files",
    "Extract zip files -> delete zip files",
    "Download another payload from a URL -> decode base64 -> execute code"
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "Dynamic code retrieval from external URLs without validation or verification",
    "Unusual variable names that are nonsensical",
    "Multiple downloads from suspicious domain ('frvezdffvv.pythonanywhere.com')",
    "Executing code directly from decoded remote payloads via 'exec' without any security checks",
    "Overly obfuscated code segments (base64 decoding and exec)"
  ],
  "analysis": "The script sets up a Python package configuration with metadata. It then proceeds to download multiple ZIP files from a suspicious domain, extracts their contents, and deletes the ZIP files—these could contain malicious modules or malware payloads. The final step retrieves additional code from a remote URL, decodes it from base64, and executes it dynamically, which is highly risky. The usage of 'exec' on remote code signifies a high likelihood of malicious intent, including potential backdoors, system compromise, or data exfiltration. The domain used for downloads appears suspicious and could be used to deliver malware or updates malicious payloads. Overall, the code exhibits behaviors typical of malicious supply chain attacks or remote malware deployment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious due to its dynamic remote code execution, multiple unverified downloads, and obfuscated behavior. It demonstrates strong malicious intent, likely aiming to infect or control the host system. It should be considered dangerous and unsafe for use.",
