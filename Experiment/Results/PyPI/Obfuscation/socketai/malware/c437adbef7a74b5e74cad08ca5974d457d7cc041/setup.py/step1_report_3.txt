  "purpose": "To set up a Python package and dynamically download, extract, and execute additional code from remote servers.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md; retrieving files via urllib.request.urlretrieve; fetching and executing code via urllib.request.urlopen",
  "sinks": "exec(base64.b64decode(...)) - executing potentially malicious code; reading remote files and executing them",
  "flows": "Remote URLs -> download files -> extract files -> fetch additional code -> decode base64 -> execute",
  "anomalies": "Multiple downloads of zip files from suspicious URLs; dynamic execution of remote code without validation; use of base64 decoding and exec on fetched data; lack of validation or checksums for downloaded content",
  "analysis": "The script begins with setting up a package using setuptools, which is standard. However, it then downloads multiple zip files from a suspicious domain, extracts them without validation, and deletes the zip files immediately after extraction. The most critical point is the final step where it fetches code from a URL, decodes it from base64, and executes it directly, which is highly suspicious and potentially malicious. This pattern indicates possible command and control behavior or malicious payload delivery, typical of malware. The use of dynamic remote code execution and multiple downloads from untrusted sources constitute significant security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior with multiple remote downloads, unvalidated extraction, and remote code execution. These actions strongly indicate malicious intent, likely for malware delivery or remote control purposes.",
