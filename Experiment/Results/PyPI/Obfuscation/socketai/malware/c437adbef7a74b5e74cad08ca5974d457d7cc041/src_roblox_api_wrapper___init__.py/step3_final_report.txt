  "purpose": "Analysis of potential malicious behavior or security risks in the Python dependency code, focusing on suspicious patterns such as dynamic execution, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or network activity.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, input functions, or code segments where data is read; potentially suspicious functions like eval(), exec(), or network connections.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, file writes, or environment variables where untrusted data could lead to data exfiltration, system compromise, or information leaks.",
  "flows": "Input sources (e.g., environment variables, user input) passing through eval()/exec() or network functions, leading to potential code execution or data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval()/exec(), obfuscated code segments, hardcoded secrets, suspicious domain names, or unusual code structures without clear purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits patterns such as dynamic execution and obfuscation, which are red flags for malicious intent. No concrete malicious payloads or system damage indicators are confirmed, but suspicion warrants a cautious malware score. Benign code lacks suspicious patterns, with no evidence of malicious activity. The scores across reports are consistent with their descriptions, with Report 2 showing moderate suspicion due to obfuscation and dynamic code patterns, and others indicating benign behavior. The confidence levels reflect the certainty based on available information, with higher confidence in benign assessments and moderate confidence in suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with no confirmed malicious activity. Report 2's suspicion of obfuscation and dynamic execution justifies a slightly elevated malware score, but no definitive malicious payloads are identified. Overall, the assessments are consistent and appropriate given the evidence.",
