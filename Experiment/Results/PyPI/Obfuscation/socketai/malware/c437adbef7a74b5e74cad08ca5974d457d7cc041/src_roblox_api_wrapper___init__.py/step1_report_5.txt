{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform a specific computational task, possibly related to data processing or utility functions, with no immediately obvious malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly present; the code does not read external input or data streams.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "There are no apparent source-to-sink data flows; the code mainly defines functions and executes simple operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscation, or unusual code patterns are detected. No backdoors or hidden behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward function definitions and basic control structures. It does not contain dynamic code execution, obfuscated segments, or suspicious external calls. The absence of network activity, file operations, or sensitive data handling indicates no malicious behaviors. The code's structure and content suggest a benign utility or algorithm implementation without any embedded malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there is no evidence of malware or malicious behavior. The code appears to be a standard, benign implementation of intended functionality with no security risks identified.",
