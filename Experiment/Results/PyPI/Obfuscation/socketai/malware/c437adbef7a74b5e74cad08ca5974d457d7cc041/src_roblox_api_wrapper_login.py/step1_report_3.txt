  "purpose": "Placeholder functions with no implementation, likely intended for credential or session handling.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'cookie', 'username', 'password' (but not used in the code).",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows, as the functions contain only 'pass' statements and no further code.",
  "flows": "No data flow as functions do not perform any operations.",
  "anomalies": "Functions are defined with obfuscated names, but contain no executable code or logic. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two empty function definitions with obfuscated names. There are no data manipulations, no input/output operations, and no malicious or suspicious logic present. The obfuscated naming could be an attempt to hide purpose, but without implementation, no malicious activity can be inferred.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal and does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a placeholder or intentionally obfuscated skeleton code with no operational logic.",
