  "purpose": "Placeholder functions possibly intended for authentication or session handling",
  "sources": "Function parameters: 'cookie', 'username', 'password'",
  "sinks": "No actual data handling, input or output operations present",
  "flows": "No data flow or processing occurs within these empty functions",
  "anomalies": "Functions are defined with obfuscated, nonsensical names; no implementation code or logic is present",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two empty functions with obfuscated names, which do not perform any operations or contain any suspicious behavior. The naming suggests an attempt to conceal purpose, but without implementation, no malicious activity or security risks are detectable. There are no data sources, sinks, or flows; the code appears to be placeholder or stub functions.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation beyond obfuscated naming. It appears to be incomplete or placeholder code with no active logic.",
