  "purpose": "Placeholder functions with obfuscated names, no implementation or logic.",
  "sources": "Function parameters (cookie, username, password), but unused.",
  "sinks": "No data flow, no untrusted data handling, no data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "None, as functions are empty and parameters are unused.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function names, parameters accepted but not used, no code logic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two empty functions with obfuscated names, no data flow, no logic, and no active behavior. The obfuscation appears superficial, mainly in naming, without any malicious payload or security vulnerabilities. Scores in reports generally reflect the inert nature, with low malware and risk scores, and high obfuscation due to naming. The functions do not perform any operations, and no suspicious activity is evident. The slight suspicion in some reports' malware scores (e.g., 0.2) is justified as cautious but not indicative of actual malicious intent. Overall, the code is benign placeholder code with superficial obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of inert, placeholder functions with obfuscated names, posing no active security threat or malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with minor adjustments to reflect the absence of any malicious activity. The obfuscation is superficial and does not imply malicious intent. Overall, the code is benign, and no further action is necessary.",
