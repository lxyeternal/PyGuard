{
  "purpose": "The functions appear to be placeholders with no implementation, likely intended for handling cookies and login credentials.",
  "sources": "No actual data sources or input reading occurs within the code; the functions accept parameters but do not process or read external data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data is processed or outputted within this code.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks since the functions contain only 'pass' statements and do not perform any operations.",
  "anomalies": "The function names are obfuscated and do not convey meaningful purpose. No code execution, data handling, or logic is present that could be malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two placeholder functions with obfuscated names and no implementation details. There are no data inputs being read, no data outputs, and no logic or operations performed. The obfuscated naming might be suspicious at first glance, but without any actual code, there is no evidence of malicious activity or security issues. The absence of any processing, network activity, or data manipulation indicates no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is minimal, consisting solely of empty function definitions with obfuscated names. There are no sources, sinks, flows, anomalies, or malicious behaviors detected. The code does not perform any operations and poses no security risk.",
