{
  "purpose": "This code appears to set up a Python package using setuptools, reading files, and defining package metadata and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading files via the 'read' function, inspecting the sys.version_info, and the embedded base64-encoded string executed conditionally for Python 2.",
  "sinks": "Executes a decoded base64 string on Python 2, potentially executing arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "Conditional check on Python version leads to execution of decoded string, which may run malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding and execution in a version check, which is often a sign of obfuscation or malicious intent. The code reads from files, but no evident harmful data handling beyond the exec.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a 'read' function for reading files and sanitizing their contents, likely for documentation. It sets up package configuration data, dependencies, and console scripts. Importantly, for Python 2, it executes a base64-decoded string which is obfuscated and potentially malicious. The decoded code appears to be an obfuscated payload, likely malicious, that is conditionally executed only on Python 2. Since Python 2 is deprecated, this is suspicious. The rest of the code appears standard for a setup script, but the conditional execution of obfuscated code is a security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains obfuscated code that executes only in Python 2 environments. This is highly suspicious and could be malicious, potentially executing arbitrary code during installation or import. The code's primary malicious aspect is the conditional 'exec' of decoded base64 content, which is a common obfuscation technique for malicious payloads.",
