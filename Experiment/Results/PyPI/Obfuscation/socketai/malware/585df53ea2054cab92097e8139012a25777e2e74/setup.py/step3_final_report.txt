  "purpose": "Detects and executes a base64-encoded payload only in Python 2 environments, likely for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "The conditional check on sys.version_info and the base64-encoded string within exec()",
  "sinks": "exec() executing decoded payload, potential arbitrary code execution",
  "flows": "sys.version_info check -> base64 decoding -> exec() of payload",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, base64 payload executed conditionally only on Python 2, use of exec() on decoded data",
  "analysis": "The code contains an obfuscated, base64-encoded payload that is executed only if the Python version is less than 3.0. The obfuscation, variable naming, and dynamic execution pattern are classic indicators of malicious intent. The payload's content is hidden, making static analysis difficult, but the pattern strongly suggests malicious activity. The use of exec() on encoded data, especially with obfuscated variables, is a high-risk indicator. The conditional execution targeting Python 2, a deprecated environment, may be an attempt to exploit legacy systems. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.75-0.9, obfuscated ~0.8-0.9, security risk ~0.75-0.8) are appropriate given these indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious intent due to obfuscation and dynamic code execution. It should be treated as malicious or highly suspicious until further payload analysis confirms safety.",
