{
  "purpose": "The code is setting up a Python package with metadata, dependencies, and entry points for installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading README or documentation files via the read() function; environment variables; sys.version_info for Python version check.",
  "sinks": "Potentially executing dynamic code via exec() with base64-decoded string; importing modules; setting up package configurations.",
  "flows": "The code reads files with regex substitution, then depending on Python version, executes dynamically decoded code which may lead to malicious behavior.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic exec() with base64-decoded string poses a high risk. The decoded code could be malicious. The variable names are obfuscated, indicating possible concealment. The code uses a hardcoded base64 string in an exec() call, which is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup procedures for a Python package, including dependency specifications and entry points. However, in the Python 2 branch, it executes dynamically decoded code from a base64 string, which is often a method used to conceal malicious payloads. The obfuscated variable names and the use of exec() with decoded data indicate malicious intent or at least a security risk. The initial part appears benign, but the conditional exec() warrants suspicion as it can run arbitrary code.",
  "conclusion": "While the initial setup code seems typical for a Python package, the conditional exec() with obfuscated, base64-encoded code in the Python 2 branch is suspicious and potentially malicious. It could execute malicious payloads hidden within the base64 string, representing a high security risk.",
