The high obfuscation warrants attention but does not indicate malicious intent based on the current analysis. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score should remain at 0 or very close to it."

There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The low malware score (0) and low security risk (approximately 0.1-0.2) are appropriate. The obfuscation score is modest (~0.3), reflecting variable naming but not malicious obfuscation."

The high obfuscation score reflects naming obfuscation but does not imply malicious intent. Overall, the code is safe, serving as a utility for data processing and output."

Despite the obfuscation, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The high obfuscation score reflects the naming complexity, but the overall risk remains low. The supply chain dependency appears safe and functional."

The obfuscation is superficial and does not imply malicious obfuscation techniques. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to potential downstream misuse of operator inversion, but in isolation, it is safe."

The low malware score (0.2) and low security risk (0.3) are appropriate, with high obfuscation (0.75) reflecting the code's obscured nature. Further dynamic analysis is recommended if runtime behavior changes or additional context is available."
