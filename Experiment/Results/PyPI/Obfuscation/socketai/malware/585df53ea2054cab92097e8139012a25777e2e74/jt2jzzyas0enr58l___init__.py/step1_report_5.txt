  "purpose": "Define package version and author information, and set exported symbols",
  "sources": "Assignment of version string, author string, and __all__ list",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or external communication",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; simple assignments",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious functions, no obfuscated code, no external data fetching or execution",
  "analysis": "The code assigns static strings to variables representing package version and author information. It also initializes an empty list for __all__. There are no dynamic or external data inputs, no network calls, no cryptic code, and no user inputs. The email appears to be a string assignment and not used maliciously in this fragment. Overall, the code appears benign and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple static assignment of version and author info with no suspicious behavior or malicious intent detected.",
