  "purpose": "Static metadata assignment of version and author info, with an empty export list.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version string and author string containing an email address.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "N/A; static assignments only.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of an email address with a potentially suspicious domain; obfuscated variable names but no dynamic or external code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments defining version and author info. The email address is hardcoded and static, with no external data sources or dynamic code execution. Variable names are obfuscated but do not execute or manipulate data. No functions, external calls, or malicious code are present. The email address could be privacy-sensitive but does not indicate malicious intent. The code is benign and primarily metadata.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign static metadata with obfuscated variable names and a potentially privacy-sensitive email address. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The low malware score (0) and low security risk (approximately 0.1-0.2) are appropriate. The obfuscation score is modest (~0.3), reflecting variable naming but not malicious obfuscation.",
