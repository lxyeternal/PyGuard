  "purpose": "Define package version and author contact information, and declare exportable symbols",
  "sources": "Assignment statements for version and author email",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or external interactions",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only assigns static strings",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variable names and a non-descriptive author email address, which could be suspicious if used maliciously, but nothing concrete here",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string and an author email to variables with obfuscated names. The email appears to be a personal contact, and there are no input or data read operations, no external calls, and no sensitive operations. The __all__ list is empty, indicating no explicit exports. Overall, the code is straightforward and appears to serve as metadata. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detectable.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple metadata with obfuscated variable names and no malicious intent or security risk evident. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security issues.",
