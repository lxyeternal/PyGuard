  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated data parsing utility with no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. The high obfuscation warrants attention but does not indicate malicious intent based on the current analysis. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score should remain at 0 or very close to it."
