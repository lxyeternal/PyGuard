  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated but legitimate linear programming or optimization routine. Despite the obfuscation, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The high obfuscation score reflects the naming complexity, but the overall risk remains low. The supply chain dependency appears safe and functional."
