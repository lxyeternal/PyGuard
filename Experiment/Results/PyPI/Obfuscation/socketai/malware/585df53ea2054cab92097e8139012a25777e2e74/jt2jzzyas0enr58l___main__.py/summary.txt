  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate LP solver front-end with high obfuscation. No evidence of malicious activity or supply chain sabotage is detected from static analysis. The low malware score (0.2) and low security risk (0.3) are appropriate, with high obfuscation (0.75) reflecting the code's obscured nature. Further dynamic analysis is recommended if runtime behavior changes or additional context is available."
