{
  "purpose": "The function appears to process input data by transforming comparison operators and filtering data based on a mode ('max' or 'min'), then returning several processed data structures along with some input parameters.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: HiSCIqlxZolfrwIqDMCrcsAMMiiEnaoq, jDPHogvJBNpFJthExgVZxdxwcwfmQSuz, OvyZaJAuaqlUMLKlthmBEWUPlAStVljc, UUUVUkyTuQujZuOlqmhXhzuRLUcZMoau, uTkHaocYQnzbsOJMXfhbrMHuLMuXzATB, dEjaUOydQMcjTHdsjqjvuEmlNcZTXhGS",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no data is written to external systems, files, or network connections",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed and transformed within the function; no external flows are evident",
  "anomalies": "The code performs operator inversion based on a mode ('max' or 'min'), which is a typical data transformation; no suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors identified",
  "analysis": "The function processes list inputs, replacing comparison operators ('>', '<', '=') with their inverses if the mode is 'max', otherwise keeps them unchanged. It then returns a tuple of processed data and some of the input parameters. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious operations are present. There is no indication of malicious behavior or data exfiltration. The code appears to be a utility function for data manipulation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function that performs comparison operator inversion and data processing based on mode. It does not contain malware, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious flows. Overall, it is a safe and straightforward implementation.",
