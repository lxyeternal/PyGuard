  "purpose": "The function processes input lists and performs conditional value transformations, likely for data manipulation or comparison purposes.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: HiSCIqlxZolfrwIqDMCrcsAMMiiEnaoq, jDPHogvJBNpFJthExgVZxdxwcwfmQSuz, OvyZaJAuaqlUMLKlthmBEWUPlAStVljc, UUUVUkyTuQujZuOlqmhXhzuRLUcZMoau, uTkHaocYQnzbsOJMXfhbrMHuLMuXzATB, dEjaUOydQMcjTHdsjqjvuEmlNcZTXhGS.",
  "sinks": "Return statement outputs: modified lists and parameters; no direct data leaks or external network communication.",
  "flows": "Transforms elements in provided lists based on conditional checks and outputs modified versions; no external or untrusted data flows outside the function.",
  "anomalies": "The function includes redundant conditional logic, specifically the re-mapping of comparison operators; variable names are obfuscated, providing low clarity but no clear malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code performs list transformations based on comparison operators and a mode parameter ('max' or 'min'). It swaps '>' and '<' symbols conditionally and returns processed lists along with some input parameters. No evidence of data leakage, external network activity, or malicious payloads is observed. The obfuscated variable names and somewhat redundant logic suggest an attempt to obscure intent, but the core operations are benign data manipulations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a data transformation function with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. Its obfuscation is superficial and does not indicate malicious intent. It does not perform any external communications, credential handling, or other suspicious activities.",
