  "purpose": "The function processes input lists, transforming comparison operators based on a mode ('max' or 'min') and returning modified data along with some input parameters.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: HiSCIqlxZolfrwIqDMCrcsAMMiiEnaoq, jDPHogvJBNpFJthExgVZxdxwcwfmQSuz, OvyZaJAuaqlUMLKlthmBEWUPlAStVljc, UUUVUkyTuQujZuOlqmhXhzuRLUcZMoau, uTkHaocYQnzbsOJMXfhbrMHuLMuXzATB, dEjaUOydQMcjTHdsjqjvuEmlNcZTXhGS.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly, but the function manipulates comparison operators, which could be used in larger context to influence logic flow.",
  "flows": "Input data is processed through conditional checks and operator substitutions, then returned alongside other parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The function replaces comparison operators based on mode; this behavior could be part of a logic obfuscation or manipulation, but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that takes multiple input lists and strings, then creates transformed versions of these lists depending on the mode ('max' or other). It swaps comparison operators within a list based on the mode, which could be used to alter logical conditions downstream. The function also returns a subset of inputs and a derived string indicating 'max' or 'min'. There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, network activity, or other malicious behaviors. The operator swapping could be suspicious if used maliciously to manipulate logic, but in isolation, it appears as a benign data transformation.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs conditional data transformations, particularly on comparison operators, but does not contain any direct malicious activity or malware. It is a benign utility function that could be used for logical manipulations. No evidence of malicious behavior or security risks was found.",
