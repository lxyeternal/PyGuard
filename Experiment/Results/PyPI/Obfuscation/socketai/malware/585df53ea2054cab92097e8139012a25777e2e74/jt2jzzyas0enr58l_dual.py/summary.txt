  "conclusion": "The function is a benign utility for data transformation involving comparison operators. No malware or malicious behavior is detected. The obfuscation is superficial and does not imply malicious obfuscation techniques. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to potential downstream misuse of operator inversion, but in isolation, it is safe."
