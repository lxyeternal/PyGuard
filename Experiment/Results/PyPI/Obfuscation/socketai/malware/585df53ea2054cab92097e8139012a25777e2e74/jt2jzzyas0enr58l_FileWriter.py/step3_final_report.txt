  "purpose": "Data formatting and output utility for processing lists, numpy arrays, and strings, with options to print or save to file.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as lists, numpy arrays, strings, and file paths.",
  "sinks": "Console output via print or writing formatted data to specified files.",
  "flows": "Input data is processed through formatting functions, then either printed or written to files depending on parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with nonsensical class and method names; no malicious payloads or external communications detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs data formatting tasks: concatenating list elements with delimiters, processing numpy array elements, and combining strings. It outputs results to console or files. No network calls, code injection, or system modifications are present. Obfuscation appears superficial, aimed at hiding purpose but not malicious activity. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are identified. The functions are straightforward, and the data flow is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign data formatting utility with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The high obfuscation score reflects naming obfuscation but does not imply malicious intent. Overall, the code is safe, serving as a utility for data processing and output.",
