{
  "purpose": "The script defines a setup configuration for a Python package with obfuscated variable names, and includes a custom installation command that executes remote code on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "Remote code execution is triggered via Fernet-decrypted payload within the custom install command. The Fernet key and encrypted data are hardcoded.",
  "sinks": "The Fernet decrypt method outputs code which is then executed via exec(), potentially running malicious code from the decrypted payload.",
  "flows": "During installation on Windows, the code decrypts data with Fernet, then executes it, leading to remote code execution. This flow introduces a malicious code sink during setup.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; use of encrypted payloads; dynamic execution via exec() of decrypted data; code performs remote requests and decrypts data during install; minimal comments and suspicious string patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code employs obfuscation and encrypted payloads to mask its behavior. It hooks into the setup process, specifically in a custom install class, and runs remote code via Fernet decryption and exec(). The decrypted code is not visible, but this pattern is indicative of malicious intent, such as installing backdoors or performing malicious actions during package installation. The use of requests and Fernet, along with the encrypted payload, suggests an attempt to execute hidden malicious code on Windows systems during package setup. The rest of the code appears benign, but the core behavior is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains malicious behavior by executing remote-decrypted code during installation on Windows, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent. The obfuscation and encrypted payload are typical indicators of malicious supply chain tactics.",
