  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity, primarily due to the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during setup. The behavior aligns with common malware tactics such as stealth, obfuscation, and conditional payload execution. The assigned scores are justified and indicate a high security risk, warranting further investigation or avoidance of this package."
