  "anomalies": [
    "renaming downloaded files to system-like paths to disguise their presence",
    "downloading and executing files from URLs hosted on Discord, which is uncommon for legitimate software",
    "creating a directory in a system directory (C:\\$Windows.~SXK) and cleaning it up afterward",
    "install_requires includes 'hack', a suspicious keyword in setup configuration"
  ],
  "analysis": "The script sets up a Python package with a suspicious keyword 'hack' and attempts to install 'requests' and 'subprocess' modules if missing. It creates a hidden directory in a system-like path and downloads two executable files from external URLs. These files are renamed to mimic system files and are executed immediately, which suggests malware activity such as remote code execution or persistence mechanisms. The use of Discord URLs and renaming files to system-like paths indicates potential malicious intent. The script also cleans up temporary files, likely to evade detection. The overall behavior strongly indicates malicious activity designed to infect or compromise the host system.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits clear signs of malicious behavior, including downloading and executing remote executables, disguising files as system components, and cleaning up traces. It likely functions as malware intended to compromise the host system, making it highly dangerous to run or include in any package.",
