{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed to download and execute potentially malicious files from external sources, possibly for unauthorized or harmful activities.",
  "sources": "Input sources include URL requests for external executable files ('https://cdn.discordapp.com/.../ZYXMN.exe' and 'ZYRBX.exe'), and local file system operations such as file deletions and directory creation.",
  "sinks": "Execution of downloaded files via os.startfile, writing to specific system directories, and removal of files/directories indicate potential malicious payload execution and persistence mechanisms.",
  "flows": "The code downloads executables from remote URLs (sources) and saves them in a specific directory, then executes these files, which could lead to malicious actions on the host system.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses obfuscated variable names, downloads files from suspicious Discord CDN URLs, forcibly renames and executes them, and creates a directory in a system path typically used to hide malicious payloads. Also, it installs 'requests' and 'subprocess' modules dynamically if missing, which is common in malicious scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by setting up package metadata with misleading keywords ('hack') and attempts to install dependencies 'requests' and 'subprocess'. It creates a directory in a system path and then downloads two executable files from Discord CDN URLs. These files are renamed and executed without user consent, which is typical of malware distribution. The script also removes these files and the created directory afterward, possibly to hide traces. The overall behavior—downloading, renaming, executing, and cleaning up—strongly suggests malicious intent, aiming to run unauthorized code on the host system.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits clear signs of malicious activity, including downloading and executing remote payloads, obfuscated variable names, and use of system paths to hide files. It appears designed to infect or control the host system covertly, indicating high malicious intent and security risk.",
