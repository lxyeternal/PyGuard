{
  "purpose": "The code downloads two executables from Discord CDN URLs, saves them into a system-like directory, renames them to mimic Windows system files, executes them, and then deletes the files and directory. It obfuscates variable names and suppresses errors, indicating malicious intent to deliver and execute remote payloads while hiding traces.",
  "sources": "Requests to remote URLs for executables, reading URLs, and file operations (write, rename, delete).",
  "sinks": "Execution of downloaded files via os.startfile(), writing files to system-like directories, and deleting files/directories.",
  "flows": "Requests.get() retrieves remote executables -> files are written to disk -> files are renamed to mimic system files -> os.startfile() executes these files -> files and directory are deleted.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, use of Discord CDN for payload hosting, renaming files to system-like filenames, silent exception handling, and mimicking Windows system directories and files.",
  "analysis": "The code downloads malicious executables from untrusted sources, disguises them as system files, executes them without user consent, and cleans up traces. Variable obfuscation and silent error handling further conceal malicious activity. The behavior aligns with typical malware delivery scripts, aiming to infect or control the host system. The code's actions are consistent with malicious intent, with no legitimate benign purpose evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior, including remote payload download, execution, obfuscation, and trace hiding. The high risk and malware scores are justified. It should be flagged as malicious and removed from any package. The overall assessment indicates a high probability of malicious activity.",
