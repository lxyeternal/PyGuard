{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package, but its primary function is to download and execute potentially malicious executable files from remote URLs, then clean up and delete local copies.",
  "sources": "Requests module for HTTP GET requests, file system functions for writing files, and the URLs which host executables.",
  "sinks": "Execution of downloaded files via os.startfile, removal of files, and creation of directories in system paths.",
  "flows": "HTTP GET requests retrieve executables, files are written to disk, then executed with os.startfile, followed by cleanup operations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of random and obfuscated variable names, downloading executables from suspicious URLs on Discord CDN, saving files in a system directory with disguised filenames, and executing them without user consent. The code also attempts to silently install dependencies, which may be unnecessary for benign purposes.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by setting up package dependencies with obfuscated code and unusual variable names. It then creates a hidden or disguised directory in a Windows system path. It downloads two executables from external URLs hosted on Discord CDN, saves them with seemingly random filenames in the target directory, and then executes them via os.startfile. It proceeds to delete the downloaded files and remove the directory. The use of obfuscated variable names, the download from external sources, and silent execution strongly indicate malicious intent, likely for payload delivery or malware infection.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading, executing, and cleaning up potentially harmful executable files from external URLs. It is highly suspicious and indicates an attempt to perform unauthorized or harmful actions on the host system.",
