  "purpose": "Basic arithmetic functions performing addition and subtraction, with one function having an obfuscated name.",
  "sources": "Function definitions; no external data input or output operations.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are directly used in arithmetic operations; no external data flows or external calls.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function name; no other unusual code patterns or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two straightforward arithmetic functions, one with an obfuscated name. No external dependencies, side effects, or malicious patterns are present. The obfuscated name is noted but does not indicate malicious intent. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions suggest benign behavior. Scores reflect high confidence in benign nature, with minor suspicion due to obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing simple arithmetic with an obfuscated function name. No malicious activity or security risks are detected. The obfuscation is minor and does not imply malicious intent.",
