  "flows": "Input parameters -> operation -> return value",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code patterns, no obfuscated elements, and no external data sources or sinks present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions: 'add' for addition and 'JKlrCNSSLgJXOseeRfCtcKpsLXKCBpUF' for subtraction. Both functions accept two parameters and perform straightforward arithmetic operations. The function names are non-descriptive, which could be considered obfuscation, but they do not perform any malicious activity. There are no data leaks, external communications, or suspicious code patterns identified. The structure is simple and standard, with no signs of malicious intent or malware behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign, performing basic arithmetic operations with no malicious behavior detected. The unusual function name is likely obfuscation, but it does not affect security. Overall, the code poses no security threats.",
