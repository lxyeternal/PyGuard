  "purpose": "Basic arithmetic operations: addition and subtraction",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'one' and 'two' in both functions",
  "sinks": "No external data sources or outputs; no external network or file interactions",
  "flows": "Input parameters directly used in return statements, straightforward data flow",
  "anomalies": "Function name 'JKlrCNSSLgJXOseeRfCtcKpsLXKCBpUF' is obfuscated, but the code itself performs simple arithmetic without malicious intent",
  "analysis": "The code contains two functions: 'add' and an obfuscated-named function performing subtraction. Both perform basic arithmetic operations on their inputs. No suspicious code patterns, no external data handling, no malicious behaviors identified. The obfuscated function name could be a concern, but its implementation is benign. No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious network activity, or malicious logic present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and performs basic arithmetic operations with no evidence of malicious behavior. The obfuscated function name appears to be a placeholder or an attempt to hide intent, but the logic is benign. Overall, no security risks detected.",
