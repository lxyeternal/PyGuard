  "purpose": "Simple arithmetic functions for addition and subtraction",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'one' and 'two'",
  "sinks": "None observed; no data output or external interaction",
  "flows": "Parameters 'one' and 'two' flow into addition or subtraction operations",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a function with an obfuscated or non-descriptive name 'JKlrCNSSLgJXOseeRfCtcKpsLXKCBpUF', no comments, and no external calls or side effects",
  "analysis": "The code contains two straightforward arithmetic functions: one adds two inputs, the other subtracts them. The second function has an obfuscated name, which could indicate an attempt to hide its purpose. However, both functions perform basic operations with no external dependencies, no data leakage, no input/output beyond return values, and no signs of malicious behavior. There are no hardcoded credentials, network calls, or suspicious code structures.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple, benign, and performs basic arithmetic without any malicious intent or security risks. The presence of an obfuscated function name is not inherently malicious but may warrant further context review if part of a larger codebase.",
