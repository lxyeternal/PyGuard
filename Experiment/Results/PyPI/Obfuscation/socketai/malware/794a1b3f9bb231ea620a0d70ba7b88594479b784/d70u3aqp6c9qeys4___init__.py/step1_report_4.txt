{
  "purpose": "The code defines two simple arithmetic functions: addition and subtraction.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No output or untrusted data handling points; functions return computed values.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are directly used in return statements without any external data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "The second function has an obfuscated name, which is unusual but not inherently malicious; no other anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The code contains two straightforward arithmetic functions. The first function 'add' performs addition, and the second 'JKlrCNSSLgJXOseeRfCtcKpsLXKCBpUF' performs subtraction. The second function's name appears obfuscated or randomly generated, which might suggest hiding intent, but the function itself only performs a basic arithmetic operation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious data handling. No external input, network calls, or sensitive data manipulations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of simple arithmetic functions with an obfuscated name for one function. No malicious or security-threatening behavior is detected.",
