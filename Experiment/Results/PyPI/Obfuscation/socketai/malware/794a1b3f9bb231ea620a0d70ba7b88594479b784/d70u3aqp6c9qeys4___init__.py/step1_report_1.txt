{
  "purpose": "The code provides basic arithmetic functions for addition and subtraction.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'one' and 'two' in the functions add() and JKlrCNSSLgJXOseeRfCtcKpsLXKCBpUF().",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the functions return results directly without side effects or external interactions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into the functions, which perform arithmetic operations and return the results.",
  "anomalies": "The function name 'JKlrCNSSLgJXOseeRfCtcKpsLXKCBpUF' appears obfuscated and does not describe its purpose. No other anomalies or malicious code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two simple arithmetic functions with one clearly named 'add' and another with an obfuscated name performing subtraction. The obfuscated function name may indicate an attempt to conceal purpose, but the function itself performs basic arithmetic without external side effects. No suspicious or malicious behaviors, such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors, are present. The code appears to be benign, possibly part of a larger, straightforward calculation module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple arithmetic functions with one function name obfuscated. No malicious behavior detected, and no security risks are apparent. The obfuscated function name alone does not imply malicious intent.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0.6,
