    "function sRlYyZuDweeJdFedIhembDftOnGgJlAP() executes system commands that collect sensitive info"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that constructs a shell command with embedded system information collection commands, which are then executed via subprocess.run with shell=True. The command attempts to collect hostname, user info, password files, npm modules, bash history, and other sensitive data, and send it to an external server. The presence of this command indicates malicious intent related to data exfiltration. The initial requests.get call fetches a webpage but does not impact other operations. The setup function is standard and unrelated to malicious activity. Overall, the main concern is the embedded shell command designed for system information theft and external transmission.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains malicious behavior aimed at collecting and exfiltrating sensitive system information through crafted shell commands. It also uses requests to connect to an external website, but the primary malicious activity is the data exfiltration command. The package itself does not appear to contain obfuscation, but the purpose of the shell command indicates high malicious intent.",
