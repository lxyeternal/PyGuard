{
  "purpose": "A simple Python function that increments a number by 1.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code imports 'os' but does not use it.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; the code performs a basic calculation only.",
  "flows": "Input parameter 'number' flows directly into the addition operation; no external data flows or external calls.",
  "anomalies": "Unused import of 'os'; obfuscated function name; minimal code with no external interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function with an obfuscated name that adds 1 to its input. The 'os' module is imported but not used, which is suspicious but not malicious. The function performs a benign operation. The obfuscated name and unused import are red flags for concealment but do not indicate malicious intent in isolation. No external data flows, sinks, or malicious behaviors are present. The code's simplicity suggests benign intent, but the obfuscation warrants cautious suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or security issues. The obfuscation and unused import are minor red flags but do not constitute malicious behavior. The scores should reflect a very low malware risk, moderate suspicion due to obfuscation, and minimal security risk.",
