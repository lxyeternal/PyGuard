{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a simple function that increments its input by 2.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'os' module and an internal module 'add'.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that handle untrusted data or cause data leaks.",
  "flows": "The function 'tZCctiJtihtVddPmXjTelGiNLNJjSQxI' takes an input and returns input + 2; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "The function name is obfuscated and nonsensical; importing 'os' without using it suggests possible intent to hide malicious activity. No code execution or malicious actions are present in the snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard library 'os' and a local module 'add' but does not use them. The function is straightforward and harmless, simply adding 2 to its input. The obfuscated function name might be an attempt to hide malicious intent, but there is no evidence of malicious behavior within this snippet. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. The code is minimal and benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is harmless and appears to be a simple utility function with obfuscated naming. No malicious activity or security risks are evident from this fragment.",
