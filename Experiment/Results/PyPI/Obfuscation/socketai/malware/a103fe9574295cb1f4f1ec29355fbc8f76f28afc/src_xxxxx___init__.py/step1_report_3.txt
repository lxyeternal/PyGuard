{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a simple utility function that adds 2 to its input.",
  "sources": "Reads from the parameter x; imports from the local module add",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating untrusted data handling or external data leaks",
  "flows": "Input x flows directly into the return statement with addition operation",
  "anomalies": "Presence of an import statement from a local module 'add' which could be benign or suspicious; function name is obfuscated, which may indicate an attempt to hide intent, but no malicious activity is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a local module, which is common in Python projects. The function tZCctiJtihtVddPmXjTelGiNLNJjSQxI adds 2 to its argument, with no further processing. The obfuscated function name and the import could be harmless, but they can also be used to hide malicious intent. No data leakage, external network activity, or malicious payloads are present. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit any signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply defines a basic addition function with a somewhat obfuscated name. The import statement does not introduce any immediate concern without additional context.",
