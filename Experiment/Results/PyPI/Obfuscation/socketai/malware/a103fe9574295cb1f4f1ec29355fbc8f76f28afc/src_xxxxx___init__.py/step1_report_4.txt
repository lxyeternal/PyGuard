{
  "purpose": "The code defines a simple function that adds 2 to its input and imports a module named 'add'.",
  "sources": "Reading from the imported module 'add' and the input parameter 'x'.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks are present; the function returns a value but does not interact with external systems or untrusted data sources.",
  "flows": "Input parameter 'x' is processed and returned after adding 2; the imported module 'add' is imported but not used in the visible code.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual filename for the function name (tZCctiJtihtVddPmXjTelGiNLNJjSQxI) suggests obfuscation or autogenerated code; the imported module 'add' is not used, which could be suspicious if 'add' has malicious behavior, but this cannot be determined from this fragment alone.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple addition operation with a parameter and imports a module without using it. The function name appears obfuscated, which is often a sign of hiding intent, but no malicious or maliciously suspicious behavior is explicitly present in this fragment. There are no obvious security issues such as code injection or data leaks. The import statement is not used, which could indicate incomplete code or a potential attempt to hide malicious imports elsewhere.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears benign and simple, with no direct evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The obfuscated function name and unused import could be benign or malicious depending on the larger context, but nothing in this snippet indicates malicious behavior.",
