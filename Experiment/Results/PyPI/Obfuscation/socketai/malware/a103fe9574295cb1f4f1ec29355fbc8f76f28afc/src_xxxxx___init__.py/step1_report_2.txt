{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a simple function that adds 2 to its input, with an import statement that references a local module.",
  "sources": "The function parameter 'x' is a source of input data.",
  "sinks": "The function's return output could be considered a sink if the returned value is used insecurely elsewhere, but within this code, no direct sink is present.",
  "flows": "Input 'x' flows into the function and is processed to produce 'x + 2'. There are no other data flows or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "The import statement 'from . import add' suggests potential use of a local module, but it is not used within this snippet. The function name 'tZCctiJtihtVddPmXjTelGiNLNJjSQxI' appears obfuscated or auto-generated, which can be suspicious but does not indicate malicious intent by itself.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a local module 'add' but does not utilize it, which may suggest incomplete or obfuscated code. The function itself performs a simple addition, with no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection. The obfuscated function name could indicate an attempt to hide intent, but with the provided snippet, no malicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is very simple and appears benign. The obfuscated function name and unused import are suspicious but not malicious in isolation. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified based on this code snippet.",
