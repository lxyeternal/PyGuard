  "purpose": "Defines a simple function that adds 2 to its input, with unused imports and an obfuscated name.",
  "sources": "Parameter 'x'; imports 'os' and local module 'add' (unused).",
  "sinks": "None.",
  "flows": "Input 'x' flows directly to output after addition.",
  "anomalies": "Unused imports; obfuscated function name; no external input/output handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, with no network activity, data leaks, or malicious payloads. The obfuscated name and unused imports suggest superficial obfuscation or placeholder code, but no malicious intent is evident. The function performs a straightforward addition, and no external data is processed or transmitted.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with minor obfuscation and unused imports that do not indicate malicious behavior. No evidence of malware or security risks is present.",
