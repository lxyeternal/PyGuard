{
  "purpose": "The purpose appears to be a simple function that adds 2 to a given input, likely for mathematical or processing use within a larger program.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input directly. It imports the 'os' module but does not use it. It also imports a local module 'add', but does not utilize it within this snippet.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or leaked.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks, as the code does not handle external inputs or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains an import statement for 'os' and a local module 'add' that are not used, which might suggest incomplete code or obfuscation, but nothing inherently suspicious. The function name is nonsensical and could indicate obfuscation or generated code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules without using them, which is suspicious but not malicious in itself. The function simply adds 2 to its argument, with no input validation or external interaction. No data leaks, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are present. The unused imports and nonsensical function name could suggest obfuscation or placeholder code, but there's no evidence of malicious intent or malicious code segments.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears benign, performing a straightforward addition operation with no malicious behavior. The unused imports and obscure function name are minor anomalies but do not indicate malware or security risks.",
