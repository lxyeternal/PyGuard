  "conclusion": "Most code snippets are benign with low security risks, except report 5 which shows obfuscation and dynamic execution, justifying higher suspicion. The current scores are appropriate; a slight increase in malware score for report 4 to 0.3 is recommended to better reflect potential misuse. No major revisions needed."
