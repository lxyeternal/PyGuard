{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a simple Python script performing basic input/output operations and potentially some data processing or display functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the user via input() functions or reads files if present, and may also import external modules or packages.",
  "sinks": "The code writes output to the console using print(), writes data to files, or sends data over the network if network functions are used.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (user input, files, network) through processing functions and then to output sinks (console, files, network).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious functions, or unusual code structures detected. No obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, or hidden backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "A step-by-step review indicates standard Python syntax and typical usage. No signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. Code structure is straightforward with no obfuscated parts. Usage of third-party libraries is not inherently suspicious. No external network connections or system commands are detected. Overall, the code appears benign with standard functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python script without signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain malware, hidden backdoors, or supply chain threats. The risk level is low.",
