{
  "purpose": "To evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Code reading from environment variables, files, network inputs, and data processing functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks through network transmission, file writing, environment variable access, or logging.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or network inputs flow into processing functions, with potential sinks being network transmission, file system, or logs.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious constructs like dynamic execution, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns; no definitive malicious activity observed.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate low or no malicious activity, with scores reflecting confidence levels and suspicion. Report 5 notes obfuscation but no malware, which is consistent. The scores align with the described code behaviors. No significant inconsistencies are found; the cautious scores for obfuscation and risk in Report 5 are justified given the suspicious constructs, but malware remains at zero across all reports.",
  "conclusion": "The provided assessments and scores are consistent and appropriate. No adjustments are necessary; the code appears benign with some suspicion in obfuscation but no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.2,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.2,
