  "conclusion": "The package contains malicious code that executes a remote script during installation, representing a high-severity supply chain attack vector. The obfuscation via base64 is intended to hide this malicious activity. The behavior is consistent with malicious intent, and the scores assigned in the reports (malware: 1, obfuscated: 0.8, security risk: 1) are justified and accurate."
