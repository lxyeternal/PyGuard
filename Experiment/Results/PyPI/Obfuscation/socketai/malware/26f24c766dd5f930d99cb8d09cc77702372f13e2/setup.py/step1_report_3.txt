{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up a Python package with custom install and develop commands, and includes a function that decodes base64-encoded code and executes it during installation.",
  "sources": "The base64-encoded string within the notmalfunc() function, which is decoded and executed during the install process.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the decoded base64 string via os.system, which could run arbitrary system commands.",
  "flows": "The base64 string is decoded in b64d(), then passed to os.system in notmalfunc(), which is called during the install process in AfterInstall.run().",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding to obfuscate code, dynamic execution of code via os.system with decoded content, and execution during package installation indicate potential malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a base64 decoding function and uses it to decode a string that is executed with os.system during the package's installation phase. The base64 string translates to a curl command that fetches a resource from a suspicious IP address and outputs it to a file named 'test.txt'. This behavior is indicative of malicious activity, such as retrieving potentially harmful payloads or exfiltrating data. The use of obfuscation (base64) and execution during setup raises strong suspicion of malicious intent. No legitimate package setup code requires such obfuscated command execution during installation.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains malicious behavior: during installation, it executes a base64-encoded command that fetches data from an external server, which is a common tactic in supply chain attacks. The use of obfuscation and remote code execution indicates high malicious potential.",
