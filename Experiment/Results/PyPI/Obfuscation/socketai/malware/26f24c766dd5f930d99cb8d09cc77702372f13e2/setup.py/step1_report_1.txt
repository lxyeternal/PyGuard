{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to set up a Python package, but it contains hidden malicious behavior that executes encoded code during installation.",
  "sources": "The base64-encoded string within the notmalfunc() function, which is decoded and executed via os.system.",
  "sinks": "The decoded code is executed via os.system, which can run arbitrary system commands.",
  "flows": "The base64 string is decoded in notmalfunc(), then passed to os.system, leading to execution of arbitrary code during package installation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding and execution of decoded string in os.system during install phase; obfuscated code pattern; function name 'notmalfunc' is misleading.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools for package setup, then defines a function b64d() to decode base64-encoded strings. The function notmalfunc() decodes a base64 string that, when decoded, executes a curl command to a remote server, likely for malicious purposes. The notmalfunc() is called during the 'install' command via the AfterInstall class, which extends setuptools' install class. This means that during package installation, the code will execute a remote command, which is highly suspicious. The code employs obfuscation by encoding a command in base64, and the execution during setup indicates malicious intent aimed at executing arbitrary system commands during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains malicious behavior by executing decoded remote code during installation, which could lead to remote command execution or system compromise. The obfuscation and execution during setup are clear indicators of malicious intent.",
