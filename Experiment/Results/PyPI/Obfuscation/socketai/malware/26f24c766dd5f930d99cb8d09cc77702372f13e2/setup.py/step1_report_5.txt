{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up a Python package, but it includes a function that decodes base64-encoded code and executes it during installation, which can be malicious.",
  "sources": "The base64-encoded string in the 'notmalfunc' function, executed via os.system().",
  "sinks": "Execution of decoded code through os.system(), which runs system commands possibly derived from untrusted or encoded sources.",
  "flows": "b64d() decodes the base64 string; the decoded string is passed to os.system(), executing the command in the shell.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding to conceal code; execution of decoded code via os.system() during installation; the code indicates obfuscation intended to hide malicious payload.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools and defines functions for decoding base64 strings. The 'notmalfunc' function decodes a base64-encoded shell command and executes it using os.system(). This command appears to perform an HTTP request to an external IP address, which may be suspicious or malicious. The 'run' methods of custom install and develop classes invoke the potentially malicious 'notmalfunc' during package installation or development setup. The package metadata indicates it is a test package but the code behavior suggests malicious intent through concealed code execution at install time.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated behavior designed to execute a remote command during installation, indicating malicious intent. The use of base64 decoding and execution via os.system is suspicious and could compromise systems where this package is installed.",
