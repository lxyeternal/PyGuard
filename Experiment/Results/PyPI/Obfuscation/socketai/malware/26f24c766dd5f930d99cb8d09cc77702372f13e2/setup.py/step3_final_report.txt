{
  "purpose": "The source code is designed to execute a remote command during package installation by decoding a base64-encoded string and running it via os.system. The command fetches and executes a script from a remote server, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The base64-encoded string decoded in notmalfunc(), which is invoked during the install process; specifically, the string is decoded and passed to os.system for execution.",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing the decoded command, which fetches and runs a remote script via curl and bash.",
  "flows": "The base64 string is decoded in b64d(), then passed to os.system in notmalfunc(), which is invoked during the install phase via AfterInstall.run(), creating a source-to-sink flow from the encoded payload to remote code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding to obfuscate a remote fetch-and-execute command; execution of remote code during package installation; misleading function name 'notmalfunc()'; no validation or sandboxing of the fetched script.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup process that, during installation, decodes a base64 string which contains a command to silently fetch a script from a remote server and execute it with bash. This occurs in the AfterInstall class, which runs during setup, meaning malicious code executes automatically upon package installation. The use of base64 encoding is a common obfuscation tactic. The command points to an external IP, indicating potential remote control or malware deployment. The code's structure and behavior align with known supply chain attack patterns, executing remote code during package setup, which poses a severe security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains malicious code that executes a remote script during installation, representing a high-severity supply chain attack vector. The obfuscation via base64 is intended to hide this malicious activity. The behavior is consistent with malicious intent, and the scores assigned in the reports (malware: 1, obfuscated: 0.8, security risk: 1) are justified and accurate.",
