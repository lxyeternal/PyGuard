  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, but it includes malicious behavior that exfiltrates system hostname and IP address information.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), socket.gethostbyname()",
  "sinks": "Webhook.send() via Discord webhook",
  "flows": "hostname and IP address are collected from socket functions and sent via Discord webhook",
  "anomalies": "Use of a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, obfuscated class and variable names, sending system info to an external server",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom install command class that, during installation, retrieves the system hostname and IP address using socket functions. It then uses a Discord webhook to send this system information, which indicates data exfiltration. The webhook URL is hardcoded, and the class and variable names are obfuscated, suggesting malicious intent. The setup function registers this custom class, meaning this behavior executes when the package is installed. The presence of a Discord webhook for system info exfiltration and obfuscated identifiers are suspicious, pointing to malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains malicious behavior by exfiltrating system hostname and IP address data during installation through a Discord webhook, indicating a supply chain attack vector. The obfuscation and hardcoded webhook strongly suggest malicious intent.",
