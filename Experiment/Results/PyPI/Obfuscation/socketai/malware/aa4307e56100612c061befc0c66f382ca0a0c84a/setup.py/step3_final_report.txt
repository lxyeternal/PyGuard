  "purpose": "The code exfiltrates system hostname and IP address via a Discord webhook during package installation, indicating malicious intent to perform unauthorized data collection.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), socket.gethostbyname()",

  "flows": "system info (hostname, IP) -> webhook send during install",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded webhook URL, obfuscated class and method names, data exfiltration during setup",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that overrides a method to collect system hostname and IP, then sends this data to a hardcoded Discord webhook during package installation. The class and method names are obfuscated, and the webhook URL is embedded directly in the code, indicating malicious intent. The behavior occurs automatically during setup, which is unusual for legitimate packages. The code's purpose is clearly to exfiltrate system information without user consent, constituting a supply chain attack vector. The obfuscation and hardcoded URL further support malicious intent. The behavior is active, deliberate, and poses a severe security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs active data exfiltration during package installation, indicating high malicious intent. The obfuscation and embedded webhook URL reinforce this assessment. The scores assigned in the reports—malware: 1.0, obfuscated: 0.8, security risk: 1.0—are justified and consistent with the evidence. This package should be flagged as malicious and removed from distribution channels.",
