{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, with an embedded custom install command that executes additional code during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the hostname and IP address via socket.gethostname() and socket.gethostbyname(). It also references a Discord webhook URL hardcoded in the script.",
  "sinks": "The data collected (hostname and IP address) is sent via the Discord webhook using the send() method, which acts as a sink for potential data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "The hostname and IP address are collected from the system (sources) and then sent to an external Discord webhook URL (sink) during the installation process (flow).",
  "anomalies": "The code constructs a Discord webhook payload and sends system information to an external URL during package installation, which is unusual and suspicious behavior. The webhook URL is hardcoded, indicating potential misuse. The class name is obfuscated, which is often a sign of malicious intent. The code does not appear to perform any legitimate setup tasks beyond this activity.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom install class that overrides the standard install process. Within the overridden method, it constructs a Discord webhook client using a hardcoded URL and then retrieves the hostname and IP address of the system. It then sends this information to the specified Discord webhook. This behavior is malicious because it exfiltrates system information during package installation without user consent. The obfuscated class name and direct use of a Discord webhook URL indicate malicious intent. The code does not perform any other legitimate setup operations or package configuration, further supporting the malicious nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by exfiltrating system hostname and IP address during package installation through an embedded Discord webhook. This indicates an active data exfiltration mechanism embedded in a setup script, which is highly suspicious and potentially harmful.",
