{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, but it includes malicious behavior to exfiltrate system information.",
  "sources": "Reading system hostname and IP address via socket.gethostname() and socket.gethostbyname()",
  "sinks": "Sending data via a Discord webhook URL using the discord library and RequestsWebhookAdapter()",
  "flows": "Code flow gathers hostname/IP, then constructs and sends a message containing this info to a Discord webhook during package installation",
  "anomalies": "Uses a Discord webhook for data exfiltration, custom class name, obfuscated variable names, and includes malicious behavior within an installation override",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides the 'install' method. During installation, it creates a Discord webhook client with a hardcoded URL, retrieves hostname and IP address, and sends this information to the webhook. The variables are obfuscated, and the overall structure is atypical for legitimate setup scripts. The webhook URL and system info exfiltration are clear indicators of malicious intent, possibly for remote data theft or surveillance.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, performing data exfiltration of hostname and IP address via a Discord webhook during package installation. It is likely part of a supply chain attack or malicious package intended to harvest system info without user consent.",
