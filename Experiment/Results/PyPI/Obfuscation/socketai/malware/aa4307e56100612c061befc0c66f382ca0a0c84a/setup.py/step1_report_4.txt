{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be setting up a Python package, but it also includes malicious behavior to exfiltrate hostname and IP address information via a Discord webhook during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the system's hostname and IP address using socket.gethostname() and socket.gethostbyname(). It also includes a hardcoded Discord webhook URL.",
  "sinks": "The code sends the collected hostname and IP information to an external Discord webhook, which is a potential data exfiltration point.",
  "flows": "The code retrieves hostname/IP (sources) and then sends this data to the Discord webhook URL (sink) during the installation process.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses obfuscated class and function names, and the webhook URL is hardcoded in the script. The use of socket to get system info combined with webhook exfiltration suggests malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script modifies the install command class to include additional behavior during package installation. It retrieves system hostname and IP, then sends this data to a Discord webhook, which could be used for unauthorized surveillance or data theft. The code's obfuscated class and method names indicate an attempt to hide malicious activity. The webhook URL is embedded directly, and the code executes during installation, making it a clear exfiltration attempt embedded within what appears to be a package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior designed to exfiltrate system information via a Discord webhook during package installation. The use of obfuscation, hardcoded webhook, and data collection indicates malicious intent. It should be considered dangerous and potentially malicious malware.",
