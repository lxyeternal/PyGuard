{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, but it contains malicious behavior intended to send host information to a Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "The code reads the hostname and IP address using socket.gethostname() and socket.gethostbyname().",
  "sinks": "The data (hostname and IP) is sent to a Discord webhook URL via the discord Webhook client, which is a potential exfiltration of system information.",
  "flows": "The source (hostname and IP) flows into the webhook send method, which transmits the data to an external server (Discord).",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes the use of a webhook to secretly send system info, the presence of obfuscated class and variable names, and the injection of code within a setup script intended for package installation.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools and overrides the install command to include malicious code. During installation, it retrieves system hostname and IP address, then sends this data to a Discord webhook URL. The webhook URL is hardcoded, and the code is embedded in what appears to be a legitimate setup.py file. The use of obfuscated class name and variable names indicates an attempt to conceal malicious intent. The code does not perform any legitimate setup operations related to the package and focuses solely on data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains malicious behavior designed to collect and transmit system information to an external Discord server, likely for malicious tracking or data theft. It is embedded within a setup script, which could be used to infect or compromise systems during package installation.",
