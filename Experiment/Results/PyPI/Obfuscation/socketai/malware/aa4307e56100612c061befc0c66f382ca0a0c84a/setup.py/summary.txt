  "conclusion": "The code performs active data exfiltration during package installation, indicating high malicious intent. The obfuscation and embedded webhook URL reinforce this assessment. The scores assigned in the reports—malware: 1.0, obfuscated: 0.8, security risk: 1.0—are justified and consistent with the evidence. This package should be flagged as malicious and removed from distribution channels."
