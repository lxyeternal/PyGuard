{
  "purpose": "The script appears to set up a Python package using setuptools, with a custom install command that executes decrypted code on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "os.name check, the encrypted Fernet token, the encrypted payload, and the imported modules requests and Fernet.",
  "sinks": "exec() with decrypted code, potential network request via requests, and usage of Fernet for decryption.",
  "flows": "During installation on Windows, the script decrypts a payload with Fernet and executes it via exec().",
  "anomalies": "The presence of encrypted payloads, execution of decrypted code, use of requests and Fernet without clear justification, and obfuscation of intent through encrypted data.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup and install classes from setuptools, then defines a custom install class that, on Windows (os.name == 'nt'), imports requests and Fernet, decrypts an encrypted payload, and executes it via exec(). The setup() function specifies package info, including a custom install command that triggers the decryption and execution. The payload is encrypted with Fernet, and the decryption key is embedded in the code. The execution of decrypted code during installation is suspicious, as it can run arbitrary code on the target system. The use of encrypted payloads, exec(), and conditional Windows-specific behavior are common in malicious installers or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior characteristic of malicious installers: it decrypts and executes code during installation on Windows, which can be used to run arbitrary malicious code. The obfuscation via encrypted payloads and dynamic execution indicates potential malicious intent.",
