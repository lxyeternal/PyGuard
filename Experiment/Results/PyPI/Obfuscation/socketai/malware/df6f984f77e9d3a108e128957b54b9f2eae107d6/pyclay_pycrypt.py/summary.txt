  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates clear malicious behavior, including remote script downloads, payload encryption/decryption, dynamic execution, and obfuscation. The high scores assigned in the reports (malware: ~0.85, obfuscated: ~0.8, security risk: ~0.9) are justified and consistent with its traits. It should be classified as malicious, and further analysis or blocking is recommended."
