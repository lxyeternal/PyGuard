  "purpose": "Evaluate the security implications of a single import statement involving an obfuscated object from the 'pycrypt' package.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'BQRxyMcQZOnBXNbNmnUEVjXNXzVWpmoy' from 'pycrypt'.",
  "sinks": "No data flows, sinks, or untrusted data handling present in the code snippet.",
  "flows": "N/A – only an import statement with no further code execution or data transfer.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated object name suggesting concealment; minimal code with no context; absence of usage or behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement importing an obfuscated object from 'pycrypt'. The high suspicion of obfuscation is justified, but no malicious activity or data leaks are demonstrated. The lack of further code prevents definitive conclusions, though the suspicion warrants caution. Scores for obfuscation are high (~0.8), malware is low (~0.1-0.2), and security risk is moderate (~0.3). These scores are consistent with the cautious analysis, acknowledging obfuscation without evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet is minimal and involves an obfuscated import, raising suspicion but lacking concrete evidence of malicious behavior. Further context or usage details are necessary for a definitive assessment. The current risk is low, but obfuscation warrants monitoring.",
