  "conclusion": "The code functions as a legitimate, complex HTTP response processing library with significant obfuscation. No malicious payloads or sabotage are detected, but the heavy obfuscation and layered decompression could be exploited if fed malicious data. The current scores are justified, and further static/dynamic analysis is recommended before deployment in untrusted environments."
