  "purpose": "Utility classes for thread-safe limited-size dictionary and HTTP header parsing, with heavy obfuscation but no malicious activity.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for container management, header lines for parsing.",
  "sinks": "Internal data structures, optional disposal functions, no network or system calls.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into internal containers; header lines parsed into internal structures.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation, suspicious import of threading with obfuscated name, dynamic extension for Python 2, complex class and variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code implements thread-safe containers and header parsing utilities, with obfuscated class and variable names. No network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications are evident. Obfuscation appears to be for concealment rather than malicious intent. The threading import with an obfuscated name and dynamic method extensions suggest an attempt to hinder reverse engineering, but functionality remains standard. The code manages data structures with thread safety, size limits, and header parsing, consistent with utility functions. No evidence of malicious payloads or backdoors is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility classes for HTTP header management and caching, heavily obfuscated but without any signs of malicious behavior. The high obfuscation scores are justified, but malware risk remains negligible. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score should be set to 0.",
