  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated error handling library for network operations, with no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware remains unlikely. The overall security risk is low, primarily due to obfuscation and lack of active malicious actions."
