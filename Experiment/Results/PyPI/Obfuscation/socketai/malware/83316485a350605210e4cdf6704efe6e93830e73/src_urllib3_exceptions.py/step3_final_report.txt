{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exceptions and wrappers for network errors, URL validation, and error parsing.",
  "sources": "URL parameters, error response data, exception arguments",
  "sinks": "Exception messages incorporating untrusted data, potential for data leaks if logged insecurely",
  "flows": "Data from URLs and error info into exception messages and class attributes",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names, use of dynamic string formatting, inheritance from standard network exceptions",
  "analysis": "The code consists primarily of class definitions for error handling, with obfuscated names that obscure purpose but do not indicate malicious intent. No network activity, data exfiltration, or payloads are present. Exception messages include untrusted data but are confined to error reporting. The obfuscation appears to be a concealment tactic rather than malicious behavior. The structure suggests a network error handling library, possibly part of a larger framework, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated error handling library for network operations, with no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware remains unlikely. The overall security risk is low, primarily due to obfuscation and lack of active malicious actions.",
