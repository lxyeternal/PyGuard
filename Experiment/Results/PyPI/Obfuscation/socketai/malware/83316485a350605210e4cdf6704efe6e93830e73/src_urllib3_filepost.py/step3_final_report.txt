  "purpose": "Utility functions for generating multipart/form-data payloads with cryptographically secure boundaries and encoding data into HTTP request bodies.",
  "sources": "os.urandom() for boundary generation, input data (dicts or iterables), standard libraries for encoding and data handling",
  "sinks": "BytesIO buffer where the multipart payload is constructed, ultimately used for HTTP transmission",
  "flows": "Random boundary generated by mNTIklxEkrGpuHTmNHCHSMRaSxiQPnkt() flows into payload boundary markers; input data flows into payload parts; data is written into BytesIO buffer",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names, but no suspicious hardcoded secrets, network activity, or malicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code generates multipart/form-data payloads using secure random boundaries, processes input data flexibly, and encodes data into the payload buffer. Obfuscation is present but appears to be a naming choice rather than malicious. No network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. The use of standard libraries and cryptographically secure randomness suggests legitimate utility code. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard multipart/form-data payload generator with obfuscated identifiers. Despite obfuscation, there is no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or data theft. The overall security risk is low, and the malware likelihood is negligible.",
