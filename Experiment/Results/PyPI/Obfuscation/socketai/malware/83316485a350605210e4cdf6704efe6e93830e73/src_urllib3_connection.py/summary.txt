  "conclusion": "The code is a complex, obfuscated network connection module with advanced SSL handling. While no direct malicious activity is evident, the heavy obfuscation and SSL complexity could be exploited maliciously. It warrants further static and dynamic analysis before deployment, especially in supply chain contexts."
