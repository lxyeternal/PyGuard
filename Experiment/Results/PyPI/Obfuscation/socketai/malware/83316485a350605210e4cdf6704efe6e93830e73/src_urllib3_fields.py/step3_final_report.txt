  "purpose": "Utility functions for MIME type guessing, header encoding (including RFC 2231), and constructing headers for HTTP or email messages.",
  "sources": "Parameters for filename, header parts, and header parts dictionary; external function utils.encode_rfc2231.",
  "sinks": "Header dictionaries, encoded header strings, and constructed header lines.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed through encoding functions and then assembled into header strings or stored in header dictionaries.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation with nonsensical variable and function names; usage of external encoding function without provided implementation; no network or file system activity; complex encoding logic that could be misused.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides MIME type guessing, RFC 2231 header encoding, and header construction functions. Obfuscated variable names suggest an attempt to conceal purpose, but the logic aligns with standard header handling routines. No network activity, data exfiltration, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are evident. The external function 'utils.encode_rfc2231' is used for header encoding, which is standard but warrants verification. The functions are designed for preparing headers, possibly for email or HTTP multipart data. The overall structure and content do not indicate malicious behavior, but the obfuscation warrants cautious scoring.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility module for MIME and header processing, with obfuscation likely intended to hide complexity rather than malicious intent. No active malicious behavior or security risks are detected in this fragment. The malware score is correctly set to 0. The obfuscation score is high, justified by variable and function name obscurity. The risk score is low, reflecting the benign functionality but acknowledging the obfuscation. Overall, the code is low risk with no evidence of malicious activity, suitable for use with caution due to obfuscation.",
