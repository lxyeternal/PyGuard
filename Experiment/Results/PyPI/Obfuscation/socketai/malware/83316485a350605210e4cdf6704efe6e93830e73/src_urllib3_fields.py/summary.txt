  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility module for MIME and header processing, with obfuscation likely intended to hide complexity rather than malicious intent. No active malicious behavior or security risks are detected in this fragment. The malware score is correctly set to 0. The obfuscation score is high, justified by variable and function name obscurity. The risk score is low, reflecting the benign functionality but acknowledging the obfuscation. Overall, the code is low risk with no evidence of malicious activity, suitable for use with caution due to obfuscation."
