  "conclusion": "The code exhibits covert data collection and exfiltration during package setup, with obfuscated variables and hardcoded webhook. The behavior is suspicious and potentially malicious, aligning with supply chain attack patterns. The scores assigned are justified and should be considered high risk. This package should be flagged for further investigation or removal."
