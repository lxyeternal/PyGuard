  "anomalies": "Unusual and potentially malicious activity: collection of extensive system info (hostname, user, OS info, network config, running processes) and transmitting it over the network during package installation. Use of obfuscated variable names suggests an attempt to hide intent. The code executes system commands that gather sensitive information and sends it to an external URL without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that, during the install process, executes multiple system commands based on the platform to gather detailed system information. It then composes a JSON payload containing this info and sends it via a cURL POST request to a Slack webhook URL. The commands collect hostname, user identity, network configuration, OS info, and running processes. The code is obfuscated with unclear variable names and uses dynamic data collection to exfiltrate environment details, indicating malicious intent and data leakage. There are no other external libraries that could indicate benign or malicious behavior; the primary concern is data exfiltration during installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears malicious due to its behavior of collecting comprehensive system data and sending it to an external webhook during package installation. This activity could be used for surveillance or exfiltration without user consent. The obfuscated variable names and the nature of data collection point towards malicious intent.",
