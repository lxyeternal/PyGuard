{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package with additional custom installation steps that collect system information and send it via a Slack webhook.",
  "sources": "os.popen() calls retrieving system info (uname, ifconfig, curl, systeminfo, ipconfig, tasklist, whoami, hostname), sys.platform check, environment variables (not directly used but involved in data collection).",
  "sinks": "os.system() executing a curl command to send collected system info as a JSON payload to an external Slack webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Data is collected via os.popen() calls, then formatted into a JSON string, and finally sent over the network using os.system() with a curl command.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs extensive system information gathering and exfiltration by posting data to an external URL without user consent. The data includes hostname, user identity, public IP, OS info, running processes, which are sent unencrypted and could be used maliciously. The naming of variables is obfuscated, and the package metadata is minimal, which can be suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a setup script that, during installation, executes a class method that collects detailed system information based on the OS platform. This information includes hostname, current working directory, user identity, system info, network configuration, and process list. It then constructs a JSON payload and sends it to an external Slack webhook via a curl command embedded in os.system(). The obfuscated class name and variable names suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent. The data exfiltration is automatic and silent, raising concerns about privacy invasion or malicious data collection. No malicious system modification or destructive actions are observed, but the collection and transmission of sensitive system information without consent is suspicious and could be used for reconnaissance or malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs covert data collection of system information and exfiltrates it to an external server during package installation, which is suspicious behavior indicative of potential malicious activity. The use of obfuscated variable names and the silent exfiltration method further supports this concern.",
