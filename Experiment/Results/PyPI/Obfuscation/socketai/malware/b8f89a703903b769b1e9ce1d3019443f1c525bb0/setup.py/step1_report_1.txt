{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, including a custom install command that collects system information and posts it to a Slack webhook.",
  "sources": "Reading system information via os.popen() calls ('uname -a', 'ifconfig', 'curl ifconfig.me', 'systeminfo', 'ipconfig', 'tasklist', 'whoami', 'hostname') and environment data such as current working directory and process platform.",
  "sinks": "Sending collected system data via an HTTP POST request with curl to a Slack webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Data collected from os.popen() and environment variables flows into the os.system() call, which sends a JSON payload to an external URL.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes collecting detailed system info and posting it to an external Slack webhook during package installation, which could be used for data exfiltration. The webhook URL is hardcoded and visible, which is suspicious. The code uses obfuscated variable names, which may be an attempt to conceal malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom install class that executes additional commands during installation. It collects system info such as OS details, network configuration, running processes, user info, and hostname. It then formats this info into a JSON string and sends it via curl to a specific Slack webhook URL. The code runs this info collection on all platforms, with specific commands for Windows, Linux, and macOS. The use of obfuscated variable names and the act of exfiltrating detailed system info during package installation are suspicious behaviors. No malicious code like data theft, reverse shells, or damaging actions is explicitly present, but the behavior of data collection and external transmission is highly suspicious in the context of a package installation process.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be collecting detailed system information and sending it to an external Slack webhook during package installation, which is potentially malicious or at least maliciously intrusive. The use of obfuscation and hardcoded webhook further raises suspicion. It may be used for reconnaissance or data exfiltration without user consent.",
