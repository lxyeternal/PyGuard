{
  "purpose": "The code performs covert system information collection and exfiltration during package installation, likely for malicious reconnaissance or data theft.",
  "sources": "os.popen() calls retrieving system info (uname, ifconfig, curl, systeminfo, ipconfig, tasklist, whoami, hostname); hardcoded webhook URL; package setup invocation.",
  "sinks": "os.system() executing curl command to send data to external webhook.",
  "flows": "Data is gathered via os.popen() commands, stored in variables, then formatted into JSON and transmitted via os.system() to the webhook URL during setup.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and class names; data exfiltration during package install without user notification; hardcoded webhook URL; collection of sensitive system info; execution of external network requests in setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, during installation, collects detailed system info tailored to the OS platform. It then constructs a JSON payload with hostname, user, IP, OS info, and current directory, and sends this data to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL using a curl command embedded in os.system(). The variable names are intentionally obfuscated, likely to conceal malicious intent. This behavior occurs silently during package installation, with no user consent or notification, indicating potential malicious activity such as data exfiltration or reconnaissance. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.75-0.8, obfuscation ~0.8-0.9, security risk ~0.8-0.9) are consistent with this behavior. The activity is highly suspicious and could be part of a supply chain attack, warranting high security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits covert data collection and exfiltration during package setup, with obfuscated variables and hardcoded webhook. The behavior is suspicious and potentially malicious, aligning with supply chain attack patterns. The scores assigned are justified and should be considered high risk. This package should be flagged for further investigation or removal.",
