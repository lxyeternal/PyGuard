  "conclusion": "The code is a credential-stealing malware targeting Roblox cookies, exfiltrating data via a webhook. Despite a bug with an undefined variable, the malicious intent is clear. The high scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified. The code's purpose is malicious, and it employs obfuscation and multi-browser targeting to maximize impact."
