{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract Roblox cookies from various browser profiles and send them to a specified Discord webhook, likely for malicious credential theft.",
  "sources": "The code reads browser cookies for the domain 'roblox.com' from Edge, Chrome, Firefox, and Opera browsers using the 'browser_cookie3' library.",
  "sinks": "The extracted cookies are sent via POST requests to a Discord webhook URL, which acts as the data exfiltration point.",
  "flows": "Cookies are retrieved from different browsers, converted to strings, parsed to extract '.ROBLOSECURITY' tokens, and then transmitted to the webhook endpoint.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains hardcoded webhook URL, uses multiple threads to perform simultaneous cookie theft, and references an undefined variable 'cookie' in the requests payload. The functions are very similar but named differently, possibly obfuscated or automated. The payload uses Markdown formatting in the message content, and exception handling suppresses errors without logging.",
  "analysis": "The script attempts to steal Roblox session cookies by accessing browser cookies for 'roblox.com' across multiple browsers. Each function targets a different browser profile, extracts the '.ROBLOSECURITY' cookie value, and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook. The use of threading indicates an attempt to perform concurrent exfiltration. The variable 'cookie' used in the requests is not defined within the functions, suggesting a coding error or obfuscation. The code's primary intent appears to be clandestine data theft and exfiltration of user credentials, which is malicious. The overall structure and repeated patterns indicate a likely malicious purpose rather than benign functionality.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious as it harvests user cookies from multiple browsers and exfiltrates them to an attacker-controlled webhook. It exhibits typical behavior of credential theft malware, with multiple threads and hardcoded webhook URL, and contains an error or obfuscation in the variable 'cookie'. Overall, it constitutes a significant security threat.",
