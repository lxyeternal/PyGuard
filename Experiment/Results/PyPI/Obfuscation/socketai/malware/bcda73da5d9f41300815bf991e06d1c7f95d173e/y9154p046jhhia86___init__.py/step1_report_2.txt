  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract Roblox cookies from various browsers and send them via a webhook to an external server, potentially for malicious purposes such as credential theft.",
  "sources": "Reads cookies related to 'roblox.com' from browsers (Edge, Chrome, Firefox, Opera) using browser_cookie3.",
  "sinks": "Sends cookie data to a remote webhook URL via HTTP POST requests, potentially leaking sensitive information.",
  "flows": "Extracts cookies from browsers -> processes cookie strings -> sends cookies to external server via webhooks.",
  "anomalies": "Uses multiple browser cookie libraries in separate functions, all aimed at extracting 'ROBLOSECURITY' cookies and sending them externally. The variable naming is obfuscated and inconsistent, indicating an attempt to conceal intent. The code lacks any user interaction or obvious benign purpose, and employs threading to perform multiple network requests simultaneously, which could be used to evade detection or increase speed of data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports browser_cookie3, requests, and threading, then defines multiple functions that attempt to access cookies from different browsers (Edge, Chrome, Firefox, Opera) specifically targeting 'roblox.com' cookies. Each function extracts the 'ROBLOSECURITY' cookie from the browser's cookie storage, converts it to a string, and then attempts to parse the cookie value. The functions then send this cookie data to a remote webhook URL using requests.post(). The functions are executed concurrently in separate threads. The variable names are obfuscated, which is common in malicious scripts to hinder analysis. The code performs no validation or sanitization, and the data is directly exfiltrated without user consent or notification. This behavior aligns with credential theft, a typical malicious activity. There are no signs of obfuscation techniques like encoding, encryption, or code compression beyond variable name obfuscation. The code is straightforward but intentionally obscured via variable names. Overall, it appears designed to exfiltrate user cookies from browsers without consent, indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is malicious, aimed at stealing Roblox session cookies from various browsers and exfiltrating them to an external webhook. It employs obfuscation and multithreading to conceal its purpose and increase efficiency. It poses a significant security risk as it involves credential theft and data exfiltration, with no benign purpose evident.",
