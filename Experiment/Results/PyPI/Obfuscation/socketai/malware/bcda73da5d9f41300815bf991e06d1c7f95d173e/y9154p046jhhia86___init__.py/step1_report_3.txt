{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract Roblox cookies from different browser profiles and send them via a Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "browser_cookie3 library functions that read cookies from Edge, Chrome, Firefox, and Opera browsers for the domain 'roblox.com'.",
  "sinks": "requests.post() function that sends the extracted cookie data to an external Discord webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Cookie data is retrieved from browser cookies (sources), converted to strings, parsed to extract '.ROBLOSECURITY' tokens, and then sent to the webhook (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Repeated use of try-except blocks suppressing errors; code constructs similar functions for multiple browsers with identical logic; variable names are obfuscated and inconsistent; potential variable 'cookie' is referenced in requests but not defined, suggesting a bug or incomplete code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines four functions, each targeting a different browser (Edge, Chrome, Firefox, Opera) to extract cookies for 'roblox.com'. Each function reads cookies, converts to string, attempts to parse out the '.ROBLOSECURITY' token, and sends it via a POST request to a specified webhook URL. The functions are run concurrently in threads. The code appears to be designed for harvesting user session tokens and exfiltrating them. The presence of multiple similar functions with obfuscated variables and silent error handling suggests an attempt to avoid detection or debugging. The variable 'cookie' used in the request payload is undefined, indicating possible incomplete or broken code, but the intent to exfiltrate cookies is clear.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a cookie stealer targeting Roblox user tokens, exfiltrating them to an external webhook. Its structure, repeated similar functions, obfuscation, and silent error handling are typical indicators of malicious intent designed for credential theft. The code does not contain other malicious activities like system modification or malware payloads, but its purpose is clearly malicious in the context of user credential theft.",
