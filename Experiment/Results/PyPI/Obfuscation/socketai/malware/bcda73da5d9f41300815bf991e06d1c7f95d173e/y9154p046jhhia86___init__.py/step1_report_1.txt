  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract Roblox cookies from various browser profiles and send them to a specified Discord webhook, likely for unauthorized access or credential theft.",
  "sources": "Reads cookies from browser profiles for Edge, Chrome, Firefox, and Opera browsers using browser_cookie3 with domain 'roblox.com'.",
  "sinks": "Sends extracted cookies via HTTP POST requests to a Discord webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Browser cookie retrieval functions extract cookies and format them into a string; these are then sent to the webhook URL through POST requests. Multiple threads execute these functions concurrently.",
  "anomalies": "Uses broad exception handling that suppresses errors, hardcoded webhook URL, and attempts to extract 'ROBLOSECURITY' cookies from browser profiles. The variable 'cookie' used in requests is undefined, indicating a likely bug or obfuscation. The code operates in a way that suggests intent to steal user cookies without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The script imports browser_cookie3 to access stored cookies from popular browsers, targeting the domain 'roblox.com'. It defines four functions, each retrieving cookies from a specific browser profile (Edge, Chrome, Firefox, Opera), converts the cookie data to string, attempts to parse the 'ROBLOSECURITY' token, and sends this data to a hardcoded Discord webhook. The functions are run concurrently via threading. The absence of any user input validation, use of a hardcoded webhook, and the focus on stealing Roblox cookies indicate malicious intent focused on credential theft. The undefined variable 'cookie' in the requests payload suggests either incomplete code or obfuscation, but the overall purpose remains clear.",
  "conclusion": "The code acts as a credential stealer targeting Roblox cookies by extracting them from multiple browsers and exfiltrating them to an attacker-controlled webhook. The use of threading, broad exception handling, and hardcoded webhook strongly indicate malicious behavior with no legitimate user benefit.",
