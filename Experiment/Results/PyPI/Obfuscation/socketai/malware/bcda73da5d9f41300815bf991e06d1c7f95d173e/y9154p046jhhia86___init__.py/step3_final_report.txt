  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract Roblox cookies from various browsers and exfiltrate them via a webhook, indicating malicious intent to steal user credentials.",
  "sources": "Browser cookie storage for 'roblox.com' accessed via browser_cookie3 (edge, chrome, firefox, opera).",
  "sinks": "Requests POST to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL with the cookie data.",
  "flows": "Browser cookie data → parsing to extract 'ROBLOSECURITY' cookie → sending via requests.post to webhook.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad exception handling suppresses errors; variable 'cookie' used in payload is undefined; multiple similar functions with obfuscated variable names; use of threading for concurrent exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code targets multiple browsers to extract Roblox cookies, parses the cookie value, and attempts to send it to an external webhook. The variable 'cookie' in the payload is undefined, indicating a bug or obfuscation, but the overall intent is clear. The functions run concurrently with threading, and broad exception handling conceals errors. The purpose is credential theft and data exfiltration, which is malicious. Obfuscation is evident in variable naming, and the code's structure suggests an attempt to evade detection. The high malware score (0.9) and security risk score (0.9) are justified by the malicious activity. The obfuscation score (0.8) reflects variable name obfuscation and code repetition.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a credential-stealing malware targeting Roblox cookies, exfiltrating data via a webhook. Despite a bug with an undefined variable, the malicious intent is clear. The high scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified. The code's purpose is malicious, and it employs obfuscation and multi-browser targeting to maximize impact.",
