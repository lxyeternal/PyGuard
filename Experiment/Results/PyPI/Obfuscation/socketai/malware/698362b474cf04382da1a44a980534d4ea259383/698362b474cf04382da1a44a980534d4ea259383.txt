      "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with obfuscated identifiers. While obfuscation raises suspicion, there is no evidence of malicious activity. The dependencies could be misused if exploited, but the code itself is safe. The overall security posture is low risk, with moderate suspicion due to naming obfuscation."

      "conclusion": "The code is malicious, designed for credential harvesting and data exfiltration of Roblox user information. It exhibits obfuscation and multiple cookie source usage, confirming its intent to steal sensitive data without user consent. The high malware and security risk scores are justified. The script should be flagged and mitigated immediately due to its privacy and security implications."
