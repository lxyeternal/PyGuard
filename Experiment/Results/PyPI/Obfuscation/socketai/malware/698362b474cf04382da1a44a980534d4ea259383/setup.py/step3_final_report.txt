{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup configuration with obfuscated identifiers and dependencies that could be misused if exploited, but contains no active malicious logic.",
  "sources": "Reading the setup() call, the obfuscated variable 'EwSDjveWFODLVHSakkPjFYhpKwkCKsDA', and the dependencies listed in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "Potential misuse of dependencies like 'browser_cookie3', 'discordwebhook', 'robloxpy', and 'requests' if exploited after installation; no direct data leaks or malicious network activity within this code.",
  "flows": "Obfuscated package name and dependencies are declared; no data flows or external input handling present.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and package names; absence of actual code logic; only setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated identifiers, which raises suspicion but does not contain malicious code or data flows. Dependencies could be exploited if misused, but their inclusion alone is not malicious. The obfuscation suggests an attempt to conceal purpose but is not definitive proof of malicious intent. The malware score is low (0.2), reflecting no active malicious behavior. The obfuscation score is moderate to high (~0.6-0.7), justified by naming. The overall security risk remains low (~0.2-0.3), as no malicious actions are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with obfuscated identifiers. While obfuscation raises suspicion, there is no evidence of malicious activity. The dependencies could be misused if exploited, but the code itself is safe. The overall security posture is low risk, with moderate suspicion due to naming obfuscation.",
