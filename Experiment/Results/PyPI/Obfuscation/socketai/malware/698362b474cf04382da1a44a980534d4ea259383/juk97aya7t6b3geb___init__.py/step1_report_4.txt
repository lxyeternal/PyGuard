{
  "purpose": "The code appears to extract Roblox cookies from various browsers, validate them, retrieve user information from Roblox's API, and post this data to a Discord webhook, potentially for monitoring or malicious data collection.",
  "sources": "Browser cookie files (firefox, chromium, edge, opera, chrome) for '.ROBLOSECURITY' cookie; HTTP request to ipify.org for IP address; Roblox API endpoints for user info and profile data.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST request to a Discord webhook URL with collected user data; potentially exposing sensitive data such as cookies, IP, and user info.",
  "flows": "Cookies are read from browser files -> cookies validated with Roblox API -> user info retrieved -> data formatted and sent via webhook.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function and variable names, unclear purpose of certain variables, incomplete code referencing variables like 'rid', 'roblox_cookie', 'rolimons', 'roblox_profile', 'robux', 'crdate', 'rap', 'friends', 'age', 'ip_address' which are not defined or assigned, suggesting data collection or exfiltration intent. The script also attempts to gather cookies from multiple browsers and exfiltrate user data without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The script reads cookies from various browser cookie files to obtain the '.ROBLOSECURITY' token. It then checks the validity of the cookie with Roblox's API. If invalid, it sends a message to a webhook indicating the cookie has expired. For valid cookies, it fetches user information, including UserID, username, Robux balance, account age, creation date, and headshot image. The script constructs URLs for user profile and another service (rolimons). It attempts to send this collected data, along with the cookie, IP address, and other info, to a Discord webhook. The code uses obfuscated variable and function names, which indicates an attempt to conceal its purpose, likely for malicious data harvesting.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious as it collects Roblox cookies and user information from various browsers, validates and retrieves user data, then exfiltrates it via a webhook. The obfuscated variables and incomplete references suggest malicious intent to harvest user credentials and private info without user consent.",
