{
  "purpose": "The script appears to extract Roblox '.ROBLOSECURITY' cookies from various browsers, validate the cookie, retrieve user info from Roblox API, and then send user data and possibly a screenshot or profile link to a specified webhook. Its intent seems to be data collection and exfiltration of Roblox account information.",
  "sources": "Browser cookies stored in Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Opera, and Chrome (again) domains for 'roblox.com'; user input from requests to Roblox API and web endpoints.",
  "sinks": "POST request to a webhook URL with collected Roblox user information, including cookie content; GET requests to Roblox and third-party sites; internal API calls for user info, user profile, and avatar data.",
  "flows": "Browser cookie reading (source) -> cookie validation -> Roblox API data retrieval -> data aggregation -> webhook POST (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded webhook URL and message ID; use of obscure variable names; concatenation of user data into webhook message; multiple browser cookie domains checked for Roblox cookie; lack of error handling for API failures; use of an unverified external link 'rolimons.com'; script collects sensitive cookie info and exfiltrates it.",
  "analysis": "The code reads Roblox '.ROBLOSECURITY' cookies from various browsers, likely aiming to steal Roblox session tokens. It validates the cookie using Roblox API. If valid, it gathers user info, such as UserID, username, balance, account age, profile picture, and other details. Then, it constructs a message with these details and posts it to a specified webhook URL, which indicates possible exfiltration. The code uses obfuscated variable names, hardcoded message ID, and a webhook URL, all typical of malicious scripts. There are no clear indications of damage to system files or reverse shells, but the core behavior is focused on unauthorized access to user account data and exfiltration. The code does not appear to have obfuscated code beyond variable naming and does not perform destructive actions or system damage.",
  "conclusion": "This script is designed to steal Roblox account cookies from browsers, validate them, extract user info, and send this data to an external webhook, indicating malicious intent focused on account data theft. The use of hardcoded webhook details and cookie harvesting strongly suggests malicious behavior.",
