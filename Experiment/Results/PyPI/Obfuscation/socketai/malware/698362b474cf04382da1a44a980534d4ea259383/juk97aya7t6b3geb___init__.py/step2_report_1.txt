  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n**Purpose:** Harvests Roblox cookies, validates them, retrieves user info, and exfiltrates via webhook.\n\n**Sources:** Multiple browser cookie stores for '.ROBLOSECURITY'.\n\n**Sinks:** External webhook, Roblox API endpoints.\n\n**Flow:** Cookie extraction → validation → user info retrieval → data posting.\n\n**Anomalies & Concerns:**\n- Uses multiple browser sources, indicating an attempt to maximize cookie harvesting.\n- The variable `roblox_cookie` used in the webhook message is **undefined**, suggesting incomplete or obfuscated code.\n- The code's variable names are nonsensical, likely obfuscation.\n- The script posts user data and cookies to an external URL without user consent.\n- The code seems designed to exfiltrate sensitive user data.\n\n**Analysis & Conclusion:**\n- The core behavior is malicious: credential theft, data exfiltration.\n- The code is not benign; it demonstrates typical credential harvesting.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.2\n- **Malware:** 0.8\n- **Security Risk:** 0.9\n\n**Verdict:** **Malicious, high risk.** The undefined variable and multiple cookie sources reinforce its malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n**Purpose:** Collect Roblox account info, verify cookies, send data to webhook.\n\n**Sources:** Browser cookies, Roblox API, external IP.\n\n**Sinks:** Webhook URL, requests.post, os.system.\n\n**Anomalies & Concerns:**\n- Hardcoded webhook URL and message ID.\n- References to variables like `roblox_cookie`, `rid`, `rolimons`, `roblox_profile`, etc., are **undefined**, indicating incomplete or obfuscated code.\n- Uses `os.system()` for command execution, which could be malicious.\n- The code attempts to gather and send sensitive data without user consent.\n\n**Analysis & Conclusion:**\n- The script's behavior aligns with credential theft and data exfiltration.\n- No evidence of destructive system actions, but the intent is malicious.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.6\n- **Malware:** 0.8\n- **Security Risk:** 0.9\n\n**Verdict:** **Malicious, high security risk.**\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n**Purpose:** Extract Roblox cookies, validate, get user info, exfiltrate.\n\n**Sources:** Browser cookies, Roblox API, third-party links.\n\n**Sinks:** Webhook with user info, cookie data.\n\n**Anomalies & Concerns:**\n- Multiple browser sources for cookies.\n- Uses obfuscated variable names.\n- Collects cookies, user info, profile links.\n- Sends data to external webhook.\n\n**Analysis & Conclusion:**\n- Clear credential harvesting activity.\n- No system damage, but significant privacy violation.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.3\n- **Malware:** 0.8\n- **Security Risk:** 0.9\n\n**Verdict:** **Malicious, high risk.**\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n**Purpose:** Harvest Roblox cookies, validate, get user info, send to webhook.\n\n**Sources:** Browser cookies, Roblox API.\n\n**Sinks:** Webhook URL, user data.\n\n**Anomalies & Concerns:**\n- Obfuscated variables.\n- Multiple browser sources.\n- Collects and exfiltrates user data without consent.\n- Uses obfuscation to conceal intent.\n\n**Analysis & Conclusion:**\n- Credential theft and exfiltration activity.\n- No system harm, but privacy breach.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.7\n- **Malware:** 0.8\n- **Security Risk:** 0.9\n\n**Verdict:** **Malicious, high security risk.**\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n**Purpose:** Collect Roblox cookies, user info, send to webhook.\n\n**Sources:** Browser cookies, Roblox API, IP.\n\n**Sinks:** External webhook, data exfiltration.\n\n**Anomalies & Concerns:**\n- Hardcoded webhook URL.\n- Multiple cookie sources.\n- Obfuscated variable names.\n- No user consent, data sent externally.\n\n**Analysis & Conclusion:**\n- Credential harvesting and data exfiltration.\n- No system damage, but privacy and security breach.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.3\n- **Malware:** 0.8\n- **Security Risk:** 0.9\n\n**Verdict:** **Malicious, high risk.**\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary & Final Assessment**\n\n- **Presence of Malicious Behavior:** All reports describe scripts that harvest Roblox cookies and user data, then exfiltrate via webhooks.\n- **Code Quality & Obfuscation:** Many variables are obfuscated or undefined, indicating an attempt to conceal malicious intent.\n- **Potential Damage:** The scripts do not appear to damage systems directly but pose a serious privacy and account security threat.\n- **Scores Consistency:** All reports' malware and risk scores are high (~0.8-0.9), which aligns with their malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **My Final Estimates:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0.85** (consistent with credential theft and data exfiltration)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0.5** (some obfuscation present, but not heavily complex)\n- **Risk Score:** **0.9** (very high, given the privacy breach and potential account hijacking)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nAll reports indicate malicious scripts designed for credential harvesting and data exfiltration, with high security risk. The scripts are obfuscated to some degree but not heavily complex, and they exfiltrate sensitive user data without consent. The scores assigned are appropriate; I would slightly adjust the obfuscation score to 0.5, reflecting moderate obfuscation.\n\n**Final Recommendation:** These scripts are malicious, pose a high security threat, and should be flagged and mitigated immediately.",
