{
  "purpose": "The script appears to collect Roblox account information, including cookies from browsers, and send user data and profile info to a specified webhook URL, possibly for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "Browser cookies from Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Opera, and Chrome-based browsers with domain 'roblox.com'; HTTP requests to retrieve IP and user info; Roblox API responses for user details.",
  "sinks": "Requests to a webhook URL with collected user data; potentially sensitive information including cookies, IP address, username, Robux balance, account age, creation date, and profile links.",
  "flows": "Browser cookie retrieval (sources) → IP and Roblox user info fetch (sources) → Data compilation → HTTP POST request to webhook URL with user info (sink)",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded message ID and webhook URL; usage of browser cookies for Roblox authentication; collecting and transmitting detailed user info including cookies, IP, and Roblox account data; unprotected data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code reads browser cookies related to Roblox, attempting to extract '.ROBLOSECURITY' tokens from multiple browsers. It then verifies the cookie validity via Roblox API, fetches user info such as UserID, Username, Robux balance, account age, and creation date. This information, along with the user's IP address, is compiled into a message sent to a webhook URL. The script uses obfuscated variable names and hardcoded URLs, indicating an intent to secretively collect and exfiltrate user data. No evidence of backdoors, damage, or system harm; however, the collection and transmission of sensitive user data without consent indicates malicious intent, primarily for exploitation or unauthorized data harvesting.",
  "conclusion": "The script is designed to clandestinely extract Roblox account cookies and user information from multiple browsers and send this data to an external webhook. It exhibits malicious intent through secretive data collection, cookie theft, and unprotected exfiltration. The presence of hardcoded tokens and URL suggests an attack or abuse scenario rather than legitimate use. Overall, the code is malicious with a high security risk.",
