{
  "purpose": "The script appears to collect Roblox account information and cookies, verify the cookies, retrieve user data, and then send this data to a specified webhook.",
  "sources": "Browser cookies (firefox, chromium, edge, opera, chrome) for '.ROBLOSECURITY'; HTTP request to api.ipify.org for IP address; Roblox API endpoints for user info; external functions to get user profile data",
  "sinks": "Webhook URL for sending data; requests.post to external webhook; use of os.system to execute commands",
  "flows": "Cookie extraction from browser, validation of cookie, retrieval of user info, assembling data, then sending via POST to webhook URL",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded webhook URL and message ID; code attempting to access and send sensitive cookie data; inconsistent variable naming and unused variables; some code references undefined variables such as 'roblox_cookie', 'rid', 'rolimons', 'roblox_profile', 'robux', 'crdate', 'rap', 'friends', 'age', 'ip_address' which suggests incomplete or obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code extracts Roblox cookies from various browsers, checks their validity, retrieves user data such as user ID, username, Robux balance, premium status, account age, and creation date. It then constructs a message including these details and sends it to a predefined webhook URL. The use of os.system for command execution, hardcoded URLs, and potential referencing of undefined variables indicates possible malicious intent to exfiltrate sensitive data. The code does not appear to perform any benign or user-friendly functions, and the presence of code referencing system commands and external communication points to malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This script is designed to collect and exfiltrate sensitive Roblox account information, including cookies and user details, via a webhook. It exhibits typical malicious behavior associated with credential harvesting and data theft. The code contains some incomplete or obfuscated parts, but overall it strongly suggests malicious intent with high security risk.",
