  "purpose": "The code harvests Roblox '.ROBLOSECURITY' cookies from multiple browsers, validates them via Roblox API, retrieves user information, and exfiltrates this data to an external webhook, indicating malicious credential theft and data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Browser cookie stores for '.ROBLOSECURITY' across Firefox, Chromium, Edge, Opera, Chrome.",
  "sinks": "External webhook URL, Roblox API endpoints, requests.post, os.system commands.",
  "flows": "Cookie extraction from browsers -> validation via Roblox API -> user info retrieval -> data formatting -> POST request to webhook with user data.",
  "anomalies": "- Use of multiple browser sources for cookie harvesting.\n- Undefined variables such as 'roblox_cookie', 'rid', 'rolimons', 'roblox_profile', indicating incomplete or obfuscated code.\n- Hardcoded webhook URL and message ID.\n- Obfuscated variable and function names.\n- No user consent or notification.\n- Use of os.system for command execution.\n- Data exfiltration without encryption or user awareness.",
  "analysis": "The script's core behavior involves harvesting Roblox account cookies from various browsers, validating these cookies through Roblox API, retrieving user details such as UserID, username, Robux balance, account age, creation date, and profile URL, then formatting this data into a message and sending it to an external webhook URL. The code uses multiple browser cookie sources, indicating an attempt to maximize data collection. Several variables used in the message payload are undefined, suggesting obfuscation or incomplete code, which is typical in malicious scripts designed to conceal intent. The script exfiltrates sensitive user data without consent, posing significant privacy and security risks. The use of hardcoded URLs, message IDs, and obfuscated variable names further supports malicious intent. The code does not perform any destructive system actions but focuses on credential theft and data exfiltration, which are high-severity security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, designed for credential harvesting and data exfiltration of Roblox user information. It exhibits obfuscation and multiple cookie source usage, confirming its intent to steal sensitive data without user consent. The high malware and security risk scores are justified. The script should be flagged and mitigated immediately due to its privacy and security implications.",
