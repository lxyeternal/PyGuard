  "conclusion": "The code is unequivocally malicious, exhibiting comprehensive data theft, keylogging, webcam and screenshot capture, persistence, and remote command capabilities. Its obfuscation and encryption routines further support its intent to evade detection. The scores of malware=1, obfuscated=0.8-0.9, and security risk=1 are justified and aligned with its behavior."
