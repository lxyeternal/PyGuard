{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a comprehensive malicious information stealer and remote access tool, designed to extract browser data, system information, capture webcam and screenshots, keylog keystrokes, execute remote commands, and exfiltrate data via network channels while maintaining persistence.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, browser profile files (SQLite, LevelDB), local system files (cookies, passwords, history, tokens, wallet data), user input (keylogger), webcam, screenshots, and network requests.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission via socket.io events and HTTP requests, file reads/writes, encryption/decryption routines, self-copying to startup directories, and remote command execution through os.popen().",
  "flows": "Data is read from system/browser files and environment variables, decrypted or encrypted as needed, then transmitted over network channels; keylogging data is captured and sent; webcam and screenshots are saved and exfiltrated; persistence is achieved by copying itself into startup folders.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable and class names, encrypted keys, dynamic code execution, extensive use of encryption routines, self-replication, and multiple data collection modules operating concurrently.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits multiple typical malware behaviors: it harvests sensitive data from browsers and system files, employs encryption for data handling, maintains persistence via copying into startup folders, captures webcam images and screenshots, logs keystrokes, and exfiltrates data through socket.io events and HTTP requests. The obfuscated variable names and encryption routines indicate deliberate evasion. The functions for data collection, encryption, and network communication are consistent with malicious intent. The presence of self-copying, persistence, and extensive data harvesting confirms its malicious nature. The code's structure and behavior strongly suggest it is designed for system reconnaissance, data theft, and remote control, with high confidence in malicious classification.",
  "conclusion": "The code is unequivocally malicious, exhibiting comprehensive data theft, keylogging, webcam and screenshot capture, persistence, and remote command capabilities. Its obfuscation and encryption routines further support its intent to evade detection. The scores of malware=1, obfuscated=0.8-0.9, and security risk=1 are justified and aligned with its behavior.",
