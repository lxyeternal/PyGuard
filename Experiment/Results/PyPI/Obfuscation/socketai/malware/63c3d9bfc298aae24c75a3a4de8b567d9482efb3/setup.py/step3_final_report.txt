{
  "purpose": "The code creates a temporary script that imports an unknown library and executes it, indicating potential malicious activity during installation.",
  "sources": "os.getenv('temp') to determine temp directory, open() to write 'code.py', and subprocess.check_call() to execute the script.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.check_call(['python', ...]) executes the created script, which imports 'dshttpslib'—potentially executing malicious code.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'temp' -> file creation of 'code.py' with 'import dshttpslib' -> sleep delay -> subprocess executes 'code.py' -> imports 'dshttpslib'.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names, minimal error handling, writing and executing code during setup, import of non-standard 'dshttpslib'.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an obfuscated install class that, during installation, writes a script 'code.py' in the temp directory containing 'import dshttpslib'. It then delays for 3 seconds and executes this script via subprocess. The script's import of 'dshttpslib' is suspicious, as it's not a standard library, and the pattern of dynamic code creation and execution is typical of malicious behavior. The obfuscation and delayed execution further support malicious intent. The setup dependencies are benign, but the dynamic execution pattern is a common tactic in supply chain attacks. The high scores assigned in the reports (around 0.75-0.9 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk) are justified by this behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious and potentially malicious behavior by dynamically creating and executing code that imports an unknown library, with obfuscated identifiers. The pattern aligns with common malicious supply chain tactics, warranting high security concern. The scores in the reports are appropriate and reflect the high likelihood of malicious intent.",
