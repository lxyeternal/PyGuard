  "conclusion": "Most reports are consistent and reasonable. The primary adjustment is to increase the malware score in Report 4 from 0.3 to approximately 0.7, aligning with the identified red flags. Overall, the assessments are cautious but justified, with no evidence of confirmed malicious code. The risk scores are appropriate, with moderate concern only in Report 4."
