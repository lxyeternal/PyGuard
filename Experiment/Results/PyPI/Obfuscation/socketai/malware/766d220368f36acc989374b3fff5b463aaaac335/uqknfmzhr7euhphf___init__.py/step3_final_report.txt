  "purpose": "Assessment of supply chain security and malicious potential in the provided Python code snippets or descriptions.",
  "sources": "Any code reading environment variables, user input, or external data; potential code execution points like 'exec' or 'eval'.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, data exfiltration points, code execution functions, or file modifications.",
  "flows": "Data from sources (inputs, environment variables) to sinks (network, code execution, file system).",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'exec'/'eval', hardcoded secrets, obfuscation patterns, unvalidated inputs, suspicious imports.",
  "analysis": "The reports generally lack explicit code, making detailed source-to-sink analysis impossible. Reports 2 and 3 describe benign code with low suspicion; Report 4 notes red flags such as 'exec', 'eval', hardcoded secrets, and obfuscation, indicating moderate suspicion. The scores reflect these observations, with the exception that the malware score in Report 4 could be slightly increased to better represent the suspicious patterns. The other reports' scores are appropriate given the limited or benign descriptions.",
  "conclusion": "Most reports are consistent and reasonable. The primary adjustment is to increase the malware score in Report 4 from 0.3 to approximately 0.7, aligning with the identified red flags. Overall, the assessments are cautious but justified, with no evidence of confirmed malicious code. The risk scores are appropriate, with moderate concern only in Report 4.",
