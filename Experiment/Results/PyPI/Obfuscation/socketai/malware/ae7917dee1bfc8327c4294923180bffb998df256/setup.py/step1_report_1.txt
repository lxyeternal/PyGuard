{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a custom setup script for a Python package, incorporating an extended install command with some network activity and environment data collection.",
  "sources": "Code reads environment information via 'whoami' and 'echo $HOME'; it also constructs and executes 'curl' commands to send data to an external IP address.",
  "sinks": "The 'curl' commands send data to an external server, potentially leaking user and system info. Also, 'os.popen' is used to execute system commands.",
  "flows": "Data from 'whoami' and 'HOME' environment variables are incorporated into URLs, which are then fetched via 'curl'—this flow could leak user/system info externally.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'os.popen' to run system commands and send their output to an external server is suspicious; the URL points to an IP address with no apparent legitimate purpose; dynamic code execution and network activity during installation are unusual.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions that gather system info ('whoami', home directory) and platform info. It then constructs 'curl' commands to send this data to an external IP address, which is a common pattern for data exfiltration. The functions are called during package installation via a custom 'install' class, which overrides standard behavior. The use of 'os.popen' for system commands and the external network requests during setup are highly unusual and suspicious. There are no clear benign purposes for these actions, and they could be used for malicious data collection or backdoor purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting user and system information during installation and exfiltrating it to an external IP address. The use of network calls within setup scripts, especially with no clear legitimate purpose, suggests potential malicious intent. The overall security risk is high.",
