{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information ('whoami', 'echo $HOME', platform details) and exfiltrates this data to a remote server via HTTP requests during package installation, indicating malicious intent for data theft or backdoor access.",
  "sources": "Execution of 'whoami', 'echo $HOME', and platform info functions; construction of URLs with embedded system info; 'os.popen' calls executing system commands; network requests to hardcoded IP during setup.",
  "sinks": "HTTP requests sending system info to external IP; potential data exfiltration points during package installation.",
  "flows": "System info is gathered via system commands, passed into URL strings, and transmitted through 'curl' commands executed with 'os.popen' during the setup process.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated function names; execution of network requests during package setup; hardcoded external IP addresses; dynamic URL construction with system info; use of 'os.popen' for system commands and network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions with obfuscated names that collect system info ('whoami', 'echo $HOME', platform details). During package installation, it executes 'curl' commands to send this info to a remote server at a fixed IP address, embedding system data into URLs. The use of 'os.popen' for executing system commands and network requests during setup is suspicious and indicative of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration. The obfuscated function names and dynamic URL construction further suggest concealment. The network activity occurs during installation, which is atypical for benign setup scripts. No legitimate purpose for this behavior is evident, and it aligns with common malicious patterns like covert data theft or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious indicators: data exfiltration during package setup, obfuscation, and suspicious network activity. The high malware score (~0.9), obfuscation (~0.8), and security risk (~0.9) are justified given the evidence. It should be flagged as malicious and investigated further.",
