  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious indicators: data exfiltration during package setup, obfuscation, and suspicious network activity. The high malware score (~0.9), obfuscation (~0.8), and security risk (~0.9) are justified given the evidence. It should be flagged as malicious and investigated further."
