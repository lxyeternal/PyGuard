      "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, stealthy execution of a PowerShell command during setup, indicating high suspicion of malicious activity. The high scores are justified based on obfuscation, stealth, and potential for malicious payload delivery. Further decoding of the command is recommended to confirm intent. Overall, the code should be considered highly suspicious and warrants caution or removal."
