  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks since the code contains no active data handling or processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no operational or unusual elements; it is essentially empty or a placeholder with no behavior. There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is essentially empty or a minimal stub with no logic, variables, functions, or external interactions. It does not read input, process data, or perform any operations. Without additional code, there are no identifiable sources, sinks, or flows, nor any anomalies or suspicious behavior. Given this, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a placeholder or an incomplete snippet with no operational or suspicious elements. Based on the provided content, it can be considered safe, with a very low malware or security risk score.",
