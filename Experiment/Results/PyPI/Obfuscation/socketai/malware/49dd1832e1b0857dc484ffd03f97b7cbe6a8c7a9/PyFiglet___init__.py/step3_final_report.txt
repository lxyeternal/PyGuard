{
  "purpose": "To evaluate open-source Python dependency code snippets for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and anomalies, and assign consistent scores based on analysis.",
  "sources": "Environment variable reads, data processing functions, input/output operations, network or file access points, and any dynamic code execution or suspicious patterns.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network transmissions, file modifications, or system calls that could lead to security issues or malicious activity.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or input functions to sinks like network connections, file writes, or system commands, with no suspicious or malicious patterns identified.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation techniques, and no suspicious control flow or external communications detected.",
  "analysis": "All provided reports either lack code or describe benign code snippets performing routine data handling and processing. The scores assigned—malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0.2—are consistent with the benign nature of the code. High confidence is justified given the straightforward analysis and absence of suspicious patterns. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are observed or inferred. The low security risk scores reflect minimal potential for harm, aligned with standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The reports are accurate and consistent, correctly indicating no malicious activity or obfuscation, with low security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate given the analysis, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.2,
