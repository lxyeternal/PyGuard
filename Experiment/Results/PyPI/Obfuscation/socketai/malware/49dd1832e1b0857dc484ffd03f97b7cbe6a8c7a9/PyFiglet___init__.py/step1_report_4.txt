  "purpose": "This code appears to be designed for data processing or utility functions, but without additional context, its specific purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "It reads environment variables, input data from function parameters, and potentially reads files or network data depending on usage.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include printing to stdout, writing to files, or network transmissions if present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources or environment variables through processing functions to output or storage points.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials or suspicious code constructs are detected. No obfuscated code features are present. No network activity or system calls are evident in the provided snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Python libraries and constructs without obfuscation. No malicious patterns such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system manipulation are apparent. Usage of environment variables and data handling appears benign, with no signs of dangerous operations or secrets hardcoded. The code structure is straightforward, with no unusual dynamic execution or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks in this code snippet. It seems to perform routine data handling tasks without suspicious activity.",
