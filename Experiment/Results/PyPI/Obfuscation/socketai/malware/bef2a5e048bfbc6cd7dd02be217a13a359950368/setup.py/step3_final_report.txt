  "purpose": "A simple Python setup script using setuptools with static metadata.",
  "sources": "The setup() function parameters: name, version, author, description, packages.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static data only.",
  "flows": "N/A - static data; no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious author name 'Badman' and description 'You should not be using this.', but no malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with hardcoded metadata. No dynamic code, obfuscation, or external inputs are involved. The metadata is unusual but does not imply malicious behavior. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk scores (~0.1-0.2) due to metadata suspicion. No active malicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign; metadata suspicion does not translate into actual malicious behavior. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's content. No modifications are necessary.",
