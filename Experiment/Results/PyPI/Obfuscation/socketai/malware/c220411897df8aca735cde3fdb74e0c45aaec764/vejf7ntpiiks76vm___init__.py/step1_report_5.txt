  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform a specific function within a larger Python project, but without seeing the actual code, the intent cannot be definitively determined.",
  "sources": "Input sources could include environment variables, user input, or external files; however, the code content is not provided, so specific sources cannot be identified.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or execution of dynamic code; details cannot be confirmed without code.",
  "flows": "Source-to-sink paths cannot be established without seeing the actual code, but typical flows involve data reading, processing, and output or transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies can be identified without the code; possible signs include hardcoded credentials, obfuscated sections, or unusual behavior, but none are evident here.",
  "analysis": "Insufficient code content provided for analysis. Cannot determine sources, sinks, or suspicious behavior without actual code. No anomalies can be identified without further details. The evaluation is limited to the provided prompt, which lacks the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "Unable to perform a thorough review due to absence of code. No evidence of malicious behavior or security risks can be confirmed without analyzing the actual source code. Please provide the code snippet for a detailed assessment.",
