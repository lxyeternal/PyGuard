{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, but it includes an embedded class that executes potentially malicious behavior during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the hostname and IP address via socket.gethostname() and socket.gethostbyname() methods. It also imports modules like discord, aiohttp, and asyncio, and constructs an async function that sends data to a Discord webhook.",
  "sinks": "The data (hostname and IP address) is sent to a remote Discord webhook URL, which can be used for data exfiltration or command and control communications.",
  "flows": "The hostname and IP are retrieved as sources, then passed into an asynchronous function that sends this data to an external server (Discord webhook), during the install process via a custom install class.",
  "anomalies": "Embedding code that performs network communication during package installation is unusual and suspicious. The code uses obfuscated class and function names, which indicates attempts to conceal behavior. The webhook URL is hardcoded and points to an external domain, and the code executes asynchronously during installation.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py file, but it contains an embedded class 'nMYmlAvChleKAiOkZPtIFQiRUafcaNcG' that overrides the install command. During installation, this class runs code that gathers system hostname and IP address, then asynchronously sends this information to a specific Discord webhook URL. The obfuscation of class and function names, along with the network activity during installation, suggests malicious intent, potentially for data theft or remote command control. The code does not perform any other installation tasks or modifications, focusing solely on data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes malicious behavior—specifically, exfiltration of system hostname and IP address during package installation via a Discord webhook. The obfuscation and unusual embedding of network activity in a setup script indicate malicious intent, making this package highly suspicious and potentially dangerous to install.",
