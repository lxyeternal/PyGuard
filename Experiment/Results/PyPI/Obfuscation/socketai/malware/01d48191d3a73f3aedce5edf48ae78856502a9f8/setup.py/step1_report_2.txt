{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, but it includes hidden malicious behavior that sends system information to an external Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), socket.gethostbyname(), and the embedded Webhook URL used for sending data.",
  "sinks": "The asyncio task sends data (hostname and IP address) to a remote Discord webhook, which could be used for data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "The code collects hostname and IP address, then asynchronously sends this data to a remote webhook, potentially leaking system info during package installation.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and function names, the use of a Discord webhook to transmit system info, and the code executing in the custom install class suggest concealment of malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom install command that, upon execution, imports system and network modules to gather hostname and IP information. It then creates an asynchronous function that sends this data to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is a common exfiltration method. The class and function names are obfuscated, indicating an attempt to conceal malicious intent. The code runs during package installation, which can surreptitiously leak user system info without explicit user consent. The use of standard libraries (setuptools) combined with malicious network activity is suspicious and indicative of a supply chain attack or malicious backdoor embedded in a seemingly benign package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to secretly collect and transmit system information to an external server via Discord webhook during package installation. This behavior is malicious, constituting a backdoor or data exfiltration mechanism embedded within a Python package setup script.",
