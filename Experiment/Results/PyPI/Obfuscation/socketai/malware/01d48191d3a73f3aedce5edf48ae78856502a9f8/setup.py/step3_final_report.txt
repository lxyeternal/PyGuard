{
  "purpose": "The code exfiltrates system hostname and IP address during package installation by sending data asynchronously to a hardcoded Discord webhook, using obfuscated class and method names to conceal malicious intent.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), socket.gethostbyname(), the hardcoded webhook URL",
  "sinks": "discord.Webhook.send() method over network",
  "flows": "System info (hostname/IP) → asynchronous webhook message",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class/method names, code executes during setup, hardcoded webhook URL, network activity in setup script",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, during package setup, collects hostname and IP address and sends this data to an external Discord webhook asynchronously. The obfuscated naming and execution during installation are suspicious. The code's behavior aligns with malicious data exfiltration, with no benign explanation. The network request is direct and unencrypted, indicating covert data theft. The obfuscation and hardcoded URL further suggest malicious intent. The activity is consistent with supply chain sabotage or privacy violation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, performing covert data exfiltration during package installation. The obfuscation, hardcoded webhook, and execution context confirm malicious intent. It poses a high security risk and should be flagged as malware.",
