{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom installation class that, upon installation, sends a message to a specific Discord webhook, including the hostname and IP address of the machine where it is installed.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), socket.gethostbyname(), and the code within the async function that gathers system information and constructs a message.",
  "sinks": "Discord webhook URL (sending data via Discord API), asyncio event loop (executes asynchronous HTTP request).",
  "flows": "During installation, the code collects hostname and IP address, then sends this information to a remote Discord webhook URL asynchronously.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated class and function names, immediate network activity during package installation, sending system info to a third-party service without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code employs a custom class derived from 'install' that overrides the 'run' method to execute a network operation. It imports 'discord', 'aiohttp', and 'asyncio' to send system details to a Discord webhook. The webhook URL is hardcoded, and the code executes during package installation, which is unusual. The use of obfuscated class and function names suggests an attempt to conceal malicious intent. The script does not validate or ask for user permission before transmitting data, indicating potential privacy violations. The primary behavior is collecting hostname and IP address, then exfiltrating this data via a webhook, which can be considered malicious if done without user knowledge or consent.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains malicious behavior, specifically the collection and exfiltration of system information via a Discord webhook during installation. The obfuscated naming and network activity indicate malicious intent, likely aimed at spying or data collection without user awareness.",
