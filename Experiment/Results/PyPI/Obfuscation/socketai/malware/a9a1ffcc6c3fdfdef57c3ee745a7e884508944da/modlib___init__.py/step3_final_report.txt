  "purpose": "A simple Python script that outputs the string \"Hola\".",
  "sources": "No external inputs, environment variables, or data sources; only a static print statement.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or outputted to external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists; the code executes a single print statement with a static string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; the code is straightforward and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a basic print statement with no inputs, outputs, or complex logic. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and safety. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code does not perform any network activity, data leakage, or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security concerns. The reports are accurate and appropriate. No further action is necessary.",
