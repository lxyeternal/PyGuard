      "confidence": 0.95,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation, dynamic script generation, and execution in a manner consistent with malware or backdoor activity. The use of base64 decoding, environment variables, temporary directories, and error logging suggests an intent to conceal malicious payloads and maintain persistence. Given these behaviors, the code should be classified as malicious with a malware score of 1, obfuscation score of 1, and a security risk score of 1. The overall threat level is extremely high, and the package should be considered dangerous and avoided."

      "conclusion": "Based on the available code and the reports' lack of detailed evidence, there is no indication of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities. The obfuscation is noted but not conclusive of malicious intent. Overall, the security risk is minimal, and the code appears safe under current information."

      "obfuscated": 0.8,
      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated and manages network connections through proxies, with default localhost addresses and minimal validation. While no explicit malicious activity is confirmed, the obfuscation, default local addresses, and complex connection setup indicate potential misuse or covert backdoor functionality. The overall security risk is moderate to high, warranting cautious handling and further analysis."

      "conclusion": "The code does not demonstrate malicious behavior but employs obfuscation and flexible network configuration that could be exploited if misused. The malware score is low, but the obfuscation and configurability justify a moderate security concern. Continuous validation and cautious deployment are recommended."

      "conclusion": "The code functions as a legitimate, albeit heavily obfuscated, proxy client supporting SOCKS4, SOCKS5, HTTP, and HTTPS protocols. No malicious payloads, sabotage, or backdoors are evident. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not indicate malicious intent. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score should remain at 0."
