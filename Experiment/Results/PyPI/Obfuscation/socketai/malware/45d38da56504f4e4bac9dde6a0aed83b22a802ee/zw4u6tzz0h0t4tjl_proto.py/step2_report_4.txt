  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the code's behavior, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a SOCKS proxy client supporting SOCKS4 and SOCKS5, with connection, authentication, and address resolution. No malicious activity or backdoors are evident.\n\n- **Analysis:** The report correctly identifies standard proxy client behavior. The code uses asyncio, uvloop, and standard socket operations, with no signs of malware or obfuscation beyond variable naming.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0.1 — minimal obfuscation, mainly variable names.  \n  - Risk: 0.2 — low, as the code is a typical proxy client.\n\n**Conclusion:** The scores seem reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on obfuscation and the potential for misuse.\n\n- **Analysis:** The obfuscation is higher (0.5), which is consistent with the code's variable naming. The functionality remains standard for a SOCKS proxy client, with no evidence of malicious intent.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — no malware detected.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0.7 — consistent with the code style.  \n  - Risk: 0.3 — cautious but justified.\n\n**Conclusion:** The scores are appropriate. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Implements SOCKS4, SOCKS5, and HTTP/HTTPS protocols with asynchronous socket handling. Obfuscated variable names and protocol implementations are present.\n\n- **Analysis:** The report correctly notes the obfuscation and protocol support. No hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads are evident. The extensive protocol handling could be misused, but in isolation, it appears legitimate.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — no malware.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0.5 — reasonable given the obfuscation level.  \n  - Risk: 0.2 — low.\n\n**Conclusion:** The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Implements SOCKS and HTTP/HTTPS proxies with asynchronous socket operations, obfuscated code, but no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Analysis:** The extensive obfuscation (0.8) is noted, but functionality aligns with proxy clients. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are evident.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — justified.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0.8 — matches the description.  \n  - Risk: 0.2 — acceptable.\n\n**Conclusion:** The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar SOCKS proxy client with support for multiple protocols, obfuscated variable names, and no malicious activity.\n\n- **Analysis:** The report correctly emphasizes the obfuscation and standard protocol implementation. No suspicious external activity or secrets are detected.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — consistent.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0.7 — appropriate.  \n  - Risk: 0.2 — justified.\n\n**Conclusion:** The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which is consistent with the absence of malicious behavior in the code.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** Vary from 0.1 to 0.8, reflecting the variable naming and code style. These are justified.\n- **Risk scores:** Generally low, as the code is a proxy client, which can be misused but isn't inherently malicious.\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malware detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.6 — moderate obfuscation, primarily variable naming.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — typical for proxy client code, with potential misuse but no direct malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The code, as presented, appears to be a standard, albeit obfuscated, implementation of a SOCKS proxy client supporting multiple protocols. No evidence of malware, sabotage, or supply chain compromise is present based on the provided snippets and reports.",
