  "conclusion": "The code functions as a legitimate, albeit heavily obfuscated, proxy client supporting SOCKS4, SOCKS5, HTTP, and HTTPS protocols. No malicious payloads, sabotage, or backdoors are evident. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not indicate malicious intent. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score should remain at 0."
