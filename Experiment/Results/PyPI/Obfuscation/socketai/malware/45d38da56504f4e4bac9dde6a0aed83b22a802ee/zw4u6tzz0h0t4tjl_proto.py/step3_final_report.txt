{
  "purpose": "Implements SOCKS proxy client supporting SOCKS4, SOCKS5, HTTP, and HTTPS protocols with asynchronous socket operations and address resolution.",
  "sources": "Input data includes socket connections, address info, and request byte sequences.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows into socket send/recv operations, address resolution, and connection establishment.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through address resolution, protocol negotiation, authentication, and socket communication to output or further network transmission.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation via variable names and constants; no hardcoded credentials or malicious payloads; complex control flow typical of protocol implementations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive, obfuscated SOCKS/HTTP proxy client supporting multiple protocols with asynchronous socket handling. No evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration routines is present. The obfuscation appears to serve concealment rather than malicious intent. The code's structure and behavior align with legitimate network utility software. The high obfuscation score reflects variable naming and constants, but no malicious activity is detected. The low malware score is justified, and the risk score accounts for potential misuse due to proxy capabilities but remains low overall.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a legitimate, albeit heavily obfuscated, proxy client supporting SOCKS4, SOCKS5, HTTP, and HTTPS protocols. No malicious payloads, sabotage, or backdoors are evident. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not indicate malicious intent. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score should remain at 0.",
