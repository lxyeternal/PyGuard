{
  "purpose": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes with obfuscated names, without any operational logic, data handling, or external interactions. It appears to be benign, with obfuscation possibly for concealment.",
  "sources": "Class definitions for exception objects, no data input or external data sources present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external interactions; no untrusted data processing or system calls observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow beyond class declarations; no source-to-sink paths exist.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class names, which could suggest concealment but are superficial as no malicious behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class declarations inheriting from standard exception classes, with obfuscated names. There is no logic, data processing, or external communication. The obfuscation may be for concealment but does not imply malicious intent. Malware and security risk scores are appropriately low (0.0 and ~0.1-0.2 respectively). The obfuscation score is high (~0.7-0.9), justified by the nonsensical class names. Overall, the code appears benign with no active threats or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting only of obfuscated exception class definitions with no operational or malicious activity. The current scores are justified, and no further action is necessary.",
