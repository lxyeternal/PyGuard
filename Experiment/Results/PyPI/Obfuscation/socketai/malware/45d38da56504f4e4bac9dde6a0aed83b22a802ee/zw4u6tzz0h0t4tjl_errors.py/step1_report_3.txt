  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for use in larger Python projects, possibly for error handling or control flow.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and inheritance structures; no external input reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks detected; primarily class inheritance structures.",
  "anomalies": "Use of seemingly obfuscated class names; no clear purpose for such naming; no use of input, environment variables, or external data sources; no suspicious or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from standard exception classes. No data input, output, network calls, or other suspicious activities are present. The class names appear obfuscated, but this alone is not malicious. The code's structure suggests it might be intentionally obfuscated or generated, but there are no indicators of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. There are no hardcoded credentials, no data leaks, and no suspicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code only defines several custom exception classes with obfuscated names. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within this fragment. The obfuscation appears superficial and does not indicate malicious intent.",
