{
  "purpose": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes, mostly inheriting from existing exception classes, with no additional functionality or logic.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and inheritance declarations. No input or data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; classes are only defined but not instantiated or used.",
  "anomalies": "The class names appear obfuscated, consisting of random characters, which could suggest attempts to conceal intent. No actual logic or behavior is implemented within these classes.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only class declarations for custom exceptions with obfuscated names, inheriting from base exception classes. There are no functions, methods, data handling, or external interactions. The obfuscated class names could be an attempt to hide malicious purpose, but as no active code or logic is present, there is no evidence of malicious behavior. The lack of functionality suggests these are placeholders or intentionally obscure class names for future use or concealment.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit any malicious activity or security risks. It only declares a set of obfuscated exception classes with no operational code or data flow. The obfuscated names might be suspicious, but without additional code, there is no indication of malicious intent or security threats.",
