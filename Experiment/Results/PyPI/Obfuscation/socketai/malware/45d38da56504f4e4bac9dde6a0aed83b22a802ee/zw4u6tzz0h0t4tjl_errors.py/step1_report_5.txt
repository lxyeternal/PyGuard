{
  "purpose": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes, mostly inheriting from a base exception class, with no additional logic or functionality.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading present; no input sources used.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, outputs, or external communications observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths; no source-to-sink flows since the code only defines classes.",
  "anomalies": "Class names appear obfuscated and nonsensical, which could be a form of obfuscation or hiding intent. No actual code execution or logic is present. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions with obfuscated class names. No data input, output, or control flow exists. The lack of logic, code execution, or network activity suggests benign intent. The obfuscated class names may indicate attempts to hide purpose, but without operational code, this is not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of obfuscated exception class definitions with no malicious behavior or security issues. The obfuscation may suggest intent to hide, but without additional context or code, there are no signs of malware or security risks.",
