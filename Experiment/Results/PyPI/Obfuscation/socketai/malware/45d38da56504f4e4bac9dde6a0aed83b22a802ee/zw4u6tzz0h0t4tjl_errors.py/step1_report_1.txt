{
  "purpose": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes, likely intended for use in a larger application for error handling.",
  "sources": "Class definitions are the source of code; no input reading or external data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow paths to untrusted data, system calls, or external interfaces are evident.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input, as the code only defines classes without processing data.",
  "anomalies": "Class names are intentionally obfuscated, with seemingly random alphanumeric identifiers; no operational code or logic is present.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains class declarations for exception subclasses with obfuscated names. These classes do not contain methods or logic that could perform malicious activities. There are no data inputs, outputs, or suspicious behaviors such as network activity, file operations, or code execution. The obfuscation appears to be a method to hide intent, but without additional code or context, it is not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be obfuscated class definitions for custom exceptions, with no active malicious or suspicious behavior present. The obfuscation might be for code hiding or obfuscation purposes but does not indicate malicious intent by itself.",
