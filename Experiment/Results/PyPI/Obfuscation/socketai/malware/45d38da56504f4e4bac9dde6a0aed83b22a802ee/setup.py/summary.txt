  "confidence": 0.95,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation, dynamic script generation, and execution in a manner consistent with malware or backdoor activity. The use of base64 decoding, environment variables, temporary directories, and error logging suggests an intent to conceal malicious payloads and maintain persistence. Given these behaviors, the code should be classified as malicious with a malware score of 1, obfuscation score of 1, and a security risk score of 1. The overall threat level is extremely high, and the package should be considered dangerous and avoided."
