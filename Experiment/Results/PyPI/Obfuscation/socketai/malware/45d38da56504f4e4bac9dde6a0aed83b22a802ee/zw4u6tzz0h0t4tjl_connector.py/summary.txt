  "security_risk": 0.4,

  "conclusion": "The code does not demonstrate malicious behavior but employs obfuscation and flexible network configuration that could be exploited if misused. The malware score is low, but the obfuscation and configurability justify a moderate security concern. Continuous validation and cautious deployment are recommended."
