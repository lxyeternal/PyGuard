{
  "purpose": "The code defines a simple function that adds 2 to its input.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'os' module and a relative import 'add'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the function simply performs an addition operation.",
  "anomalies": "The function name appears obfuscated ('EOCKpZFXqcfcOBILpSjALSfAevduNlbP'), which could indicate an attempt to hide its purpose. The import of 'add' is unused, which is suspicious but not malicious on its own. The code imports 'os' but does not use it, which could be an indication of obfuscation or incomplete code.",
  "analysis": "The code contains an obfuscated function name that does not reveal its purpose, which is a common tactic in malicious scripts. The unused import statements (os and add) could be attempts to hide malicious behavior or to prepare for future malicious actions. The function itself performs a benign addition operation with no side effects. There are no external data flows, network activity, or sensitive operations present. The minimal code structure and obfuscated naming raise some suspicion but do not definitively indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is minimal and appears obfuscated, which is suspicious. However, it performs a harmless addition operation and lacks any malicious actions or data exfiltration mechanisms. The obfuscation and unused imports warrant caution, but there is no clear evidence of malicious behavior based solely on this fragment.",
