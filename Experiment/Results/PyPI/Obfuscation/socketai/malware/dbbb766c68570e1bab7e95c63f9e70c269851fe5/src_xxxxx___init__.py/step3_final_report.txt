{
  "purpose": "The code defines a simple function that adds 2 to its input, with obfuscated naming and unused imports.",
  "sources": "Imports 'os' and local module 'add', which are not used; function input 'x'.",
  "sinks": "The function returns a value derived from input 'x'; no external sinks or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Input 'x' flows into the function, which performs addition and returns the result; no external data or network activity involved.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function name; unused imports 'os' and 'add'; no comments or documentation; trivial arithmetic operation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a benign addition operation with obfuscated naming and unused imports, which could be an attempt at concealment but does not indicate malicious intent. No external data sources, sinks, or malicious behaviors are detected. The obfuscation and unused imports are suspicious but not malicious. The function's simplicity and lack of external activity suggest low risk. The obfuscated name and unused modules justify a moderate obfuscation score, but malware and security risks remain minimal.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with obfuscation tactics that warrant cautious monitoring but no evidence of malicious behavior or security threats. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score around 0.7, and risk score approximately 0.2 are appropriate.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
