  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the issues, and evaluate the scoring.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is a simple function adding 2 to its input, with obfuscated function name.\n- Imports 'os' and 'add' modules, neither of which are used.\n- No data flows from untrusted sources, no network or external data activity.\n- No evident malicious operations such as data exfiltration, system modification, or network activity.\n- The obfuscated function name and unused imports suggest possible obfuscation but do not confirm malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Correctly states the function adds 2; no malicious behavior.\n- **Errors:** No errors; the analysis is accurate.\n- **Scores:** Malware at 0.0, securityRisk 0.2 seem reasonable given benign code.\n- **Obfuscation:** 0.6 is appropriate, considering the function name and unused imports.\n- **Confidence:** 0.7, seems justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Correctly describes the code.\n- **Errors:** No errors; analysis is consistent.\n- **Scores:** Malware at 0 is appropriate; securityRisk 0 is reasonable.\n- **Obfuscation:** 0.7 is appropriate, given the obfuscated name and unused imports.\n- **Confidence:** 0.6, acceptable.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Correct.\n- **Errors:** No; the suspicion about obfuscation is valid.\n- **Scores:** Malware at 0 is correct; securityRisk 0.2 is reasonable.\n- **Obfuscation:** 0.7 fits the obfuscated name.\n- **Confidence:** 0.4 is slightly low but acceptable given the benign nature.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Correct.\n- **Errors:** No; the suspicion about obfuscation and import is valid.\n- **Scores:** Malware at 0, securityRisk 0.1-0.2 seem appropriate.\n- **Obfuscation:** 0.5-0.7 is consistent.\n- **Confidence:** 0.6 is reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Correct.\n- **Errors:** No; the analysis is consistent.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, securityRisk 0.1 are appropriate.\n- **Obfuscation:** 0.7 is consistent.\n- **Confidence:** 0.6 is acceptable.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- The code is benign; all reports correctly identify obfuscation but do not find malicious activity.\n- The malware scores are consistently 0 across all reports, which is justified.\n- Obfuscation scores are high (~0.6-0.7), reflecting the obfuscated name and unused imports.\n- Security risk scores are low, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should stay high (~0.6-0.7), given the obfuscated name and unused imports.\n- **Risk score:** Should be low (~0.2), as the code is trivial and benign.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.7 (to reflect obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (low security risk)\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis, confirming that the code is obfuscated but not malicious.",
