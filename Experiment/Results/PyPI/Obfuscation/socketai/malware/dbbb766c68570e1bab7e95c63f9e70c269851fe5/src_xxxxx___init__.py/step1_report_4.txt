{
  "purpose": "The code defines a simple function that increments its input by 2 and imports a module named 'add'.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only imports a module and defines a function.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or perform actions with potential security implications.",
  "flows": "The function takes an input and returns the input plus 2; no external data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "The imported module 'add' could be suspicious, but without its content, this cannot be determined. The function name 'EOCKpZFXqcfcOBILpSjALSfAevduNlbP' appears obfuscated, which may suggest intent to hide behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a local module and defines an obfuscated function that performs a simple addition. No external data handling, network activity, or suspicious operations are present. The import statement alone is harmless, but the obfuscated function name and module import could be part of an obfuscation tactic. Due to lack of additional context, there is no clear malicious behavior, but the obfuscation and module import are noteworthy.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign in isolation; it performs a trivial operation and imports a module. However, the obfuscated function name and module import warrant caution if the imported module is malicious or if further context reveals hidden behavior.",
