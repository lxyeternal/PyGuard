  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All reports agree that the code performs a simple addition: `x + 2`.\n- The function name is obfuscated (`EOCKpZFXqcfcOBILpSjALSfAevduNlbP`), which is suspicious but not necessarily malicious.\n- The code imports `os` and a local module `add`, neither of which are used, which could be an attempt at obfuscation or incomplete code.\n- No external data sources, sinks, network activity, or malicious operations are detected.\n- Confidence levels range from 0.4 to 0.7, with some suspicion due to obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The core functionality is benign: simple addition.\n- Obfuscated function name and unused imports are consistent across reports, which could be an attempt to hide intent.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based solely on this snippet.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:\n- No errors in reasoning; all reports correctly identify the benign nature but note obfuscation and unused imports.\n- The reports appropriately avoid assuming malicious intent solely based on obfuscation.\n\n### Score Review and Justifications:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.0, which is reasonable given the absence of malicious actions.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Ranges from 0.5 to 0.7; consistent with the obfuscated function name and unused imports.\n- **Security risk score:** Low (0.1 to 0.2), appropriate given the benign behavior.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The **risk score** could be slightly increased if the obfuscation is considered a red flag, but given the benign code, staying at 0.2 seems reasonable.\n- The **malware score** should remain at 0, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- The **obfuscated score** might be increased slightly if further context suggests concealment tactics, but current levels seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0.0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0.7** (consistent with obfuscated naming and unused imports)\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** (low but noting obfuscation; no immediate threat)\n\n**Overall, the code appears benign but employs obfuscation tactics that warrant cautious monitoring if part of a larger codebase.**",
