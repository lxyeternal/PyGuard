{
  "purpose": "The function appears to perform a simple arithmetic operation, adding 2 to its input.",
  "sources": "None explicitly present; no input/output operations or data reading detected.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no data leak points or external data usage observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is straightforward and self-contained.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of an obfuscated function name and import statement; the import may be unused. The function name is nonsensical, which could indicate obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'os' but does not use it, which might be an attempt to mislead or obfuscate. It also imports a local module 'add' which is unused in this snippet. The function 'EOCKpZFXqcfcOBILpSjALSfAevduNlbP' is a simple addition function with a meaningless name, possibly obfuscated. No malicious operations, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications, are present. The code's structure and content do not indicate malicious intent but suggest obfuscation or concealment tactics.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit malicious behavior based on the provided snippet. It appears to be a simple, benign function with obfuscated naming and unused imports, which could be intended to conceal its purpose but does not perform any harmful actions.",
