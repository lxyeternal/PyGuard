{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a simple function that adds 2 to its input, potentially as part of a larger module or obfuscated code.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the 'os' module import and a relative import 'add'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or data outputs are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Input to the function 'EOCKpZFXqcfcOBILpSjALSfAevduNlbP' flows to the return statement where 2 is added to the input.",
  "anomalies": "The function name is obfuscated; the import 'add' is not used within this snippet, which might suggest obfuscation or incomplete code. The purpose of the import and the function is unclear, but no malicious activity such as data exfiltration or network activity is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'os' module and a relative module 'add', neither of which is used within the provided snippet, indicating potential obfuscation or incomplete code. The function name is non-descriptive and obfuscated. The function simply adds 2 to its input, which alone is benign. No suspicious code flows, data leaks, or malicious actions are detected in this limited fragment. There are no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be benign with no malicious behavior or security risks evident from the provided snippet. The obfuscated naming suggests possible hiding of intent, but functionally, it only performs a simple addition.",
