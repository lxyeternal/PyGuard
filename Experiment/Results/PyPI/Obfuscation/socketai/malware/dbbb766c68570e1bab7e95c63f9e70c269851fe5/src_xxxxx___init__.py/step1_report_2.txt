{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a simple function that adds 2 to its input; it may be part of a larger module.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'os' module and a local module 'add'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data is used in a risky way are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The function 'EOCKpZFXqcfcOBILpSjALSfAevduNlbP' takes an input 'x' and returns 'x+2', but no untrusted data sources are utilized in the code.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual aspects include the function name 'EOCKpZFXqcfcOBILpSjALSfAevduNlbP', which appears obfuscated or randomly generated, and the import of 'os' and 'add' modules without using them.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'os' module and a local 'add' module but does not use them within the snippet. The function name is non-descriptive and appears obfuscated, which could be suspicious in some contexts but may also be just stylistic. There are no evident malicious behaviors, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or execution of untrusted code. The function performs a simple arithmetic operation, adding 2 to its input. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic are apparent. The presence of unused imports and an obfuscated function name might indicate an attempt to hide intent but does not directly suggest malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal and appears benign, mainly performing a simple addition. The obfuscated function name and unused imports are unusual but not inherently malicious. There is no evidence of malware or security risks based solely on this snippet.",
