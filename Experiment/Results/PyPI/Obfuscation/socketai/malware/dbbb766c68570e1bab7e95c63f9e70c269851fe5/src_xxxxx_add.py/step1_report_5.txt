{
  "purpose": "The code defines a simple function that increments a number by one.",
  "sources": "No explicit input sources; the function takes an argument 'number'. The only import is 'os', which is not used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not perform any data output, network communication, or file operations.",
  "flows": "The function receives a number and returns the incremented value. No external data flow occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The imported 'os' module is not used, which is unusual but not malicious. The function name appears obfuscated, but the code itself is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, defining a function with an obfuscated name that adds 1 to its input. There are no data leaks, network activity, or suspicious behaviors. The unused import 'os' may suggest an attempt to evade detection or obfuscate intent, but alone it is not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no signs of malicious activity. The obfuscated function name is a mild anomaly but does not indicate harm. Overall, this appears to be simple, non-malicious code with no security risks.",
