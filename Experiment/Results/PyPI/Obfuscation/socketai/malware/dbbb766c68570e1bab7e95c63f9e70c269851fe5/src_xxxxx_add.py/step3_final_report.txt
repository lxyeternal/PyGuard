  "purpose": "A trivial function that increments a number by 1.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'number'. No external data sources or inputs.",
  "sinks": "Return value; no data leaks or external outputs.",
  "flows": "Input 'number' flows directly to the return statement with no external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function name; unused 'os' import; no external data or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple increment function with an obfuscated name and an unused import. No malicious code, network activity, or data leaks are present. The obfuscated name and unused import are superficial anomalies, not indicators of malicious intent. The code's benign nature is confirmed by multiple consistent reviews. Scores reflect the superficial obfuscation but no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with superficial obfuscation tactics. No malicious activity or security risks are present. The current malware score of 0 and low security risk score are appropriate. Obfuscation score could be slightly increased to reflect the function name's obscurity, but current scores are reasonable.",
