{
  "purpose": "The code defines a simple function that increments a number by 1.",
  "sources": "The function takes an input parameter 'number', which could be considered an input source if invoked with external data.",
  "sinks": "The function outputs the incremented value; no external sinks or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Input 'number' flows into the function, which then returns 'number + 1'. There are no external data flows or network connections.",
  "anomalies": "The function name appears obfuscated and meaningless, which could be a sign of hiding intent. However, the function itself is trivial and does not perform any suspicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'os' module but does not use it. The function 'knWKhGGKmtVXdnTFKRguIgIIycBcNKkM' simply increments its input by one and returns it. No other logic, data handling, or external interactions are present. The obfuscated function name might suggest an attempt to conceal purpose, but the function's logic is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, trivial function with no malicious behavior. The obfuscated function name alone is not sufficient to determine malicious intent. No security issues or malware indicators are evident.",
