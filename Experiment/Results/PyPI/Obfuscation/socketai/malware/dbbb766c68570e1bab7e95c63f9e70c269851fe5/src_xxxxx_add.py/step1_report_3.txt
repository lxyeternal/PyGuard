{
  "purpose": "The code defines a simple function that increments a given number by one.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only uses the function parameter.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "The function takes a parameter and returns its incremented value, with no external data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of an imported os module that is never used, and a function with an obfuscated or nonsensical name. The code is minimal and contains no malicious behavior or hidden functionality.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the os module but does not use it, indicating potential leftover or placeholder code. The function 'knWKhGGKmtVXdnTFKRguIgIIycBcNKkM' is highly obfuscated in name but performs a simple addition. There are no external data reads, no sinks, no network calls, or other suspicious operations. Overall, the code appears benign, simple, and non-malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward function with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The presence of an unused import and an obfuscated function name suggests minimal complexity but no security concerns.",
