      "conclusion": "The code contains explicit malicious behavior involving data exfiltration of sensitive system information to an external server. The obfuscated function names and the execution of a complex shell command with 'shell=True' further support malicious intent. The activity is high severity, and the package should be flagged for review or removal."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign, with superficial obfuscation tactics. No malicious activity or security risks are present. The current malware score of 0 and low security risk score are appropriate. Obfuscation score could be slightly increased to reflect the function name's obscurity, but current scores are reasonable."
