  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a basic utility or script that performs data processing or system interaction, but the exact intent is unclear due to the lack of comments and context.",
  "sources": "Code reads input from environment variables, function parameters, and potentially files or network sources (if present in the omitted parts).",
  "sinks": "Data may flow into print statements, network requests, or file writes, depending on omitted code. Specific sinks cannot be confirmed without full code context.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources like environment variables or input functions to sinks such as output functions or network communication (if present).",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies like hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are visible in the provided snippet. The code structure appears straightforward. However, without full code, some anomalies cannot be definitively ruled out.",
  "analysis": "Step-by-step analysis indicates the code contains typical input/output handling and possibly standard library usage. No signs of malicious obfuscation or suspicious behavior such as dynamic code execution, secret exfiltration, or network connections to suspicious domains are evident. The code's intent is generic and lacks specific malicious indicators. Due to incomplete context, some risk elements may not be detected.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there is no clear evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, but incomplete context prevents a comprehensive assessment. No suspicious or malicious patterns are detected in the examined snippet.",
