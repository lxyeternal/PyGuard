  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code input, external modules, dynamic execution points ('exec', 'eval'), environment variables, network calls.",
  "sinks": "Potential data exfiltration points, network connections, file modifications, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input or environment variables flow into dynamic execution or network transmission sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation, dynamic code execution ('exec', 'eval'), hardcoded suspicious patterns, inconsistent code structure.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits no malicious activity in reports 1, 2, 3, and 5, with low obfuscation and low security risk scores (0.2). Report 4 indicates obfuscation (0.7), dynamic execution ('exec', 'eval'), and suspicious patterns, leading to moderate suspicion (malware score 0.4, security risk 0.6). The scores are consistent with the described behaviors, with no confirmed malicious payloads. The overall assessment suggests benign code with some suspicion in report 4 due to obfuscation and dynamic code features.",
  "conclusion": "Most code is benign with low security risk; report 4 shows moderate suspicion due to obfuscation and dynamic execution but lacks confirmed malicious payloads. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. Slightly increasing malware suspicion in report 4 could be considered, but current scores are justified.",
