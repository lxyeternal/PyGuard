  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be a standard Python module performing some typical operations, possibly related to data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input functions, environment variables, or imported modules. Specific source points include any input() calls, reading files, or environment variables, if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, subprocess executions, file writes/deletions, or any system commands that could be exploited for malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as input or environment variables to sinks such as system commands or network requests, if these are present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, such as obfuscated code, hidden dynamic executions, or hardcoded secrets, are detected. No backdoors or suspicious logic identified.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be straightforward, utilizing standard Python features and libraries. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The code structure and variable naming are consistent with benign use. There are no indications of code injection, malicious payloads, or unsafe operations. However, a thorough review of imported modules or external data sources is limited due to lack of context.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears benign, with no suspicious behaviors detected.",
