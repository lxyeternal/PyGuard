  "security_risk": 0.4,
  "obfuscated": 0.7,
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "conclusion": "Most code is benign with low security risk; report 4 shows moderate suspicion due to obfuscation and dynamic execution but lacks confirmed malicious payloads. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. Slightly increasing malware suspicion in report 4 could be considered, but current scores are justified."
