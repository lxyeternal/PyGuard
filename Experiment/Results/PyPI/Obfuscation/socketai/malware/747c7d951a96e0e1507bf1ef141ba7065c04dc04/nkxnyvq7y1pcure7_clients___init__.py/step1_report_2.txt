{
  "purpose": "The code appears to initialize a web server and handle incoming HTTP requests, potentially for data processing or API purposes.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from network sockets via HTTP requests. No other input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "Data from requests is processed or possibly sent to external services; specific sinks are not explicitly shown but could involve data output, logs, or network calls.",
  "flows": "Input from HTTP request -> processing functions -> output or external communication",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or sensitive data found; no suspicious URL or domain usage; code appears straightforward with standard library functions. No obfuscated code or unusual language features detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a basic HTTP server, handles requests, and processes data accordingly. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or system modification is evident. The code structure and function usage are typical for web server applications. There are no signs of backdoors, hidden behaviors, or malicious network activity. The overall design suggests a benign utility script.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code appears to be a standard implementation of a simple web server. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based on the provided code segment. The risk level is low.",
