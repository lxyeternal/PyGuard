  "conclusion": "The code is generally benign with no confirmed malicious activity. However, the use of eval/exec functions introduces a moderate security concern, especially if untrusted input is involved. The overall malware score should be increased for this reason, and the risk score adjusted accordingly to reflect the potential danger of dynamic code execution. Vigilance and further manual review are recommended for such features."
