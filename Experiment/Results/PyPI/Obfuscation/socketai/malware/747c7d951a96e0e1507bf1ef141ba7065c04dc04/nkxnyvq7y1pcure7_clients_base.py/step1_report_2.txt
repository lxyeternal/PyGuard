  "purpose": "Defines an abstract base class for sending events with validation and logging.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to __init__ and send_event methods, especially event_type, timestamp, event_data.",
  "sinks": "Logging calls, especially self.logger.debug, and the abstract method _send_event which would be implemented elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow through validation and into the _send_event method; logging occurs with event details.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code execution, no network activity, no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard abstract class for event handling with proper validation and logging. It ensures 'event_type' is a non-empty string, 'timestamp' is UTC and naive, and logs event details before delegating to an implementation-specific _send_event method. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data flows are evident. The use of logging is standard and does not leak data on its own. No external network connections, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign, well-structured abstract class for event processing with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
