{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for sending events with validation and logging",
  "sources": "Constructor parameters (event_type, timeout, logger), send_event method parameters (event_data, event_type, timestamp, timeout, logger)",
  "targets": "Logging calls (logger.debug), the abstract method _send_event",
  "flows": "Initialization via constructor, send_event method flow from input validation to logging and calling _send_event",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious data leaks, no obfuscated code, no malicious behaviors observed",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a base class with validation for event types and timestamps, uses standard logging, and defines an abstract method for event sending. No data exfiltration, network communication, or malicious code is present. The structure appears to be for a legitimate event dispatching system. No signs of backdoors, hidden code, or malicious payloads are identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a clean, standard abstract class for event handling with validation and logging. It contains no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a safe component for a larger system.",
