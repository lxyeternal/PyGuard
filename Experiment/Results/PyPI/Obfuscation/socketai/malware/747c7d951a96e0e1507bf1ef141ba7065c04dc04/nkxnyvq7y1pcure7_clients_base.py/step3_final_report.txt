{
  "purpose": "Defines an abstract base class for event dispatching with validation and logging.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as event_type, timestamp, event_data, and optional logger",
  "sinks": "Logging outputs; no external network or data exfiltration observed",
  "flows": "Input parameters are validated, then logged, then passed to the abstract _send_event method",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; standard validation and logging",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured abstract class for sending events. It performs input validation on event_type and timestamp, uses logging for debugging, and delegates actual event sending to an abstract method. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to potential misuse if subclassed maliciously, but the code itself is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation of an abstract event client class with no malicious or security issues. The minor security risk score of 0.1 in some reports is a conservative estimate considering the abstract nature, but the code itself is secure.",
