  "flows": "Input parameters (event_type, timestamp, event_data, timeout, logger) -> send_event method -> _send_event method",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. The code performs validation and logging without any external data transmission or data leakage mechanisms.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class with methods for validating event types and timestamps, logging event information, and an abstract method for sending events. No user input is directly used insecurely, and no data leaks or malicious behaviors are evident. The use of the logging module is standard, and there are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code. The validation methods prevent malformed data. The flow is straightforward and does not include any suspicious external connections or data exfiltration routines.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, well-structured abstract base class for event handling with proper validation and logging. There are no indicators of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It relies on subclasses to implement the actual event transmission logic, which must be reviewed separately for security risks.",
