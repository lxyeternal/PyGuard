  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility function, but the specific intent is unclear without further context.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables and potentially from imported modules, but no explicit external input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, file writes, or system commands if present in the code, but none are explicitly identified here.",
  "flows": "Data flow pathways are limited; there are no clear source-to-sink flows indicating malicious data exfiltration or command execution.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are observed. The code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code was carefully reviewed, examining imports, variable assignments, control flow, and function calls. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are detected. There are no indications of backdoors, data leaks, or malicious network activity. The code structure is standard, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with no suspicious patterns or anomalies detected.",
