  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script performing some data processing or utility functions, but the specific purpose cannot be determined without seeing the actual code content.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly visible; potential sources could include environment variables, files, or network inputs if present in the code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writing/reading, subprocess calls, or data transmission points, but none are explicitly identified without code details.",
  "flows": "Data flow pathways are unclear without specific code; typically, source data would flow into processing functions and then to sinks such as output or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or obfuscated patterns are detected from the provided information.",
  "analysis": "Due to the absence of actual code content, a detailed step-by-step analysis cannot be performed. The general structure appears standard, with no signs of malicious logic or suspicious patterns. No indications of code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors are observed based solely on the provided prompt.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the lack of code content, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, but a comprehensive review requires the actual code snippet to confirm this assessment.",
