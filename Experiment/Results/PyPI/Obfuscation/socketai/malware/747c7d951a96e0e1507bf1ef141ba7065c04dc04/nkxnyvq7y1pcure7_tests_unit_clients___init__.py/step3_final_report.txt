  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Reads from files, environment variables, user input; potential network connections; hardcoded IPs; use of 'exec' (if present).",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, file outputs, stdout, environment variables.",
  "flows": "Untrusted data flows from sources to sinks, possibly leading to data exfiltration or code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded IP addresses, potential use of 'exec', unvalidated input, network transmission of untrusted data.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits potential malicious indicators such as hardcoded network targets, unvalidated data handling, and possible code execution functions. These behaviors suggest a moderate to high suspicion of malicious intent, especially if 'exec' or similar functions are used on untrusted input. The presence of network activity with hardcoded IPs further elevates concern. The absence of obfuscation and benign structure in other parts indicates that malicious behavior, if present, is likely targeted or hidden within specific functions. The scores assigned (malware=0.5, securityRisk=0.75) reflect these suspicions, aligning with the described behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows moderate suspicion due to network activity, hardcoded IPs, and potential code execution points. While not definitively malicious, these indicators warrant caution. The scores are consistent with the evidence, with a malware score of 0.5 and a high security risk score of 0.75, appropriately reflecting the potential threat.",
