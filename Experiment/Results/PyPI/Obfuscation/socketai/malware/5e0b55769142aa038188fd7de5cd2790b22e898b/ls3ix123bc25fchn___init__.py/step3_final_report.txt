  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, file reads, network interactions, and data processing functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential network connections, file system modifications, environment variable access, and data outputs.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or network inputs flow into processing functions, with outputs potentially reaching network or file sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads detected; reports indicate straightforward code.",
  "analysis": "All reports consistently describe benign, straightforward code with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2) align with the descriptions. Confidence levels are high, reflecting the limited context but reasonable assessments. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are reported. The low security risk score is appropriate given the absence of concrete vulnerabilities or malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the reports, the code appears benign with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The scoring is consistent and justified. No adjustments are necessary; the overall security posture is minimal risk.",
