  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious behavior, primarily due to the silent, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed during setup. The pattern aligns with known tactics in supply chain attacks and backdoors. The high obfuscation, silent execution, and potential for malicious payloads justify assigning high malware and risk scores."
