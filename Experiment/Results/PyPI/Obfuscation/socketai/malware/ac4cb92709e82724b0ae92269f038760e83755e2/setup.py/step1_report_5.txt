The script suppresses errors with broad 'try-except' blocks, hiding potential issues.\",\n  \"analysis\": \"The script begins with importing 'setup' from 'distutils.core' for package setup purposes. It then attempts to check if a directory 'tahg' exists. If not, it executes a PowerShell command via 'subprocess.Popen'. The command is encoded in Base64, which is often used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The command runs silently ('-WindowStyle Hidden') and sets 'creationflags' to suppress window display. The entire execution is wrapped in 'try-except' blocks that suppress errors, making detection harder. The package setup code is straightforward, but the embedded PowerShell command is suspicious due to encoding, silent execution, and obfuscation. The second 'try-except' is a benign setup call, but the first contains potentially malicious behavior.',\n  \"conclusion\": \"The code contains suspicious behavior with obfuscated PowerShell command execution triggered conditionally, which could be used for malicious purposes such as code download, system modification, or data exfiltration. The broad exception handling masks errors, hiding potential malicious activity. Overall, there is a high likelihood of malicious intent due to the obfuscated payload and silent execution.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.8,\n  \"obfuscated\": 0.8,\n  \"malware\": 0.75,\n  \"securityRisk\": 0.8\n}",
