{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for data collection, including extracting passwords, cookies, browser history, system information, and potentially sensitive tokens from various applications and browsers, then sending this information to a remote webhook and uploading data to transfer.sh. It also includes modules for process monitoring and environmental checks.",
  "sources": "The code reads user environment variables, system registry, local files for browsers, wallet applications, and other software data. It also captures clipboard data, takes screenshots, and interacts with system processes.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows include requests to a remote webhook URL (https://kekwltd.ru/relay), uploads to transfer.sh, file creation/modification for storing credentials and cookies, and process termination commands. The code also reads sensitive data from browsers and wallets, then transmits or saves it.",
  "flows": "System environment and registry data are used as sources. Extracted credentials, tokens, cookies, and system info are sent to the webhook and uploaded to external servers. There are process-killing routines that can terminate security or analysis tools. Files and data are read, decrypted, and transmitted without user consent.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded webhook URL and multiple obfuscated or suspicious variable names. The code automatically terminates security tools (like process kill for 'procc' and checking for process names). It manipulates browser data, cookies, and wallet files. It creates and uploads ZIP archives of collected data. Some functions appear to perform environment checks or environmental sabotage. There are signs of data exfiltration, persistence setup (startup copy), and stealthy operations. The use of threading for concurrent data collection, and the inclusion of various browser and wallet paths, strongly suggest malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script performs extensive data collection, including system info, browser credentials, cookies, wallet details, and clipboard data. It decrypts stored passwords and cookies from browsers, extracts wallet info from specific directories, and takes system screenshots. It interacts with system registry and environment variables to gather hardware and network info. It terminates security processes and disables or modifies some configurations possibly to avoid detection. Data is compressed into ZIP files and sent to an external webhook URL, with some data written in structured formats. Obfuscated or misleading function and variable names, along with the inclusion of payloads like process termination and environment checks, indicate malicious behavior. The code is clearly designed for covert data theft and system manipulation, characteristic of malware targeting victim privacy and system integrity.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious intent through its comprehensive data exfiltration routines, environment manipulation, and stealth features. It collects sensitive user data from browsers, wallets, and system info, then transmits this data to a remote server. It also terminates security processes to hinder detection. The presence of hardcoded URLs, environment checks, and process termination routines confirm it is malware aimed at system compromise and data theft.",
