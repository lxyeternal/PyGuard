{
  "purpose": "The code is designed for extensive data theft and system sabotage, including credential harvesting, cookie extraction, token collection, system info gathering, clipboard monitoring, process termination, and persistence mechanisms. It exfiltrates data via webhooks and uploads.",
  "sources": "Browsers' local storage files, registry, environment variables, clipboard, wallet directories, system info files, and user directories.",
  "sinks": "Sends data to a hardcoded webhook, uploads ZIP archives to transfer.sh, writes/deletes files stealthily, and terminates security or analysis processes.",
  "flows": "Data is collected from local files, decrypted if necessary, then transmitted via network requests or uploaded, with process termination routines and persistence setups to evade detection.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names, encrypted payload routines, hardcoded URLs, process-killing routines targeting security tools, and stealthy file operations indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code performs credential and token extraction, system info collection, clipboard monitoring, process termination, and data exfiltration. It employs encryption/decryption routines, obfuscation, and persistence tactics. The hardcoded webhook URL and stealth operations confirm malicious behavior. The code's structure and routines are characteristic of malware designed for privacy invasion, data theft, and system sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is unequivocally malicious malware, performing credential theft, data exfiltration, process sabotage, and stealth operations. The high malware score (1), high security risk (1), and obfuscation level (around 0.75-0.9) are justified based on its behavior and techniques.",
