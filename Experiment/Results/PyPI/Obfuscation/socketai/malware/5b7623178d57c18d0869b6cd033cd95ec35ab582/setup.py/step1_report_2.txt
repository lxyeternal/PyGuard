{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be for setting up a Python package, with additional code that may execute a hidden PowerShell command.",
  "sources": "The code reads the filesystem to check for the existence of 'tahg' and potentially executes a subprocess if it does not exist.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen call executes a PowerShell command with encoded content, which could be malicious if the encoded command is harmful.",
  "flows": "If 'tahg' does not exist, the code triggers subprocess to run a hidden PowerShell command, which could perform arbitrary actions.",
  "anomalies": "The encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated, making it suspicious. It runs asynchronously without clear purpose. The code suppresses exceptions silently. The setup function is standard, but the preceding code behavior is unusual.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with importing setup from distutils, then checks for the existence of 'tahg'. If missing, it runs a hidden PowerShell command encoded in base64, which is often used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The command runs asynchronously, with no apparent verification or logging. The setup call appears normal but is enclosed in a try-except that suppresses errors. The combination of filesystem checks, encoded command execution, and silent error handling indicates a potentially malicious attempt to run hidden code during package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains suspicious behavior primarily due to the execution of an encoded PowerShell command in a hidden window when a specific file does not exist. This pattern is commonly associated with malicious payloads or backdoor setups. The rest of the setup code appears benign, but the hidden execution warrants suspicion and further analysis.",
