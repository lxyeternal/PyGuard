{
  "purpose": "The code attempts to set up a Python package and conditionally executes a hidden PowerShell command, potentially for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads the file system to check for 'tahg' directory; executes a subprocess with encoded PowerShell command.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess invocation executing hidden PowerShell command with encoded content.",
  "flows": "Checks for 'tahg' directory -> if not exists, runs encoded PowerShell command via subprocess.",
  "anomalies": "Use of encoded PowerShell command intended to run hidden; lack of error handling details; broad exception catching; suspicious command execution pattern. The PowerShell command is encoded, which is often used to obfuscate malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by importing 'setup' from distutils.core. It then attempts to check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg'. If this directory does not exist, it executes a subprocess running a PowerShell command encoded in Base64. The command is run with hidden window style and with creation flags that suppress window display, which is typical of malicious obfuscation. The use of try-except blocks with broad exception handling conceals errors and prevents the user from noticing failures. The setup function defines package metadata, which appears benign, but the embedded PowerShell command raises suspicion due to its obfuscation and hidden execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains suspicious behavior through the encoded PowerShell command executed silently, which could be used for malicious activities such as downloading or executing malicious payloads. The overall structure and obfuscation strongly suggest malicious intent or at least covert malicious behavior.",
