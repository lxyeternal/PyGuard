  "conclusion": "The script functions as a covert data exfiltration tool, leveraging obfuscation and hardcoded credentials to upload files to Telegram. While it lacks active payloads like system damage or reverse shells, its behavior aligns with malicious exfiltration malware. The high scores for malware (around 0.85), obfuscation (around 0.85), and security risk (around 0.9) are justified given its potential for unauthorized data theft."
