      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. The existing reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware and obfuscation scores of 0. The minor security risk score of 0.1 due to the unprofessional description is acceptable but could be adjusted to 0 for consistency. Overall, the code is safe, and the reports are accurate."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The script functions as a covert data exfiltration tool, leveraging obfuscation and hardcoded credentials to upload files to Telegram. While it lacks active payloads like system damage or reverse shells, its behavior aligns with malicious exfiltration malware. The high scores for malware (around 0.85), obfuscation (around 0.85), and security risk (around 0.9) are justified given its potential for unauthorized data theft."
