  "purpose": "Minimal setup script defining package metadata with a static call to setup()",
  "sources": "No external inputs; static parameters in setup() call",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows; no data leaks or external effects",
  "flows": "N/A - static code with no data flow",
  "anomalies": "Package name 'pfnjltrk5zsrbpnv' appears as a random or obfuscated string; license field is empty",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static setup script importing setuptools and calling setup() with fixed parameters. The package name is unusual and appears obfuscated, which could be suspicious but does not indicate malicious activity. No external data, network activity, or code injection is present. The license field being empty is atypical but not malicious. Malware and malicious behavior are not evident. The obfuscation score could be moderate due to the package name, but the code itself is benign. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to the suspicious package name. Overall, the code is benign, with a slight concern about the naming pattern, but no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal, benign setup script with an obfuscated package name. No malicious behavior or malicious code is detected. The package name's randomness warrants caution if distributed, but based solely on this code snippet, the risk is minimal.",
