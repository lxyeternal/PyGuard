  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to stealthy, obfuscated PowerShell execution triggered during setup. While the exact payload remains unknown, the behavior aligns with typical malware or backdoor tactics. The scores assigned reflect significant security concerns, and the code should be treated as potentially malicious until further analysis confirms otherwise."
