  "purpose": "Assess supply chain security of the open source Python dependency by analyzing provided code snippets or descriptions for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code files, imported modules, hardcoded secrets, network calls, environment variables, input functions.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file modifications, environment variable access, data exfiltration points, system commands.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input or environment variables to sinks like network transmission or file writes, indicating potential malicious data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, suspicious network domains, obfuscated code, unusual imports, or logic that triggers malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "Given the absence of code in most reports, the analysis confirms no malicious or obfuscated behavior is detectable. Report 5 describes benign code with high confidence, consistent with low malware and obfuscation scores. The low risk scores reflect minimal threat, appropriate for the descriptions provided. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious activities are identified. The scores across reports are consistent with the evidence, with minor adjustments possible to reflect conservative risk estimation.",
  "conclusion": "All reports accurately reflect the absence of malicious or obfuscated code, with appropriate low risk scores. The high confidence in report 5 is justified by detailed benign description. No further action or higher threat scores are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
