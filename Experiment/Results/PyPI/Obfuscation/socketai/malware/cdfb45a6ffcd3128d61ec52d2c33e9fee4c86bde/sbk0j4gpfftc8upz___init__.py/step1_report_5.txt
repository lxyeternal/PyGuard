  "purpose": "The code appears to be a Python package designed to perform data processing or utility functions, with no explicit purpose evident from the snippet provided.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are not explicitly visible; potential sources could include environment variables, function arguments, or file reads, but none are explicitly shown in the snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or system calls, but none are explicitly present in the provided code.",
  "flows": "No clear source-to-sink data flows are identifiable due to the lack of input or output operations in the snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are observed. The code structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard Python functions with common library usage, no suspicious imports, and no signs of obfuscation or malicious patterns. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or data exfiltration attempts. The logic is simple, and there are no network or system modification commands. Without additional context or code sections, there are no indications of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code appears benign, standard, and non-malicious.",
