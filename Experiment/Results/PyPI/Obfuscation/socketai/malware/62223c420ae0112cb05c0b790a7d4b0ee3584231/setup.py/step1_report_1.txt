  "purpose": "Customize the install process to collect system information and exfiltrate sensitive files to remote servers.",
  "sources": "Socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser(), opening of '/etc/passwd' and '/etc/shadow'",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URLs ('https://j0j0.xyz/11cent', 'http://' + hostname + ... , 'https://j0j0.xyz/', 'https://j0j0.xyz/etc/') with data from sensitive files and system info",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, cwd, username) sent via GET requests; contents of '/etc/passwd' and '/etc/shadow' sent via POST requests to remote server",
  "anomalies": "Requests include exfiltration of sensitive system files; use of hardcoded URLs; sending of system information without user consent; reading '/etc/shadow' and '/etc/passwd' which are sensitive files; obfuscated class and method names",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class inheriting from 'install' that overrides its method to collect system hostname, current directory, and username. It then sends this info to a suspicious domain. Additionally, it reads sensitive system files ('/etc/passwd' and '/etc/shadow') and posts their contents to a remote server. The use of obfuscated class and method names suggests an attempt to conceal malicious intent. The exfiltration of sensitive data and communication with suspicious domains are clear indicators of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious, performing data exfiltration of system information and sensitive files to external domains, indicative of malicious activity. The obfuscation and direct file access support the conclusion that this is malicious malware designed for unauthorized data theft.",
