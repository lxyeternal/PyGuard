  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to gather system information and exfiltrate sensitive files to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Reading hostname (socket.gethostname()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), username (getpass.getuser()), and reading files '/etc/passwd' and '/etc/shadow'.",
  "sinks": "Sending collected data via POST requests to 'https://j0j0.xyz/' and 'https://j0j0.xyz/etc/', and making GET requests to specific URLs with system info as parameters.",
  "flows": "Collects hostname, cwd, username → sends data via requests.post and requests.get to remote server; reads sensitive files ('/etc/passwd' and '/etc/shadow') → exfiltrates via requests.post.",
  "anomalies": "Uses obfuscated class and method names, makes unsolicited network requests to suspicious domains, reads sensitive system files and transmits them, unusual use of requests to send data without clear legitimate purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom setup command that, during installation, gathers hostname, username, and current directory. It then makes multiple requests to a suspicious domain, including sending the contents of '/etc/passwd' and '/etc/shadow', which are highly sensitive files. These actions strongly suggest data exfiltration, likely malicious. The obfuscated naming and network activity point toward malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be malicious, performing data collection and exfiltration of sensitive system files to a remote server during installation. It is highly suspicious and potentially harmful.",
