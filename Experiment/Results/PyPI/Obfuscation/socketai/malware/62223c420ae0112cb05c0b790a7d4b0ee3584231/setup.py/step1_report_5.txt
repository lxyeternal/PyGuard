{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom installation script that collects system information and transmits it to an external server, potentially for malicious purposes such as data exfiltration or backdoor setup.",
  "sources": "The code reads system hostname, current working directory, username, and sensitive files (/etc/passwd and /etc/shadow).",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URLs ('https://j0j0.xyz', 'http://11cent.j0j0.xyz', 'https://j0j0.xyz/etc/') and POST requests with contents of sensitive system files.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, cwd, username) is sent via GET requests to multiple domains. Sensitive files are read and their content posted to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual and suspicious network activity: sending system data and sensitive files to external untrusted domains. Usage of hardcoded URLs and reading of protected system files without clear purpose. The code employs obfuscated class and variable names, which may suggest concealment.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a subclass of setuptools.install, overriding the installation process. During installation, it gathers hostname, current working directory, and username. It then makes multiple GET requests to a suspicious domain, transmitting this info. Additionally, it reads /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow' and posts their contents to an external server. This behavior indicates potential data exfiltration or backdoor activity. The obfuscated class and variable names, combined with the network activity targeting external domains with sensitive data, point toward malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior, including unauthorized data collection and exfiltration of sensitive system files to untrusted external servers. The obfuscated naming and network activity strongly suggest malicious intent. It should be considered high risk and avoided.",
