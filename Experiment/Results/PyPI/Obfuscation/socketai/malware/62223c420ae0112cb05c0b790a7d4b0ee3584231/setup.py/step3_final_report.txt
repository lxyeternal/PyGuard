{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to exfiltrate system information and sensitive files during package installation, communicating with suspicious external domains.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser(), reading /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow files.",
  "sinks": "HTTP GET and POST requests to external domains ('https://j0j0.xyz', '11cent.j0j0.xyz', etc.), transmitting system info and file contents.",
  "flows": "Data from system info and sensitive files are collected and sent via network requests to external servers, including reading files and transmitting their contents.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names, reading and transmitting sensitive system files (/etc/passwd, /etc/shadow), multiple requests to suspicious domains, use of hardcoded URLs.",
  "analysis": "The code performs malicious activities: it collects system info and sensitive files during installation, then exfiltrates this data to external servers. The obfuscation and network activity are typical indicators of malicious intent. The network requests include transmitting file contents, which is a clear data theft behavior. The code's behavior aligns with known malicious patterns, and the use of obfuscation further supports this. The scores assigned in the reports—malware score of 1, high security risk, and obfuscation—are justified given the evidence.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits definitive malicious behavior, including unauthorized data exfiltration of sensitive system files and info, with obfuscation and suspicious network activity. It should be classified as malware with the highest severity scores.",
