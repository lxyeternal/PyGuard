  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to collect system information and exfiltrate sensitive files.",
  "sources": "Socket hostname, current working directory, username, files '/etc/passwd' and '/etc/shadow'.",
  "sinks": "Multiple HTTP GET requests to external domains, POST requests uploading '/etc/passwd' and '/etc/shadow' contents.",
  "flows": "Data from hostname, cwd, username, and sensitive files are sent via HTTP requests to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "The code retrieves and sends sensitive system files ('/etc/passwd' and '/etc/shadow') without user consent; uses obfuscated class and method names; multiple requests to potentially malicious domains; attempts to exfiltrate system info and files.",
  "analysis": "The code redefines the install command to include additional actions during package installation. It collects system info (hostname, current directory, username) and makes several HTTP GET requests to external domains, including dynamically constructed URLs. It also reads sensitive files ('/etc/passwd' and '/etc/shadow') and posts their contents to external URLs. These behaviors suggest data exfiltration of sensitive system information and files without user consent. The obfuscated class/method names and multiple network requests to suspicious domains are typical of malicious payloads aiming to compromise or spy on the system. The code does not contain any apparent benign purpose for such actions, indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior aimed at exfiltrating system information and sensitive files without user consent, indicating high likelihood of malicious intent. It should be considered dangerous and should not be used.",
