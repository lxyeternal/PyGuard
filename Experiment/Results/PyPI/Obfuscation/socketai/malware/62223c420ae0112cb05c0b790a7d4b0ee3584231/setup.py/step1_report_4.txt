  "purpose": "Custom setup script that extends the installation process to perform additional actions during package installation.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser(), reading /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow files",
  "sinks": "requests.get() and requests.post() functions used to send data to external domains",
  "flows": "Hostname, username, and current directory data are sent via GET requests; contents of /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow are sent via POST requests to external servers",
  "anomalies": "Code fetches sensitive system files (/etc/passwd, /etc/shadow) and transmits their contents without authorization; the domain j0j0.xyz is suspicious and possibly malicious; requests to dynamically constructed URLs; obfuscated class and method names",
  "analysis": "The code extends the standard setuptools installation by defining a custom install class. During installation, it gathers system information such as hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via GET requests to a suspicious domain. It also reads sensitive system files /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow, which are then POSTed to the same or similar external endpoint. The use of hardcoded URLs, sending sensitive data, and obfuscated naming indicate malicious intent. The code appears designed to exfiltrate system information and sensitive credentials during installation, which constitutes malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting and exfiltrating sensitive system data during installation. It connects to suspicious domains and transmits system and credential data, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent. This package should be considered dangerous and avoided.",
