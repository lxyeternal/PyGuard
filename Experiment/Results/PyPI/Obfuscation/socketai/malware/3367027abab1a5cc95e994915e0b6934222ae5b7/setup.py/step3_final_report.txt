  "purpose": "A minimal setup script defining package metadata with a seemingly obfuscated package name.",
  "sources": "Static data in setup() parameters: name, version, license, authors, keywords.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data flows; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "None; static metadata without dynamic input or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual, obfuscated-looking package name 'h486rhk7if5lrn1g'.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static setup script with no dynamic code, input handling, or network activity. The package name appears obfuscated but does not indicate malicious intent by itself. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with the main concern being the obfuscated name. Malware is not present; the obfuscation score is moderate (~0.3), reflecting suspicion of the name but no active malicious behavior. The overall security risk remains low (~0.2).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with an obfuscated package name. No malicious activity is evident. The obfuscated name warrants cautious monitoring in a broader context but does not constitute malware or a significant security threat in isolation.",
