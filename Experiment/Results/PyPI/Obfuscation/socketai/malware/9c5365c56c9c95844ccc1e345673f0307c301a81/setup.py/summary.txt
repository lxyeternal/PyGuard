  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior through covert data exfiltration during package installation, with obfuscation and suspicious network activity. The activity is consistent with supply chain attack tactics. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with high malware and risk levels justified by the exfiltration and obfuscation. The overall assessment indicates a high-security threat, and the package should be considered malicious or highly suspicious."
