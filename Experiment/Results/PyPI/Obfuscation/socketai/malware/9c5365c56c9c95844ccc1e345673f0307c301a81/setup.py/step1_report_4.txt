{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a setup configuration for a Python package, including custom installation behavior that performs network requests and writes to files.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the filesystem (README.md, pocbykotko.txt), the network (requests.get to api.ipify.org and kotko.org), and environment details (os.uname()).",
  "sinks": "The network requests send data to external URLs. File writing occurs to 'pocbykotko.txt'. Environment info is gathered and encoded but not directly stored or transmitted within the visible code.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves gathering system and network info during the install process, encoding and sending data via HTTP GET requests, and writing proof text to a file. Data from system and network is collected and transmitted to external servers during setup.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual activities include network communication during package installation, writing a proof string to a file, and sending system and IP info encoded in base64 to a potentially suspicious domain ('kotko.org'). The code registers a function to execute on exit that performs these actions, which is atypical for standard package setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setup functions but introduces a custom install class that registers a cleanup function executed upon installation completion. This function collects system information, encodes it, and transmits it to an external domain, which is suspicious. The code writes a text proof file during exit, which could be a placeholder or a covert marker. The network calls do not involve user input or obvious parameters, but the collection and transmission of system and IP data without user consent indicate malicious intent or at least suspicious activity. No hardcoded credentials are evident, but the hidden network communication and data exfiltration are notable concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious-like behavior: it collects system and IP info and transmits it to a remote server during package installation, which is unusual and potentially malicious. The use of exit registration to perform data exfiltration, combined with file writing during exit, raises suspicion. Overall, it exhibits high malicious behavior potential, with a security risk score approaching 0.75 due to covert data collection and external communication.",
