{
  "purpose": "The code performs covert data exfiltration during package installation by collecting system info, encoding it, and sending it to an external server, while also writing a proof message to a file.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md', external IP via requests, system hostname via os.uname(), current directory path via pathlib, environment variables (indirectly), and potentially other system info.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to 'https://kotko.org' and 'https://api.ipify.org', writing to 'pocbykotko.txt' file.",
  "flows": "System info is gathered (IP, hostname, path) -> encoded in base64 -> appended to URL -> sent via GET request; also, a proof message is written to a file during exit.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, network activity during setup, writing proof file, encoding info before transmission, performing network requests in setup.py, no legitimate setup purpose for network/file operations.",
  "analysis": "The code registers an exit function that executes during package installation, which writes a proof file and exfiltrates system info covertly. It collects external IP, hostname, and directory path, encodes this info in base64, and sends it via a GET request to a suspicious domain. The variable names are obfuscated, indicating an attempt to hide malicious intent. The network activity and file writing during setup are unusual and suspicious, suggesting covert data collection or reconnaissance. The behavior aligns with malicious exfiltration rather than benign setup routines. The obfuscation and network activity justify high suspicion of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior through covert data exfiltration during package installation, with obfuscation and suspicious network activity. The activity is consistent with supply chain attack tactics. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with high malware and risk levels justified by the exfiltration and obfuscation. The overall assessment indicates a high-security threat, and the package should be considered malicious or highly suspicious.",
