{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, but it also contains hidden malicious activities such as data exfiltration and persistent backdoors.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.md file for long description, accesses the filesystem (e.g., creating 'pocbykotko.txt'), and fetches external data via requests (IP address and sending data to a suspicious URL). It also accesses system information via os.uname().",
  "sinks": "The code writes to a file ('pocbykotko.txt'), makes HTTP GET requests to potentially malicious URLs ('https://kotko.org' with encoded data), and encodes system data in base64 before sending. It can exfiltrate data such as IP address, hostname, and potentially sensitive path info.",
  "flows": "Input sources include reading the README.md, filesystem access, and external network requests to fetch IP and send data. The data flow involves collecting system info, encoding it, and transmitting it to a remote server via HTTP GET requests with encoded payloads.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual activities include writing a proof string to a text file, collecting system info (IP, hostname, path), encoding it in base64, and sending it to an external URL. The code's purpose is obscured by non-descriptive variable names and obfuscated data encoding. It also registers a function that executes upon installation, performing network activities without any user awareness.",
  "analysis": "The script is part of a setup process, but it secretly executes code that gathers system info, encodes it, and transmits it to a remote server ('https://kotko.org?'). It writes a proof message to a file, possibly as a backdoor or proof of compromise. It uses requests to exfiltrate data, which could be malicious. The obfuscation and hidden network activity are typical indicators of malicious intent. The code does not appear to perform any legitimate setup functions beyond packaging, instead focusing on covert data collection.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting system information, encoding it, and exfiltrating it to an external server during the installation process. It also creates a proof file, which may serve as a backdoor indicator. These activities are hidden within a package setup script, indicating a supply chain security risk.",
