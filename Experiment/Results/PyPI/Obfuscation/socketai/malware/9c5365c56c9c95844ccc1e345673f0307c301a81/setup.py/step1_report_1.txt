{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package distribution with custom installation behavior that includes data collection and network communication, potentially for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "Input sources include reading 'README.md' and 'pocbykotko.txt', making HTTP requests to 'https://api.ipify.org' and 'https://kotko.org', and accessing environment information such as 'os.uname()'.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are network requests sending data to external servers, writing to 'pocbykotko.txt', and encoding and transmitting system information.",
  "flows": "Data flows from system information (hostname, IP address, current directory) into encoded payloads, which are then sent via HTTP GET requests to external domains. Also, a file is written locally during installation.",
  "anomalies": "The code registers a function to run at exit that collects system and network info, encodes it in base64, and sends it to a suspicious external URL. The naming conventions are obfuscated, and the code writes to a file 'pocbykotko.txt' with a suspicious message. The usage of base64 encoding and network communication in a setup script is unusual and potentially malicious. The repeated imports and redundant setup calls indicate obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various modules, including 'requests' for network communication and 'pathlib' for file handling. It defines a custom install class that registers a function to execute upon exit. The exit function writes a message to 'pocbykotko.txt', then gathers the machine's public IP address via an external request, retrieves system hostname, encodes system path, and constructs a URL with this information, which it then sends to an external domain ('kotko.org'). This behavior resembles data exfiltration embedded within a package setup process. The obfuscated variable names and encoding techniques suggest an intent to hide malicious data collection activities. The package metadata is also consistent with standard packaging but combined with these behaviors, indicates malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by collecting system and network information during installation and sending it to an external server without user consent. The obfuscation and network communication embedded within the setup process point toward a supply chain attack or data exfiltration mechanism.",
