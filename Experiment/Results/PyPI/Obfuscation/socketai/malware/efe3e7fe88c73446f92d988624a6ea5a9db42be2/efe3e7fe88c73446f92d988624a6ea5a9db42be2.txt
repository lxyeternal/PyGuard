      "conclusion": "The code is malicious, functioning as a backdoor via reverse shell, with obfuscated functions to evade detection. It establishes a remote connection, spawns an interactive shell, and forks processes, indicating high malicious intent and security risk. The scores assigned in the reports are justified and accurately reflect the severity of the threat."
