      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign setup script employing obfuscation tactics that could conceal malicious dependencies or code elsewhere. There is no evidence of active malware or malicious behavior in this snippet. The obfuscation warrants caution and further review if additional context or code exists. The scores assigned are appropriate given the current evidence, with low malware risk but high obfuscation suspicion."

      "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and likely malicious due to its obfuscation and use of dynamic execution techniques. It should be treated as a security threat until further payload analysis confirms benign behavior."
