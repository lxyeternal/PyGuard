  "purpose": "Minimal setup script for a Python package, defining package metadata.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata; no dynamic input, environment variables, or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no code execution, network activity, or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "None; static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated attribute name 'gZQIoNsxaxiJdPWOfOWVPRRofOcJAfQL' assigned to dependencies, and a nonsensical package name 'wnwty4unz75a2e5t'. These are non-standard and suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static setup configuration with obfuscated attribute names and a random package name, which could be used to hide malicious dependencies or code. No active malicious behavior, network activity, or data leaks are present. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not demonstrate malicious intent. The dependency 'requests' is included in a non-standard parameter, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. The code uses deprecated 'distutils', indicating outdated practices but not maliciousness. The malware score is low (around 0.2), justified by the obfuscation. The obfuscated score is high (around 0.7), justified by the nonsensical attribute and package name. The overall security risk is moderate (~0.3), mainly due to obfuscation, but no active threats are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign setup script employing obfuscation tactics that could conceal malicious dependencies or code elsewhere. There is no evidence of active malware or malicious behavior in this snippet. The obfuscation warrants caution and further review if additional context or code exists. The scores assigned are appropriate given the current evidence, with low malware risk but high obfuscation suspicion.",
