  "purpose": "Decodes a base64-encoded string, unmarshals it with marshal.loads, and executes the resulting code object, likely containing malicious payloads.",
  "sources": "The base64-encoded string embedded in the code.",
  "sinks": "The exec() function executing the unmarshaled code, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.",
  "flows": "Base64 decoding -> marshal.loads -> exec()",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with base64 and marshal, no comments or external inputs, use of exec() on dynamically loaded code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs base64 decoding of an embedded string, unmarshals it with marshal.loads, and executes it via exec(). This pattern is a common obfuscation technique used in malicious scripts to hide payloads. The heavy obfuscation, combined with dynamic code execution, indicates high suspicion of malicious intent. Static analysis cannot determine the payload's behavior, but the pattern itself is a strong indicator of malware. The high scores assigned in the reports (malware 0.9, obfuscated 0.9, security risk 0.9) are justified given the potential for arbitrary malicious code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and likely malicious due to its obfuscation and use of dynamic execution techniques. It should be treated as a security threat until further payload analysis confirms benign behavior.",
