{
  "purpose": "This script appears to be a custom installer setup that performs hidden or malicious activities during installation, including downloading, decrypting, and executing a payload, potentially for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "Data is read from hardcoded byte arrays, file system operations, environment variables, and network requests (requests.get). It also reads files from specific paths during installation.",
  "sinks": "Network requests (requests.get), file writes to /tmp and user directories, execution of downloaded files via subprocess.Popen, and creating/writing files with suspicious filenames.",
  "flows": "Code decrypts data, constructs URLs based on platform architecture, fetches remote content, decrypts it, writes it to a file, makes it executable, and executes it. The flow involves reading hardcoded data, network activity, file creation/modification, and process execution.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variable names, encrypted/hardcoded byte arrays, dynamic URL construction based on system architecture, encrypted payload download and execution, writing files in hidden directories, and running downloaded payloads without clear purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing modules and defining obfuscated, encrypted byte sequences. It contains functions for cryptographic hashing, key stream generation, and decryption. During installation, it scans certain directories and compares decrypted data to a hardcoded value. If a match is found, it decrypts a URL based on system architecture, fetches a payload from this URL, decrypts it, writes it to a hidden directory, makes it executable, and then executes it via subprocess. The obfuscated variable names and dynamic URL assembly suggest an attempt to conceal malicious activity. The code's primary behavior—downloading and executing remote code—raises significant suspicion of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading, decrypting, and executing remote payloads during package installation, which is typical of supply chain attacks or backdoors. Its obfuscation and hidden file operations support this conclusion. This package should be considered dangerous for use.",
