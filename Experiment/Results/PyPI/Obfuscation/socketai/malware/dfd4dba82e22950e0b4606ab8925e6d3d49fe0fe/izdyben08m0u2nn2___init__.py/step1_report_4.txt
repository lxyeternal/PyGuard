  "purpose": "The code appears to perform data processing or utility functions, but the specific purpose cannot be determined from the provided snippet.",
  "sources": "Input data may come from function parameters, external files, or network requests (not explicitly shown). No clear sources are identifiable in the snippet provided.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, network operations, or data output functions; however, none are explicitly visible in this code fragment.",
  "flows": "Without explicit data flow in the snippet, it is unclear how data moves from sources to sinks. The code structure does not indicate any untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors are observed. No obfuscation or malicious code structures are evident.",
  "analysis": "The provided code fragment lacks explicit input, output, or control flow that could be exploited. It appears to be standard Python code with no signs of malware, data leakage, or malicious intent. Since the code is minimal or incomplete, a comprehensive review is limited, but no anomalies or malicious behaviors are apparent in the snippet provided.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code appears benign, with no suspicious or malicious activity detected.",
