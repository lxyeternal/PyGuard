  "conclusion": "The code review indicates that most code is benign or mildly suspicious, with Reports 2 and 3 showing signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution that suggest moderate malicious potential. The scores are aligned with the evidence, with a slight increase in Report 3's malware score from 0.4 to 0.5 to better reflect its suspicious patterns. Overall, the assessments are consistent and reasonable."
