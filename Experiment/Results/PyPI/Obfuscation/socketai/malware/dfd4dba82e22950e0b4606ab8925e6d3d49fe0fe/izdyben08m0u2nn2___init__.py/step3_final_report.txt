  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on obfuscation, dynamic execution, and suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, input data, environment variables, environment variables, user inputs, network strings, dynamic code execution points, obfuscated variables.",
  "sinks": "Network communication functions, subprocess calls, eval()/exec() points, environment variables, system calls, potential data leaks.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or inputs flow into eval()/exec() or network functions, indicating potential malicious activity or obfuscation.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation, dynamic code execution, use of eval()/exec(), hardcoded URLs/IPs, misleading variable names, lack of explicit malicious payloads but suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are common indicators of malicious intent. Reports 2 and 3 highlight use of eval()/exec() and network indicators, justifying higher malware scores. Report 1 shows obfuscation but no explicit malicious payloads, warranting a low malware score. Reports 4 and 5 lack code or clear suspicious activity, leading to zero scores. The scores across reports are generally consistent with the described behaviors, with minor adjustments recommended for Report 3's malware score. Overall, the suspicion levels are appropriately reflected in the scores, with Reports 2 and 3 warranting moderate concern due to obfuscation and dynamic execution, while others are benign or unreviewable.",
  "conclusion": "The code review indicates that most code is benign or mildly suspicious, with Reports 2 and 3 showing signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution that suggest moderate malicious potential. The scores are aligned with the evidence, with a slight increase in Report 3's malware score from 0.4 to 0.5 to better reflect its suspicious patterns. Overall, the assessments are consistent and reasonable.",
