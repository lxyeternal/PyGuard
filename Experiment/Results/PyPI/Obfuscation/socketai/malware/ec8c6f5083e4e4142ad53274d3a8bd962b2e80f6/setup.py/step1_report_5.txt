{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, but it also downloads and executes an external file from a Discord CDN URL, indicating potential malicious activity.",
  "sources": "Requests to external URL 'https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/.../win32.exe' and the subsequent download of content into a temporary file.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the downloaded file via subprocess.call, which runs the file as a system process.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the external URL (source) through the requests.get call, written into a temporary file, then executed via subprocess.call.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual inclusion of code to download and execute a file from a remote source during a setup script, which is atypical and suspicious for a legitimate package.",
  "analysis": "The script begins as a typical setup.py file, importing setuptools and defining package metadata. However, it then makes an HTTP GET request to a Discord CDN URL for an executable file. The content of this file is saved into a temporary file, which is then executed. This behavior is abnormal for a standard package setup and indicates an attempt to run potentially malicious code during installation, possibly as a backdoor or malware delivery mechanism.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external executable during package setup. The intent seems to be to run arbitrary code on the target system, which is a high security risk and strongly suspicious of malware. The overall security risk score is high, and the malware probability is also high.",
