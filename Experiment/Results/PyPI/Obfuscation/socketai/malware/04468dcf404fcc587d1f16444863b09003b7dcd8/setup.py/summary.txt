  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious intent due to the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during package setup, with techniques consistent with malware delivery. The obfuscation, stealth, and error suppression justify a high malware score and security risk. It is strongly recommended to decode and analyze the PowerShell payload to confirm its actions, but as it stands, this code should be treated as malicious or highly suspicious."
