  "purpose": "The code is used to configure the packaging of a Python project by specifying its name and version.",
  "sources": "The data is read from the import statement (setuptools) and the arguments passed to the setup() function.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function could potentially be used to execute arbitrary code if the arguments were malicious, but here they are static strings.",
  "flows": "The import of setuptools (source) leads to the setup() call with static parameters (sink), with no untrusted data involved.",
  "anomalies": "The package name 'zhgitfmzw1wu4w0r' appears as a random or obfuscated string, which is unusual but not inherently malicious; no other anomalies observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and calls setup() with fixed name and version. There are no dynamic or untrusted inputs, no code injection points, and no suspicious behaviors. The package name is unusual but not malicious. The code performs standard packaging setup procedures without any signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward package setup script with a suspiciously obfuscated package name but no malicious behavior detected. It does not contain malware or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
