  "purpose": "Configuration validation, environment and region restrictions, and key-value storage management.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions, global variables storing environment and region info, data added to global dictionaries and sets.",
  "sinks": "Global dictionaries and sets where configuration data and validation states are stored; exception raising for invalid configurations.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed, validated against allowed environments and regions, and stored in global structures; validation functions check data consistency.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated variable and function names, extensive use of global mutable state, no network or system modification activity, no hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment and region validation, storing configuration states in global variables. Obfuscated variable names suggest an attempt to conceal intent but do not indicate malicious behavior. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. The global state management and obfuscation could be exploited if part of a malicious supply chain, but in isolation, the code appears benign. The malware score should be 0, obfuscation score justified at around 0.75, and security risk score low (~0.2-0.3).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a configuration validation and management module with obfuscated naming, lacking evidence of malicious activity. The current scores are appropriate; malware likelihood is negligible, obfuscation is high but justified, and security risk is low. No active malicious behavior is detected.",
