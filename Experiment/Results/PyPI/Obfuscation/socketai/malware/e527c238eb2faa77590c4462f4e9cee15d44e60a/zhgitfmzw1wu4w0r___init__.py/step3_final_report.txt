  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or unsafe practices.",
  "sources": "Input data read from code variables, environment variables, network requests, file I/O, and dynamic code execution points.",
  "sinks": "Network communication (sending data, connecting to domains), file modification, environment variable access, system commands, and dynamic code evaluation.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as input variables or environment variables to sinks like network sockets or system commands, potentially via obfuscated or dynamic code paths.",
  "anomalies": "Signs of obfuscation (e.g., encoded strings, dynamic execution), hardcoded credentials, suspicious network domains, or unusual code constructs. Incomplete code snippets with missing context are noted.",
  "analysis": "The code shows minimal or no suspicious activity across all reports. Report 1 indicates signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution but lacks concrete malicious actions, leading to a low malware score (0.2). Other reports describe straightforward, benign code with no obfuscation or malicious patterns, supporting very low malware (0) and risk scores (~0.2-0.3). Confidence levels are moderate to high, consistent with the evidence. Overall, the assessments are cautious but justified, with no significant anomalies detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is predominantly benign with minor signs of obfuscation in one report. Malware likelihood is very low, and security risks are minimal. Scores are consistent with the evidence, and no adjustments are necessary at this stage.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
