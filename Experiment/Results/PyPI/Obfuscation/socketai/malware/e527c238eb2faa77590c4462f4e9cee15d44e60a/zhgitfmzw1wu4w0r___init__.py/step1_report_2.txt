  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a specific computational task, potentially involving data processing or utility functions. There are no clear indications of malicious intent or harmful operations.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters, variables, or external modules. Specific sources include reading environment variables, function arguments, or imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, file operations, or system commands. No evidence suggests untrusted data is being sent to these sinks in a malicious way.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as user inputs or environment variables to processing functions and then to sinks like output functions, logging, or network transmission. No suspicious or unexpected data flows are identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs are observed. The code does not contain obfuscated sections, unnecessary dynamic execution, or misleading variables.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with clear function definitions and logical control flow. It utilizes standard Python libraries and patterns. No signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or malicious backdoors are evident. The code appears to perform its intended task securely, with no suspicious operations or security weaknesses.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be benign, with no evidence of malware or supply chain sabotage. The overall security risk is low.",
