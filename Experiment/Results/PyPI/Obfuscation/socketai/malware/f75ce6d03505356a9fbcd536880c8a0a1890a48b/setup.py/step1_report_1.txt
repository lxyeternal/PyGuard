  "flows": "System info is collected (hostname and environment variables), encoded, and then sent via HTTP POST to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "The code obfuscates some variable names, uses a network to collect and transmit system data without user consent, and constructs a string with hostname and environment variables, then encodes it in a non-standard way before sending. The network address 'packageman.comlu.com' could be suspicious, as it is not a well-known domain. The code is also catching all exceptions silently, which may hide malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'distutils.core' and 'os', then attempts to gather system information including hostname and environment variables. It constructs a string with this data, encoding non-alphanumeric characters as hexadecimal escape sequences. It then establishes a TCP connection to 'packageman.comlu.com' on port 80 and sends this encoded data via HTTP POST. The try-except block suppresses errors, which can hide failures or malicious intent. The code does not perform any legitimate setup tasks or use the 'distutils.core.setup()' data meaningfully, indicating its primary purpose may be data exfiltration. The external server and domain are suspicious, and the data collection method is covert, consistent with malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is collecting system information and transmitting it to a remote server without user knowledge or consent, indicative of malicious activity such as data exfiltration. The obfuscation and silent error handling further suggest malicious intent. The overall security risk is high, and the code should be considered potentially malicious.",
