  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, defining package metadata and reading README for long description.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' file",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or harmful actions",
  "flows": "Read file -> setup() call",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function name; package name appears nonsensical or intentionally obfuscated",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with an obfuscated function name. It reads a README file and calls setup() with package info. No malicious code, network activity, or data exfiltration is present. The obfuscated function name and package name could be suspicious but are not inherently malicious. The code's simplicity and lack of external calls suggest low risk. The obfuscation may be intended to hide intent but does not constitute malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with no evidence of malicious activity or vulnerabilities. The main concern is obfuscation, which warrants cautious monitoring but does not indicate malicious intent based on this snippet alone.",
