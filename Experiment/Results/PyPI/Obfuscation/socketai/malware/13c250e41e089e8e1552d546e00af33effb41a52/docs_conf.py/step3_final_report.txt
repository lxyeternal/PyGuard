{
  "purpose": "Static configuration data for documentation or project setup, likely auto-generated or obfuscated.",
  "sources": "Variable assignments, list initializations, dictionary definitions, static string values.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, no data sinks, no external data processing or network activity.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; all data is static and hardcoded.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names with nonsensical identifiers; no dynamic code execution or external interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static script defining variables, lists, and dictionaries with hardcoded strings. No functions, input/output, network calls, or dynamic behavior are present. Variable names are obfuscated but do not indicate malicious intent; they likely serve as configuration or auto-generated placeholders. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The obfuscation level is moderate but not suspicious, and the overall structure is benign. The scores assigned in the reports—malware at 0, low security risk, moderate obfuscation—are consistent with the static, non-malicious nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration snippet with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The current scores and assessments are appropriate and should remain as they are.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
