  "purpose": "Import modules related to 'jellyfish' for string comparison or similar functionality, with fallback options.",
  "sources": "Attempted import statements from relative modules (.cjellyfish and ._jellyfish).",
  "sinks": "No direct sink points for untrusted data are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No flow from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks; import logic is straightforward.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names (BDDUSjMjZOcLJMtrEhZxhefVYPExvTqL) which appears to be intentionally obscure. No other suspicious code or behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code tries to import a module named 'cjellyfish' and sets a variable accordingly; if that fails, it imports '_jellyfish' and sets the variable differently. The variable names are intentionally obscure, possibly to hinder analysis, but no malicious code or suspicious activity is present. The import patterns are standard, and no data leakage, network activity, or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs conditional module imports with obfuscated variable names but contains no malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The obfuscation appears superficial and intended to complicate analysis but does not indicate malicious intent.",
