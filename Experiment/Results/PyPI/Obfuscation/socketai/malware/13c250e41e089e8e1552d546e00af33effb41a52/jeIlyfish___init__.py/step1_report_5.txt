  "purpose": "Attempt to import a module named 'cjellyfish' or fallback to '_jellyfish' and set a string variable based on the import success.",
  "sources": "The import statements and the try-except block for module import.",
  "sinks": "The setting of the variable 'BDDUSjMjZOcLJMtrEhZxhefVYPExvTqL', which could potentially be used later in the program.",
  "flows": "Import attempt from either '.cjellyfish' or '._jellyfish' modules, then assignment to the variable based on success or failure.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obscure variable names that appear randomly generated or obfuscated, with no clear purpose. No external input or data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import modules with highly obfuscated names, switching between two modules based on import success. The variable names are nonsensical, which could suggest obfuscation. The code does not read user input, network data, or environment variables. No malicious functions or suspicious behaviors are directly evident. The import fallback indicates modular design, not necessarily malicious intent. No data leakage, credential handling, or malicious system actions are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be an obfuscated import mechanism with no immediate signs of malicious behavior. It is possibly part of a larger, intentionally obfuscated codebase, but as a standalone snippet, it does not demonstrate malicious activity or security risks.",
