{
  "purpose": "The code attempts to import a module, preferring a local 'cjellyfish' and falling back to '_jellyfish' if the first import fails. It also assigns a string to a variable based on which import succeeds.",
  "sources": "The import statements that load modules 'cjellyfish' or '_jellyfish'.",
  "sinks": "Assignment to the variable BDDUSjMjZOcLJMtrEhZxhefVYPExvTqL; no other data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Module import source (cjellyfish or _jellyfish) → success/failure branch → variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "The variable name 'BDDUSjMjZOcLJMtrEhZxhefVYPExvTqL' appears obfuscated, and the module names 'cjellyfish' and '_jellyfish' are unusual or generic; no explicit malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard try-except import pattern to load different modules based on availability. The variable naming is obscure, but this alone is not evidence of malicious intent. No suspicious network activity, data leaks, or code execution mechanisms are present. The import logic is straightforward and common in modular Python code. The code does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration. It simply sets a variable based on which module is imported successfully.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign module import pattern with obfuscated variable naming, possibly for modular or versioning purposes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this fragment.",
