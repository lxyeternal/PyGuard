{
  "purpose": "The code attempts to import a module related to 'jellyfish' and sets a variable based on the success of the import, likely for configuration or environment detection.",
  "sources": "The import statements from relative modules (.cjellyfish or ._jellyfish).",
  "sinks": "None directly; no untrusted data output or data leak points are present.",
  "flows": "The flow depends on whether the import succeeds or raises ImportError; setting of the variable based on the import outcome.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable name BDDUSjMjZOcLJMtrEhZxhefVYPExvTqL, which appears intentionally obfuscated. The code relies on dynamic import fallback, which is common but worth noting.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a conditional import of modules related to 'jellyfish' and sets a variable based on the import success. The variable names are obfuscated, which could be a red flag, but the logic itself is straightforward and does not include any malicious activity. No data leaks, network activity, or code execution mechanisms are present. The purpose seems to be configuration or environment detection. There is no suspicious or malicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and appears benign, involving conditional module import with obfuscated variable names. There is no indication of malicious intent or security risks based on the provided code.",
