  "purpose": "The code attempts to import a module, preferring 'cjellyfish' and falling back to '_jellyfish' if the first import fails, and sets a variable accordingly.",
  "sources": "The import statements for 'cjellyfish' and '_jellyfish'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted input or data; no sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Imports are attempted from local modules; no data flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The variable names ('BDDUSjMjZOcLJMtrEhZxhefVYPExvTqL') appear obfuscated or auto-generated, which can be suspicious but might be a normal practice in some contexts.",
  "analysis": "The code checks for the presence of a specific module and imports it accordingly, setting a variable based on the import success. The obfuscated variable name could suggest attempts to conceal intent, but there is no active malicious activity such as network access, data exfiltration, or system modification. The import logic itself is straightforward and not inherently malicious. No secrets, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The only concern is the obfuscated variable name, which might be used to hide malicious intent, but based solely on this fragment, it appears as benign import handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module import with an obfuscated variable name; no malicious behavior or security risks are evident from this snippet. It appears to be a benign import pattern, possibly with obfuscation or auto-generation, but nothing suspicious is directly observable.",
