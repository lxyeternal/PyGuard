  "sources": "Import statements from local modules, setting the variable BDDUSjMjZOcLJMtrEhZxhefVYPExvTqL",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external system interaction present",
  "flows": "Attempt to import 'cjellyfish'; on success, set variable to 'C'; on failure, import '_jellyfish' and set variable to 'Python'",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable name, but no malicious code or suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward try-except import pattern, with an obfuscated variable name that appears auto-generated or stylistic. No data leaks, network activity, or malicious functions are present. The obfuscation is superficial and common in some codebases. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, with no evidence of malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's behavior. No anomalies or malicious indicators are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated conditional import pattern with no malicious or security-threatening behavior. The obfuscation is superficial, and the overall security risk is minimal. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
