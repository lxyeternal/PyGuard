{
  "purpose": "Custom setup script that extends the installation process to collect system information and send it to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Data is collected from socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), and getpass.getuser(). The data is sent via an HTTP GET request to an external URL during installation.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get() function transmits collected data to an external server, potentially leaking sensitive environment info or system identifiers.",
  "flows": "Source data (hostname, current working directory, username) is gathered in the custom install class method and then transmitted to an external URL via requests.get().",
  "anomalies": "The code secretly extends the standard install process with a custom class that gathers system info and exfiltrates it without user consent. The target URL appears suspicious or non-standard. Obfuscated class name and method names suggest concealment.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and defines a subclass of setuptools.command.install. Within the overridden method, it gathers system info (hostname, current directory, username) and sends this data to a remote URL without any user prompt or indication. This behavior resembles data exfiltration during installation, a common tactic in malicious Python packages. No other suspicious or malicious activity is present. The code’s purpose appears to be secretly collecting and transmitting system info during installation, which could be used for tracking or malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious behavior: exfiltrating system information to an external server during package installation. The use of obfuscated class and method names further suggests intent to conceal malicious activity. This pattern indicates potential malicious intent, representing a security risk if used in a package.",
