  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to collect system information and send it to an external server during package installation.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() with parameters containing system info sent over the network",
  "flows": "collect system info (hostname, cwd, username) -> send data via HTTP GET request to external URL",
  "anomalies": "The code captures hostname, current directory, and username and sends this data to an external URL during installation, which is unusual and potentially malicious behavior. The code uses obfuscated class and method names, indicating an attempt to hide malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code redefines the install command class to include additional behavior during installation. It gathers hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data to an external server via a GET request. This behavior is not typical for standard package installation and suggests data exfiltration. The use of obfuscated class and method names further raises suspicion. No other benign functionality is present, and no legitimate purpose for sending this info is evident. These actions could enable tracking or unauthorized data collection without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior aimed at collecting and transmitting system information during package installation. It is designed to operate stealthily by obfuscation and atypical actions, indicating a supply chain security risk.",
