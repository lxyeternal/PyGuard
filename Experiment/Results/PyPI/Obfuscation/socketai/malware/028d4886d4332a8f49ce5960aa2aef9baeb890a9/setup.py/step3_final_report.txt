{
  "purpose": "The code collects hostname, current directory, and username during package installation and exfiltrates this data to an external URL, indicating malicious intent to spy on the user.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() with parameters sent to external URL",
  "flows": "source functions (hostname, cwd, username) -> data assembled into dict -> requests.get() call with data as params",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names, data exfiltration during setup without user consent, no validation or encryption, external URL is suspicious",
  "analysis": "The code redefines the install command to include a step that collects system info and sends it to an external server during package installation. The obfuscation and network activity are typical of covert data collection. No malicious payloads or destructive actions are present beyond exfiltration. The behavior is clearly malicious, with high potential privacy violations. The obfuscation and data exfiltration justify high malware and obfuscation scores, and the privacy risk is significant.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, performing covert data exfiltration during installation with obfuscation to hide intent. It poses a high privacy and security risk and should be flagged for removal or further investigation.",
