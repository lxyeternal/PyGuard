{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for a Python package that, during installation, collects system information and sends it to an external server.",
  "sources": "Reads system hostname, current working directory, and username during the installation process.",
  "sinks": "Sends collected system information via an HTTP GET request to an external URL.",
  "flows": "System information is collected in the custom 'install' class method and then sent over the network through requests.get().",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a custom install class with obfuscated class and method names, and it transmits system info to an external server without user consent or apparent purpose. The URL used is suspiciously obscure and may be malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom installation command that extends setuptools' install class. During installation, it gathers hostname, current directory, and username using standard libraries and sends this data via an HTTP GET request to an external URL. The obfuscated class and method names are suspicious, indicating an attempt to hide malicious intent. The data exfiltration occurs automatically during package installation, which is a malicious behavior if done without user knowledge. The URL used is obscure and could be a command and control server or data collection endpoint. The code does not perform any other malicious activity such as code injection, privilege escalation, or data theft beyond system info exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs malicious data exfiltration during package installation, with obfuscated code and suspicious network activity. It appears designed to silently collect and send system information to an external server without user consent, indicating malicious intent.",
