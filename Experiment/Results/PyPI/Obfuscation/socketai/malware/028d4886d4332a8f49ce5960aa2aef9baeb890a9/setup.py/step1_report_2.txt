{
  "purpose": "Define a custom installation command that collects system information and sends it to a remote server during package installation.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() with remote URL and parameters containing system info",
  "flows": "System info is gathered from sources and sent via an HTTP GET request to an external server",
  "anomalies": "Code collects host, current directory, and username data and transmits it without user consent or notification; code appears intentionally obfuscated with random class and method names; no input validation or encryption present",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the 'install' command from setuptools to execute additional code during package installation. It gathers hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this information via a GET request to an external URL. The obfuscated class and method names suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent. Data collection occurs silently during install, which may be used for tracking or exfiltration purposes. No signs of malicious payload like data theft, backdoors, or system damage are evident, but the data exfiltration itself is suspicious without user knowledge.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs covert data collection and transmission during package installation, indicating malicious intent related to user tracking or data exfiltration. While it doesn't execute destructive actions, the behavior violates user privacy and security best practices.",
