{
  "purpose": "Custom setup script that extends the installation process to perform additional actions during package installation.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser(), requests.get() with parameters derived from system info",
  "sinks": "requests.get() request sending data to an external URL",
  "flows": "During installation, the code gathers hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via a GET request to an external server",
  "anomalies": "The code collects system info and transmits it during the install process without user consent or explicit disclosure; variable and class names are obfuscated and intentionally confusing",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class inheriting from setuptools' install command. It overrides the run method to gather hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this information as URL parameters to an external URL. This behavior is hidden within a setup script, which is generally not expected to perform network activity like data exfiltration. The obfuscated class and method names suggest intent to hide malicious activity. No other malicious behaviors such as code injection, backdoors, or destructive actions are observed, but the data collection and transmission pattern indicates potential privacy violation or covert tracking.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs system information collection and sends it to an external URL during package installation, which could be used for malicious surveillance or tracking. The obfuscation and hidden network activity raise suspicion. It is recommended to scrutinize or avoid using this package.",
