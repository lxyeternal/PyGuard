      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity, including command-and-control communication, obfuscation, and potential supply chain compromise. The behaviors justify high malware (~0.75), obfuscation (~0.65), and security risk (~0.8) scores. It should be treated as malicious or compromised, and further investigation is recommended."

The assessments are consistent, reasonable, and require no adjustments. Future reviews should include actual code for a comprehensive security analysis."
