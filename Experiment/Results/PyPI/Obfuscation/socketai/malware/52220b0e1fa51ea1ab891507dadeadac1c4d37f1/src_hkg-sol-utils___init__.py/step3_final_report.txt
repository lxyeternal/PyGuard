{
  "purpose": "The code review aims to identify malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and suspicious patterns within the provided Python code or dependency.",
  "sources": "Input data read from environment variables, user inputs, or external files; code execution points such as eval, exec, or subprocess calls.",
  "sinks": "Data leakage points, network communication functions, file write operations, or system modifications that could lead to security issues.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources through processing functions to sinks, potentially leading to vulnerabilities if untrusted data is mishandled.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code segments that deviate from standard practices.",
  "analysis": "Given the absence of actual code snippets, no source, sink, flow, or anomaly detection is possible. The reports correctly acknowledge this limitation, assigning zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, with confidence scores of zero. The reasoning is consistent and cautious, avoiding unwarranted assumptions. Without code, malicious behavior cannot be confirmed or denied. The scores and conclusions are appropriate and justified based on the provided information.",
  "conclusion": "All reports accurately reflect the lack of code, correctly assigning zero risk, malware, and obfuscation scores. No evidence of malicious activity or vulnerabilities is present. The assessments are consistent, reasonable, and require no adjustments. Future reviews should include actual code for a comprehensive security analysis.",
