  "purpose": "Evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks, focusing on import statements and potential malicious activity.",
  "sources": "The import os statement, potential future function calls, and any embedded logic or data flows.",
  "sinks": "Any use of os functions, data leaks, network connections, or other untrusted data handling points.",
  "flows": "Import statement as source; no data flow present in minimal code; potential future use of os functions as sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of high security risk score (0.9) despite no code activity; overestimation of risk in minimal code context.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify that 'import os' alone is benign, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0. The only inconsistency is in Report 3, where the securityRisk is set to 0.9 despite no evidence of risk. This score should be lowered to reflect the benign nature. Reports 4 and others appropriately assign low risk scores (0 or 0.1), considering potential future misuse but currently no actual threat. Confidence levels are high across reports, given the simplicity of the code. The overall assessment confirms no malicious or obfuscated behavior, and the risk scores should be minimal.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets are benign, consisting solely of an import statement. The high security risk score in Report 3 is unjustified and should be revised downward. Malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
