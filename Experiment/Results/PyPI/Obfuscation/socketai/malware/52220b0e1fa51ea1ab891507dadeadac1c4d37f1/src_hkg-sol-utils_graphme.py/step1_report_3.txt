  "sinks": "No sinks are present, as there are no function calls or operations that process data or perform actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows or processing paths are established; the code only imports a module and terminates.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and does not contain any unusual or suspicious elements. The import of 'os' alone is common and not malicious.",
