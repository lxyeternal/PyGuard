  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and anomalies.",
  "sources": "Input functions, external calls, environment variables, network connections, data processing points.",
  "sinks": "Output functions, network transmissions, file writes, environment variable accesses.",
  "flows": "Sources to sinks via data processing routines, network calls, or environment interactions.",
  "anomalies": "Lack of comments, minimal validation, potential hardcoded secrets, obfuscation signs, or unusual variable usage.",
  "analysis": "The code shows no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, network connections to suspicious domains, or system sabotage. The absence of code in some reports limits analysis, but where code exists, no malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious external calls are detected. The security risk is primarily due to lack of input validation or documentation, not malicious intent. Malware scores are consistently zero, obfuscation is not detected, and confidence levels are high where analysis exists. Overall, the code appears benign with minor security concerns related to validation, which do not constitute malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency exhibits no evidence of malware or obfuscation. The low security risk stems from potential lack of input validation rather than malicious intent. The assessments and scores are consistent with the available information, indicating a safe dependency with minor security considerations.",
