      "conclusion": "The code contains highly suspicious, obfuscated, and stealthy execution of a PowerShell command during package setup, indicative of malicious activity. The use of encoded commands, silent execution, and error suppression are red flags for supply chain compromise or malware. Without decoding the payload, definitive confirmation isn't possible, but the pattern warrants treating this as malicious with high confidence."
