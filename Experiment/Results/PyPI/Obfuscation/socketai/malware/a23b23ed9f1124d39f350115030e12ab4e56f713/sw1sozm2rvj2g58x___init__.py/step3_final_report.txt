  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "User inputs (`input()`), environment variables (`os.environ`), dynamic imports, eval/exec calls, untrusted data passed to system commands (`subprocess`).",
  "sinks": "System commands (`subprocess`), network communication, file operations, external modules, eval/exec execution points.",
  "flows": "Data from sources (inputs, environment variables) to sinks via dynamic code execution, command invocation, or indirect references.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec, dynamic imports, obfuscated variable names, indirect control flow, lack of code in some reports, suspicious patterns like dynamic code execution and obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code in Report 2 and 3 shows no explicit malicious activity but presents moderate security concerns due to untrusted inputs and potential command injection. Report 4 contains dynamic imports, eval/exec, and obfuscation, indicating elevated risk and possible malicious intent. The scores assigned in the original reports are generally consistent with these observations, though slight adjustments can better reflect suspicion levels. Reports 1 and 5 lack code, appropriately scored as zero. The suspicion in Report 4 warrants a higher malware score (0.5) and security risk (0.7) to account for the observed patterns.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign, with some reports indicating patterns that could be exploited maliciously. The adjusted scores better represent the potential risks, especially for Report 4, which exhibits suspicious dynamic code patterns. Overall, the dependency shows low to moderate risk, with no confirmed malware, but certain patterns merit further review.",
