  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign, with some reports indicating patterns that could be exploited maliciously. The adjusted scores better represent the potential risks, especially for Report 4, which exhibits suspicious dynamic code patterns. Overall, the dependency shows low to moderate risk, with no confirmed malware, but certain patterns merit further review."
