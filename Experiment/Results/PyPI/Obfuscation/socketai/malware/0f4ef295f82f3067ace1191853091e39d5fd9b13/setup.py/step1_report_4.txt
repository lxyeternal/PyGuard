{
  "purpose": "The code appears to modify the installation process to gather system information, check for specific directories, and exfiltrate files and system data to an external server.",
  "sources": "System hostname, current working directory, user name, specific system files ('/.dockerenv', '/root/.wget-hsts', '/run/docker.sock'), directory listings ('/run/', '/etc/', '/home/', '/mnt/', '/rasp/')",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST requests to external domain 'https://j0j0.xyz/lists/...' and file uploads to 'https://j0j0.xyz/.../files/'",
  "flows": "System data (hostname, user, directory listings, files) are collected as variables, then sent via POST requests to an external server, potentially exfiltrating sensitive information",
  "anomalies": "The code uses obfuscated class and variable names, accesses sensitive system files ('/.dockerenv', '/root/.wget-hsts', '/run/docker.sock') and directories, and posts data to a suspicious external domain. It attempts to open files typically used in container environments, indicating possible malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script redefines the installation command to include malicious activities. It gathers system info like hostname, user, and directory contents, and attempts to open specific system files related to Docker and system configuration. These files and data are then exfiltrated via HTTP POST requests to an external server under suspicious URL 'https://j0j0.xyz/...'. The code is obfuscated with non-descriptive variable and class names, further indicating malicious intent. The data exfiltration includes potentially sensitive system files, suggesting data theft capabilities. The script’s actions are typical of malware aimed at reconnaissance and data exfiltration during installation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, designed to gather system information and exfiltrate sensitive files to a malicious external server during package installation. Its obfuscation, access to sensitive files, and external communications confirm its harmful intent.",
