{
  "purpose": "The code appears to modify installation behavior to collect system information and send files and system data to an external server, potentially for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "System information is collected via socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser(), and os.listdir() on multiple directories. Files are read from '/.dockerenv', '/root/.wget-hsts', and '/run/docker.sock'.",
  "sinks": "Data is posted via HTTP requests to 'https://j0j0.xyz/lists/...' URLs. Files are uploaded through POST requests, including system files like '/.dockerenv', '/root/.wget-hsts', and '/run/docker.sock'.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, current directory, username, directory listings) is gathered and sent via POST requests. Additionally, specific files are read and their contents uploaded to the external server, facilitating data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses obfuscated class and variable names, performs data exfiltration by reading system files and sending them over network requests, and attempts to write to a root file '/root/j0j0.poc' while also reading sensitive system files. The use of '/run/docker.sock' and Docker-related files suggests possible reconnaissance or malicious control attempts. The requests are sent to suspicious, unverified domain 'j0j0.xyz'.",
  "analysis": "The script redefines the install command to execute additional malicious behavior during package installation. It collects system info and sensitive files, then exfiltrates this data to an external server via HTTP POST requests. The obfuscated class and variable names hinder understanding, but the pattern of collecting system details and uploading them, especially files like '/.dockerenv' and Docker socket, strongly indicate malicious intent. The script does not perform any benign or legitimate functionality; rather, it covertly gathers and transmits potentially sensitive data.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by gathering system information and files, then exfiltrating them to an external server. It is designed to be stealthy with obfuscated names and indirect data collection methods. The overall security risk is high, and the code should be considered malicious.",
