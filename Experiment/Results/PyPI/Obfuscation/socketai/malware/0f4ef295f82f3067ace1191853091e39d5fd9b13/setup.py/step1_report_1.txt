{
  "purpose": "Custom setup script that executes on installation, collecting system information and exfiltrating certain files to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Input sources include system files ('/root/j0j0.poc', '/.dockerenv', '/root/.wget-hsts', '/run/docker.sock'), environment data (hostname, username, current directory), and files read from specific system paths.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to 'https://j0j0.xyz/lists/...', posting data extracted from system files and directories, and uploading specific sensitive files.",
  "flows": "System data and files are collected from input sources, then sent via HTTP POST requests to a remote server, potentially transmitting sensitive information such as system configuration and files.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses obfuscated class and variable names, reads sensitive system files (like docker.sock and specific configuration files), and posts data to a suspicious domain. The attempt to open '/root/j0j0.poc' and upload critical files without clear purpose indicates malicious intent. The code also does not follow typical setup procedures, instead performing covert data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The script is a heavily obfuscated setup routine that, instead of performing typical installation tasks, collects system information and sensitive files, then exfiltrates them to a suspicious external domain. It accesses files that could contain sensitive data or system configurations, including Docker socket, root environment, and system configuration files, indicating potential reconnaissance or backdoor activity. The use of hardcoded domain, extensive try-except blocks, and sending multiple system files strongly suggests malicious intent. The code does not serve a legitimate setup purpose and exhibits behaviors consistent with malware or data theft tools.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, designed to secretly collect and transmit sensitive system information and files to an external server. Its obfuscated nature and suspicious file handling strongly indicate malicious intent. It should be flagged for removal and further investigation.",
