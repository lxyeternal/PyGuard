  "purpose": "Custom installation script that gathers system information and exfiltrates specific files and environment data to a remote server.",
  "sources": "System hostname, current working directory, user name, system directories (/run/, /etc/, /home/, /mnt/, /rasp/), files (/root/j0j0.poc, /.dockerenv, /root/.wget-hsts, /run/docker.sock).",
  "sinks": "Remote POST requests to https://j0j0.xyz/lists/... and https://j0j0.xyz/... with data from system info and files.",
  "flows": "System info and directory listings are collected and stored in variables, then sent via HTTP POST requests to the remote server. Files are opened and their contents posted as well.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of code that exfiltrates system files and environment info to an external server. File paths like '/.dockerenv' and '/root/.wget-hsts' are targeted for data exfiltration. Hardcoded URL and file handling suggest malicious intent. The class name and variable names are obfuscated, indicating concealment.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom setup command that, during installation, collects various system details, including hostname, user, and directory listings from common system directories. It attempts to open and send contents of sensitive files (/root/j0j0.poc, /.dockerenv, /root/.wget-hsts, /run/docker.sock) to an external domain. All data is sent via POST requests to a suspicious domain 'j0j0.xyz', indicating data exfiltration. The obfuscated class and variable names suggest concealment of malicious intent. The code does not perform any legitimate setup tasks beyond data collection and exfiltration, which is suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears malicious, designed to gather system information and exfiltrate sensitive files to an attacker-controlled server. The obfuscation and targeted data exfiltration strongly suggest malicious intent.",
