  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious, potentially malicious behavior through obfuscated, stealthy execution of a PowerShell command during setup. The high obfuscation and silent execution justify elevated malware and risk scores. It is recommended to decode and analyze the payload for definitive assessment; until then, the behavior should be treated as highly suspicious and potentially dangerous."
