{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script that, upon installation, sends system information to a Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname() and socket.gethostbyname() functions reading system hostname and IP address; no other explicit data sources.",
  "sinks": "Webhook URL receiving system hostname and IP address; network call via aiohttp to send data to Discord webhook.",
  "flows": "Data flow from socket.gethostname() and socket.gethostbyname() into an asynchronous function that sends this data to a Discord webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names; asynchronous function defined inside a class method; use of hardcoded Discord webhook URL; no validation or user input involved.",
  "analysis": "The code is a setup script that overrides the install command. During installation, it asynchronously collects the system's hostname and IP address and then sends this information to a hardcoded Discord webhook. The use of obfuscated class/method names and asynchronous calls within the install method suggests an attempt to conceal malicious activity. The direct transmission of system info to a remote server without user consent or transparency is suspicious. There are no other indications of malicious payloads or backdoors beyond the data exfiltration behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs covert data exfiltration of system hostname and IP address to a remote Discord webhook during package installation, indicating malicious intent. This behavior is hidden within the setup process and involves obfuscated code, raising significant security concerns.",
