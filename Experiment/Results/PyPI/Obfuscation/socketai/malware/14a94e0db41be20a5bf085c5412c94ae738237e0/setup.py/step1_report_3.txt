{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package that, upon installation, sends hostname and IP address information to a specified Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), socket.gethostbyname(), and the code within the async function that gathers hostname and IP data.",
  "sinks": "The Discord webhook URL used with aiohttp to send data; specifically, the Webhook.send() method which transmits hostname and IP address information.",
  "flows": "The script retrieves hostname and IP, then asynchronously sends this data to the Discord webhook URL during installation.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains an obfuscated class and method names, uses asynchronous code in the install class method, and performs network activity during package installation without user consent. Hardcoded webhook URL is suspicious. No validation or user prompts are present. The code does not log or store data locally, but it exfiltrates information silently.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that, during package installation, retrieves system hostname and IP address. It then constructs an asynchronous function that sends this data to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. The use of obfuscated class/method names suggests an attempt to hide malicious intent. Network activity (sending system info to an external server) occurs automatically during install, which is suspicious. The presence of a webhook URL and asynchronous code embedded in setup scripts is a typical pattern for data exfiltration or command-and-control communications. There is no evidence of other malicious actions like privilege escalation or backdoors, but the exfiltration of environment-specific data during installation is concerning.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to exfiltrate hostname and IP address information to an external Discord webhook during package installation. The obfuscation and behavior of transmitting system info without user consent suggest malicious intent. This behavior poses a security risk as it leaks potentially sensitive system data to an external party. Overall, this package exhibits malicious behavior and should be considered unsafe for use.",
