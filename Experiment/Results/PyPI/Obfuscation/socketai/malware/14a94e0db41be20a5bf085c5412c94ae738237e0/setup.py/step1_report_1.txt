{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package and, during installation, sends hostname and IP address information to a Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), socket.gethostbyname()",
  "sinks": "Discord webhook (Webhook.from_url and send method)",
  "flows": "hostname/IP address collected from sources → webhook URL send in asynchronous function",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names; code executes network request during installation; asynchronous call initiated during install process; hardcoded webhook URL; no user input handling; no apparent user-facing functionality",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command class that, upon installation, gathers system hostname and IP address. It then asynchronously sends this information to a specific Discord webhook URL using the discord.py library's Webhook object. The webhook URL is hardcoded, and the network request is initiated automatically during the installation process, which is unusual and potentially malicious. The obfuscated class and method names suggest attempts to hide malicious intent. No user input is processed, and the code performs network communication without user consent. These behaviors are indicative of a possible data exfiltration or malicious tracking activity during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The package includes malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information to an external webhook during installation. The obfuscation and automatic network request imply malicious intent or tracking. This code poses a security risk if installed in production environments.",
