  "purpose": "The code exfiltrates system hostname and IP address during package installation by sending data to a hardcoded Discord webhook, indicating malicious intent for covert data collection.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), socket.gethostbyname()",
  "sinks": "aiohttp.ClientSession() network request to the webhook URL",
  "flows": "hostname/IP data collected from sources, passed to Webhook.send() via asynchronous function during install",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names, asynchronous network call during setup, hardcoded webhook URL, automatic execution without user consent",
  "analysis": "The code defines an obfuscated install class that, during setup, asynchronously sends hostname and IP address to a fixed Discord webhook. The network activity occurs automatically, with no user interaction, and the data exfiltration is covert. The obfuscation and hardcoded URL suggest malicious intent. The activity is consistent with malicious data theft rather than benign behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.8, security risk ~0.9, obfuscated ~0.75) are justified by the covert exfiltration, obfuscation, and potential privacy violations.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates high-confidence malicious behavior through covert data exfiltration during installation, supported by obfuscation and hardcoded webhook. It poses a significant security risk and should be flagged as malicious. The scores are appropriate and reflect the severity of the activity.",
