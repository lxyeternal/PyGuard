{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script that, during installation, attempts to send the hostname and IP address to a specified Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "The code reads the hostname and IP address using socket.gethostname() and socket.gethostbyname() functions.",
  "sinks": "The data is sent via an asynchronous HTTP POST request to a Discord webhook URL using aiohttp and discord.Webhook.",
  "flows": "The hostname and IP address are collected and then sent asynchronously to the Discord webhook URL during the install process.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains obfuscated class and function names, uses asynchronous code inside a setup script, and sends system information to an external server (Discord webhook) during installation, which is suspicious. It also hardcodes a Discord webhook URL, which can be malicious if used for data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools and defines a custom install class that overrides the installation method. During installation, it retrieves the system's hostname and IP address. It then defines an asynchronous function that sends this information to a Discord webhook URL. The function is invoked immediately via asyncio. This behavior suggests potential data exfiltration of system info without user consent. The obfuscated naming and sending data to an external webhook during package installation are suspicious behaviors. No malicious payloads like malware, backdoors, or destructive actions are present beyond the data transmission, but the activity itself is malicious from a supply chain security perspective.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious in behavior because it exfiltrates system information during package installation without user awareness, using obfuscated code and hardcoded webhook. This pattern indicates potential malicious intent or sabotage in the package, constituting a security threat.",
