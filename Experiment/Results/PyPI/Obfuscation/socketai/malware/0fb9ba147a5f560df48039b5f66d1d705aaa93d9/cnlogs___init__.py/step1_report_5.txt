  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility functions, but the specific intent cannot be definitively determined from the given snippet.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters, environment variables, and possibly external files or network sources (if present elsewhere). No explicit data input points are visible in the snippet provided.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections (e.g., sending data over sockets), file writes, or subprocess executions if present elsewhere. In this snippet, no direct sinks are identified.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (function args, environment variables) to processing functions; without network or file operations shown, no source-to-sink flow is explicitly observable.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials or secrets are detected. No obfuscated code, malicious code, or suspicious constructs are apparent. The code structure appears straightforward and legitimate.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed thoroughly; it performs typical data processing tasks without unusual language features or obfuscation. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious patterns are identified. The overall structure indicates standard utility or application code.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code appears benign with no anomalies or malicious intent detected.",
