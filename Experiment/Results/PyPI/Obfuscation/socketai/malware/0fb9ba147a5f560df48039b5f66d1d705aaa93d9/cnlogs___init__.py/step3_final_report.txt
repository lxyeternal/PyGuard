  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Input data from parameters, environment variables, network connections, hardcoded URLs/keys, dynamic execution functions like eval/exec.",
  "sinks": "Network transmissions, file writes, environment variable access, potential data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input parameters or environment variables flow into processing functions; suspicious flows include dynamic code execution and data transmission to external domains.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation tactics, dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, suspicious data flows, misleading variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits typical signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution in suspicious cases (reports 2 and 3). Reports 1, 4, and 5 lack such features and are benign. The scores assigned generally reflect these observations, with higher malware and obfuscation scores correlating with suspicious features. Minor adjustments could be made to slightly lower the malware score in report 2 due to lack of concrete malicious activity, but current scores are acceptable and consistent.",
  "conclusion": "Most reports correctly identify benign or suspicious code. Reports 2 and 3 show signs of obfuscation and potential malicious intent, warranting higher scores. Overall, the scoring aligns well with the analysis; no major revisions needed.",
