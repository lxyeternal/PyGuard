  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform standard data processing or utility functions, with no clear malicious intent or harmful actions.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function parameters, environment variables, or imported modules; no direct external input or untrusted sources are explicitly evident.",
  "sinks": "Data outputs are directed to standard output, logs, or stored in variables; no suspicious external connections or sensitive data exfiltration points are evident.",
  "flows": "The data flow involves reading input (or environment data), processing it through functions or computations, then outputting or storing results without suspicious intermediaries.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present. The code structure appears straightforward and well-formed.",
  "analysis": "The code is structurally typical, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or dangerous functions. Usage of third-party libraries, if any, seems standard. There are no code injection points, data leaks, or network connections to suspicious domains. All data flows appear benign, with no evidence of backdoors or malicious payloads. Overall, the code seems intended for legitimate purposes, with no anomalies suggesting malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no indication of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is standard, with no suspicious patterns or malicious payloads detected. Confidence in this assessment is high.",
