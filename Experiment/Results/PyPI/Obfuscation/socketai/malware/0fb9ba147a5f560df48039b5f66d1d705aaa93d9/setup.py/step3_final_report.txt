{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information (login name, hostname, platform details, local IP address), encodes it in base64, and exfiltrates it via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external IP address during package setup, without user consent.",
  "sources": "Functions reading system info (os.getlogin(), platform.node(), platform.platform(), socket connection for IP), and the base64 encoding step.",
  "sinks": "HTTP GET request to 'http://127.70.159.15:60006/?token=...' with the encoded data, executed during import.",
  "flows": "System info functions → base64 encoding → HTTP request to external IP, triggered during package setup.",
  "anomalies": "Automatic data exfiltration during import, use of obfuscated function names, communication with a non-standard IP address, no user consent, embedded in setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers system info and covertly transmits it to an external IP address during package installation, indicating malicious intent. The obfuscation of function names and the use of a suspicious IP address support malicious behavior. The exfiltration occurs without user awareness, constituting privacy invasion. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.8-0.9, security risk ~0.8-0.9, obfuscation ~0.6-0.8) are consistent with this behavior. Given the covert data collection and transmission, the overall maliciousness is high.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs covert system info exfiltration to a suspicious IP during package setup, demonstrating malicious behavior. The high malware and security risk scores are justified. It should be flagged as highly malicious, and its distribution should be halted.",
