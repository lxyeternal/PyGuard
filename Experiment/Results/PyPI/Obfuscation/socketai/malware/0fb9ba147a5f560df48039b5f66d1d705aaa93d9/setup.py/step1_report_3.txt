  "purpose": "The code appears to gather system information, encode it, and send it to a remote server; also sets up a Python package configuration.",
  "sources": "os.getlogin(), platform.node(), platform.platform(), socket connection to external IP, base64 encoding, and reading 'README.md' file.",
  "sinks": "OBQPnQTTjLEycyjQtkzHJvVnrXxBfiQE function which sends data over HTTP to an external IP address.",
  "flows": "System info is collected and encoded, then sent via HTTP request to 'http://127.70.159.15:60006/?token='.",
  "anomalies": "The code collects system info and transmits it to a remote IP without any user consent or indication; the URL used appears suspicious and unrelated to legitimate package distribution. The data flow from system info collection to external transmission is covert and not disclosed as part of package functionality.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers system information such as login name, hostname, platform details, and local IP address. It encodes this information in base64 with some prefix and sends it to a hardcoded external IP address via HTTP GET request. The setup function is standard for Python packaging, but the embedded system info collection and network transmission are unusual for a package setup script. The external IP and the nature of data collection suggest potential malicious intent, such as data exfiltration. The code uses common libraries but repurposes them for covert data transmission. The presence of an external request to a suspicious IP indicates malicious behavior rather than benign functionality.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting detailed system info and sending it to a remote server without user consent, indicative of data exfiltration. Although it is embedded within a package setup script, the core logic is covert and suspicious. The overall security risk is high, and the code should be considered malicious.",
