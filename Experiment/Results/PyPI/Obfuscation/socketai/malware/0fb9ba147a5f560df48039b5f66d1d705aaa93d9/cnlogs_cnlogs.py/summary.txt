  "conclusion": "The dependency exhibits low risk overall, with specific concern around obfuscation and dynamic code execution in certain reports. The scores are appropriate and justified based on the evidence. Slight score increases for malware suspicion in obfuscated cases could be considered if further analysis reveals hidden malicious activity. Dynamic analysis and deobfuscation are recommended for definitive assessment."
