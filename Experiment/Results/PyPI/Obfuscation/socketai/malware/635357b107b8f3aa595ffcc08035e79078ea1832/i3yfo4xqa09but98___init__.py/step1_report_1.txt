  "sinks": "There are no identifiable sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects, such as system calls, network transmissions, or data writes.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present due to the absence of code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns are present, as no code is provided.",
  "analysis": "The review is limited by the lack of any code content. No suspicious behavior, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are detectable without code input.",
