  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, imported modules, external libraries, network calls, file operations.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission, file writes, environment variable access, output functions.",
  "flows": "Sources to sinks via code execution paths, data handling, and API calls.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads. Data flows from sources such as environment variables or user input to sinks like network or file operations are standard and benign. No anomalies or suspicious constructs are present. The security risk is minimal, and malware likelihood is negligible. Confidence in this assessment is high due to the lack of suspicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency code appears benign with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities detected. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
