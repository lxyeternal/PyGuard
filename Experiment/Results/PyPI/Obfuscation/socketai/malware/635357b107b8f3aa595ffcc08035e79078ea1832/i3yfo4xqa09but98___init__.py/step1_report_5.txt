  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be a standard Python script, potentially for data processing or utility functions, but without additional context, its specific goal is unclear.",
  "sources": "Data inputs are not explicitly defined; the code does not read from files, environment variables, or user inputs directly.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system commands are present that handle untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No identifiable flow from untrusted sources to sinks is observed; the code mainly performs calculations and variable assignments.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains straightforward calculations; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are detected. There are no dynamic eval or exec calls, no unusual variable names, or unnecessary complexity.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple variable definitions and arithmetic operations. There are no external data sources, network operations, or system modifications. The structure is basic, and no malicious or suspicious patterns are present. Due to lack of external inputs or outputs, the risk of malicious activity is minimal.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign and straightforward with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
