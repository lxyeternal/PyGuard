{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package and includes an attempt to execute a hidden PowerShell command, likely for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads file existence via os.path.exists and attempts to execute a PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen executes a PowerShell encoded command, which can lead to remote code execution or other malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The code checks for the existence of a file; if not present, it runs a PowerShell command in a hidden window, potentially executing malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "The embedded PowerShell command is encoded and executed silently; no explanation or validation of the command is provided. Use of try-except blocks suppresses errors, hiding potential issues.",
  "analysis": "The script imports distutils for package setup, which is benign. However, it then attempts to run a PowerShell command encoded in Base64 or similar encoding, hidden from user view, which is suspicious. The command's purpose is unclear but could be malicious. The code suppresses errors, preventing detection of failures. Overall, the core malicious activity is the silent execution of an encoded PowerShell script, a common technique in malware to evade detection.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious intent by executing an encoded PowerShell command without user awareness, indicating likely malicious behavior. The setup function is benign, but the hidden command execution is suspicious and potentially dangerous.",
