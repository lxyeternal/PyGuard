{
  "purpose": "The code appears to collect system information and send it to a remote server during installation, potentially for monitoring or malicious data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Reading '/proc/uptime', collecting platform info via platform and psutil, and socket connection to a remote IP address.",
  "sinks": "Socket connection to '134.209.85.64' on port 9090 and sending encoded system info data.",
  "flows": "System info is gathered from system files and modules, then concatenated and sent over an untrusted network socket to the specified remote IP address.",
  "anomalies": "The code reads system uptime, gathers detailed system info, and immediately transmits this data to an external server without user consent or transparency. The remote IP address is hardcoded, and the purpose of data transmission is not disclosed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports system and network modules, then defines a function that retrieves system uptime from '/proc/uptime', formats it, and collects system info such as OS version and network interfaces. It then opens a socket connection to a hardcoded IP and port, transmitting the collected data. During setup, a custom install class executes this function during installation, causing system info to be sent automatically when the package is installed. The behavior resembles data exfiltration or potential surveillance, especially given the lack of user notification and the remote server connection.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains code that transmits system information to an external server during installation, which is suspicious and potentially malicious, indicating possible data exfiltration or surveillance activity. The code is straightforward but exhibits malicious intent in its silent data transmission.",
