{
  "purpose": "The code appears to collect system information and send it to a remote server during installation, possibly for reconnaissance or data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Reads from '/proc/uptime' for system uptime, gathers system info via platform and psutil modules, and reads no other external inputs.",
  "sinks": "Establishes a socket connection to IP 134.209.85.64 on port 9090 and sends system info data.",
  "flows": "Collects uptime and system details -> formats data -> sends over network socket to external IP during package installation.",
  "anomalies": "Code executes network communication during setup, which is unusual for typical setup scripts. The remote IP and port are hardcoded. The code reads system info and transmits it silently during install, indicating potential spying or data collection behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a function that reads system uptime and gathers system info. It then formats this data and opens a socket connection to a specific IP address, sending the information. This behavior occurs during the installation process, triggered by a custom 'install' class that overrides the 'run' method. The code does not sanitize or verify data sources and uses hardcoded IP/port, which suggests malicious intent or at least covert data exfiltration. The code does not use external inputs or user data but secretly transmits system info to an external server.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior by collecting system information and sending it to a remote server during installation, indicating potential malicious activity such as system reconnaissance or data exfiltration. No benign reason for this behavior is evident, and it fits typical patterns of malware or backdoor code in supply chain contexts.",
