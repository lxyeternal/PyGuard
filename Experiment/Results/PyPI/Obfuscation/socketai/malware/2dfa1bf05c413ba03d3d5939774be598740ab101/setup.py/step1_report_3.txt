  "purpose": "Collect system uptime and hardware details, then send this information to a remote server during installation.",
  "sources": "File '/proc/uptime' for system uptime, platform and psutil for system info, network socket for data transmission.",
  "sinks": "Socket connection to '134.209.85.64' on port 9090 where data is sent.",
  "flows": "Read system uptime and info -> Format data -> Send over socket to remote IP during package installation.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual practice of transmitting system info to an external server during package install, hardcoded IP and port, obfuscated function and variable names, no validation or encryption of data sent.",
  "analysis": "The code reads system uptime from '/proc/uptime' and gathers system info such as OS details and network interfaces using platform and psutil. It formats this data and establishes a TCP socket connection to a hardcoded external IP address and port, then transmits the collected data. This behavior occurs during the installation process via a custom setup command. The remote connection and data exfiltration without user consent is suspicious. The obfuscated function and variable names suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent. No user input is processed, and no data received from the user is handled.",
  "conclusion": "The code secretly gathers system information and exfiltrates it to an external IP during installation, which is suspicious behavior consistent with data collection or malicious surveillance. The connection to an external IP without disclosure poses security and privacy risks.",
