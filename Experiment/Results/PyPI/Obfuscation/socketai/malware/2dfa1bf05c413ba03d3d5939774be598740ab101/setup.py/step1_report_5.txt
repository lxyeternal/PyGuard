{
  "purpose": "The code appears to gather system information, uptime, and network details, then send this data to a remote server during installation.",
  "sources": "Reads '/proc/uptime' for system uptime, platform module for OS details, psutil for network info, and socket for network communication.",
  "sinks": "Socket connection to '134.209.85.64' on port 9090 where data is sent, which could be used to exfiltrate collected information.",
  "flows": "System info and uptime are gathered from sources and then sent over the socket connection to the remote IP.",
  "anomalies": "The code connects to an external IP address during package installation, which is suspicious. It also reads '/proc/uptime' and system info, possibly to profile the system for malicious purposes. The variable naming is obfuscated, indicating an attempt to hide intent. The code attempts to send system data without user consent, during the installation process.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a function that collects system uptime and information, then establishes a socket connection to a remote server and transmits this data. The collection of system info and uptime, combined with automatic data exfiltration during package install, is suspicious. Obfuscated variable names and the network activity during setup suggest malicious intent or at least malicious behavior. The code does not include any form of user consent, logging, or transparency. No other libraries or dependencies are used maliciously; the focus is on data collection and transfer.",
  "conclusion": "This code demonstrates potentially malicious behavior by collecting detailed system info and sending it to an external IP address during installation, which could be used for tracking, profiling, or other malicious purposes. The obfuscation and network activity increase suspicion of malicious intent.",
