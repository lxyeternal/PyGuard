{
  "purpose": "The code collects system uptime and system information, then exfiltrates this data to an external server during package installation, likely for malicious surveillance or data theft.",
  "sources": "Reading '/proc/uptime', gathering system info via 'platform' and 'psutil', and during the execution of the custom install class.",
  "sinks": "Socket connection to IP '134.209.85.64' on port 9090 where data is sent without user consent.",
  "flows": "System info is read from sources, processed into a string, and transmitted over the socket connection during the install process.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded external IP and port, obfuscated function and variable names, data exfiltration during package installation without user notification.",
  "analysis": "The code performs system info collection and covertly transmits it to an external server during package installation, which is atypical for benign setup scripts. The obfuscated naming and hardcoded IP suggest malicious intent. The data flow from system info sources to network sink indicates potential backdoor activity. The high obfuscation score reflects deliberate concealment. The behavior aligns with malware patterns, specifically covert data exfiltration. The high security risk score is justified due to the potential for privacy invasion and supply chain compromise.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior by silently collecting and exfiltrating system information during installation, with obfuscation and hardcoded C2 communication. It should be considered high risk and potentially malicious, warranting removal or further investigation.",
