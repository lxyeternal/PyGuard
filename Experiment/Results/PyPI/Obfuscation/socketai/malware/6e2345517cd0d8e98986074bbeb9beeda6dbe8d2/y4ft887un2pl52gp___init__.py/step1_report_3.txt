{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script performing data processing and network requests, possibly for data collection or API interaction.",
  "sources": "Reads data from environment variables, input functions, and external modules; also fetches data over network connections.",
  "sinks": "Network socket connections, data output to files or console, use of environment variables.",
  "flows": "Input from environment or user -> processed by code -> sent over network or stored locally.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious network domains detected; code structure appears straightforward. No obfuscated code or unusual language features found.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes variables from environment variables and user input, performs data processing, and makes network requests. It does not contain any obvious malicious actions such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or system modification. Usage of external modules seems standard. No hidden backdoors or suspicious behaviors identified. The overall structure and behavior are consistent with legitimate purposes, although the intent cannot be fully confirmed without external context.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign and intended for routine data handling and network communication. Confidence in this assessment is high; no obfuscation or malware signals detected.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
