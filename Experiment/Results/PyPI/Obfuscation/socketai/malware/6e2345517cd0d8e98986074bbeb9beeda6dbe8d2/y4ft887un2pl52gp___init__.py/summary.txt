  "conclusion": "Most reports correctly identify the absence of malicious activity in minimal or missing code. The heavily obfuscated code (report 5) is appropriately scored with high obfuscation (0.8), moderate malware potential (0.6), and high security risk (0.75). The overall scoring aligns with the evidence, and no adjustments are necessary at this stage."
