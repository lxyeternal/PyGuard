{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple script intended to process user input and perform a calculation or display output based on it.",
  "sources": "Input is read from the 'input()' function, likely from the user via the console.",
  "sinks": "The output is sent to the console using 'print()'. There are no other evident sinks that could leak data or execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "User input flows into the variables and is processed through mathematical operations, then outputted. No data is sent over the network or stored externally.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious imports, or unusual code constructs. The code appears straightforward with no obfuscation, backdoors, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code reads user input, processes it mathematically, and displays the result. There are no external data sources, no use of environment variables, and no dynamic code execution. It lacks features typically associated with malicious activities such as data exfiltration, command injection, or network communication. The structure is simple, and the purpose seems benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or supply chain security risks. The code appears safe and performs a basic computational task without any malicious intent.",
