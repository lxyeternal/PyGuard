{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package with versioning and classification metadata. Additionally, it attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command if a specific directory does not exist.",
  "sources": "The code reads the filesystem (os.path.exists) and attempts to execute a subprocess (subprocess.Popen) with a PowerShell command.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen executes a PowerShell command, which could be used to run arbitrary code or malicious scripts.",
  "flows": "If the directory 'tahg' does not exist, the code initiates a subprocess that runs a hidden PowerShell command, potentially executing malicious payloads.",
  "anomalies": "The PowerShell command is encoded in base64 and executed with hidden window style; the purpose of the command is obfuscated. The command seems to download or run external scripts from suspicious URLs. The use of broad try-except blocks suppresses errors, which could hide malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code's primary function is to perform package setup, but it includes a conditional block that executes an encoded PowerShell command if a directory does not exist. The encoded command suggests obfuscation, likely intended to conceal malicious activity. The command appears to download or execute content from external sources, which is a common tactic in supply chain attacks or malware delivery. The use of subprocess with hidden window flags and broad exception handling indicates potential malicious intent or at least malicious capabilities. Overall, the malicious behavior is covert and designed to be hidden during execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by executing an obfuscated PowerShell command that likely downloads or runs external malicious content when a specific directory is missing. This indicates a high risk of malicious intent hidden within seemingly benign package setup code.",
