{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple Python script that prints a greeting message to the console.",
  "sources": "No external input sources are present; the code does not read user input, environment variables, files, or network data.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs to the console via the print function.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows are present, as the script only executes a static print statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no suspicious imports, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, and no obfuscated sections. No hidden or unusual behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The script consists solely of a print statement that outputs a greeting. There are no sources of external data, no sinks that handle untrusted input, and no flows between them. The code structure is simple, and no anomalies such as obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious imports are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign and standard Python script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is highly unlikely to contain malware or pose a security threat.",
