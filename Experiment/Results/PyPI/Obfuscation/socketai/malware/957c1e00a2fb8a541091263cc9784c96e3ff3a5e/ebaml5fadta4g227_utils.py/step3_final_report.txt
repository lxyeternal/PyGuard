  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code input, environment variables, network calls, file operations, dynamic execution points.",
  "sinks": "Network transmissions, file modifications, environment variable access, system commands.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or inputs flow into network or system functions, potentially leading to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation techniques, dynamic code execution, encoded strings, suspicious control flow, hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code shows significant obfuscation with encoded strings and dynamic execution, indicating potential malicious intent. No explicit malicious payloads are confirmed, but the obfuscation and suspicious patterns justify cautious suspicion. The code's benign parts are standard, with no hardcoded credentials or suspicious system calls. The suspicion level warrants a moderate malware score and security risk, with high obfuscation scores reflecting the obfuscation techniques used. Overall, the code's structure and signals suggest a potential threat, but lack of confirmed malicious payloads keeps the scores moderate.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits obfuscation and suspicious patterns without confirmed malicious payloads. The risk is moderate, and the obfuscation techniques justify a higher obfuscated score. The overall malware risk remains cautious but not definitive of malicious intent.",
