  "purpose": "The code outputs a message indicating the system has been compromised or 'pwned'.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are used; only a static print statement.",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs to standard output; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flows from any source to a sink; the code executes a static output command.",
  "anomalies": "The code is extremely simple and contains no complex logic or suspicious behavior. The message may be intended as a joke or threat, but that is not malicious per se.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a single print statement that outputs a message to the console. It does not read input, access environment variables, or perform any network operations. There are no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation, and no suspicious constructs. The message itself does not indicate malicious intent, but rather a trivial or provocative output. No anomalies or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It simply prints a message and does not perform any harmful actions.",
