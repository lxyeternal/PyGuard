  "purpose": "Outputs a static message indicating a security breach or compromise.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the print statement is static.",
  "anomalies": "The message 'You are pwned' is provocative but not malicious; no suspicious code or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward print statement with no inputs, external interactions, or malicious constructs. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The message's provocative tone does not imply malicious intent. Malware score is 0; obfuscated score is 0; security risk score is most appropriately 0, though some reports assign 0.1, which is acceptable but slightly overstates the risk given the code's simplicity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The provocative message does not constitute a security threat. Scores should reflect zero malware, zero obfuscation, and zero security risk.",
