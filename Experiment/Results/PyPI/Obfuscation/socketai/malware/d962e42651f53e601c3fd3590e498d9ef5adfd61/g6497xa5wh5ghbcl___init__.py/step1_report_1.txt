  "purpose": "The code outputs a message indicating a security breach or compromise.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; only static print statement.",
  "sinks": "Console output, which could be used for user notification or harassment.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data processing present.",
  "anomalies": "The message itself is potentially provocative or malicious in intent, but the code behavior is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a print statement that outputs a static string 'You are pwned'. There are no inputs, no data processing, no external communications, and no suspicious code constructs. The message could be considered malicious if used in a malicious context, but technically, the code is simple and benign.",
  "conclusion": "This is a minimal, non-malicious script that outputs a message. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
