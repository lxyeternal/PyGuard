  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Dynamic execution functions (eval, exec), hardcoded URLs/credentials, import statements, environment variables, data flows from input sources.",
  "sinks": "Potential data exfiltration points, network communication, system modifications, dynamic code execution paths.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input data or environment variables leading to sinks like eval/exec or network functions, possibly via obfuscated variables or complex logic.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec with untrusted input, hardcoded external references, high obfuscation, complex or cryptic code structures, placeholders with no code.",
  "analysis": "Report 1 lacks code, appropriately scoring low risk; Report 2 shows suspicious patterns including dynamic execution, obfuscation, and hardcoded references, justifying high malware (0.75), obfuscated (0.8), and risk (0.8) scores; Report 3 is benign with straightforward code, scoring minimal; Report 4 contains dynamic execution and obfuscation, indicating potential malicious intent, with scores of malware=0.3, obfuscated=0.7, risk=0.65, but considering the patterns, increasing malware to 0.5 is justified; Report 5 is empty or placeholder code, scoring zero across malware and obfuscation, with low risk. Overall, the most suspicious code patterns are in reports 2 and 4, with the latter warranting a slight score increase. The scores are consistent with the described behaviors, but further code review is recommended for confirmation.",
  "conclusion": "The analysis indicates that Report 2 presents a high likelihood of malicious activity, justified by suspicious patterns like eval/exec and obfuscation. Report 4 also shows concerning patterns but with moderate scores; increasing its malware score to 0.5 improves accuracy. Other reports are benign or lack sufficient code to suggest malicious intent. Overall, the supply chain risk is moderate to high primarily due to reports 2 and 4, with scores adjusted to reflect observed behaviors.",
