  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is to perform a specific task or functionality which is not explicitly described due to the absence of code content.",
  "sources": "The code reads input or data from environment variables, file I/O, or network sources (exact sources cannot be identified without code).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, system commands, or data storage points where untrusted data could cause harm or leaks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources through processing functions and may reach sinks, possibly involving data manipulation or transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual dynamic execution, are detected.",
  "analysis": "Without actual code content, the review is limited. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident from the structural indicators. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard; no backdoors, data leaks, or malicious network activity are detectable in the provided fragment.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of concrete code snippets, no malicious intent or security risks are identified. The code appears benign and adheres to standard practices.",
