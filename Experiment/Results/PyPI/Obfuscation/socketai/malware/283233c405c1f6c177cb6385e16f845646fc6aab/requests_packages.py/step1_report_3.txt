{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for performing data processing or utility functions, possibly involving network operations or system interactions.",
  "sources": "Potential data sources include input functions, environment variables, or network requests (if present). Since no explicit input functions or data sources are shown in the provided snippet, sources are assumed to be minimal or indirect.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, system commands, or subprocess executions. No explicit sinks are clearly visible in the snippet provided.",
  "flows": "Without specific input or output functions shown, flow analysis is limited. Typically, flow would involve untrusted input reaching sensitive functions like network or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No clear anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic execution are evident in this code snippet. The code appears straightforward and lacks obfuscation or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and straightforward, lacking signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. No suspicious variables, imports, or operations are present. The absence of explicit data sources or sinks makes it unlikely to contain malicious flows. However, since the snippet is small, some malicious intent might be concealed elsewhere, but based on the provided code, risks seem minimal.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code does not show any signs of malware, malicious behavior, or significant security risks. It appears to be benign with no obvious security issues. Due to limited context, confidence is moderate; more code would provide a clearer picture.",
  "confidence": 0.7,
  "obfuscated": 0,
