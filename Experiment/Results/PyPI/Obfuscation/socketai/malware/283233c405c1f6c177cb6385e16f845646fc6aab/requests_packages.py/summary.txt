  "conclusion": "The analysis indicates that Report 2 presents a high likelihood of malicious activity, justified by suspicious patterns like eval/exec and obfuscation. Report 4 also shows concerning patterns but with moderate scores; increasing its malware score to 0.5 improves accuracy. Other reports are benign or lack sufficient code to suggest malicious intent. Overall, the supply chain risk is moderate to high primarily due to reports 2 and 4, with scores adjusted to reflect observed behaviors."
