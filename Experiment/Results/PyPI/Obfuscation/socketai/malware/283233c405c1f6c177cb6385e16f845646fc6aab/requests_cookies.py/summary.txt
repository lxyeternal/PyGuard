  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, albeit heavily obfuscated, compatibility utility for cookie management. There is no direct evidence of malware or malicious behavior. The obfuscation warrants caution, but the overall assessment indicates a low security threat. Further review of the entire package is recommended to ensure no hidden malicious logic."
