{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple utility for computing and printing the MD5 hash of a file specified by the user.",
  "sources": "User input via the command line argument 'sys.argv[1]'.",
  "sinks": "The hashlib library's md5 function and print statement outputting the hash.",
  "flows": "User provides a filename -> file is opened and read -> MD5 hash is computed -> hash is printed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. Uses standard libraries without obfuscation or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries (sys, hashlib), retrieves a filename from command line arguments, opens the specified file in binary mode, computes its MD5 hash, and outputs the hash. No external or untrusted data sources are involved besides user input. No malicious activities such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code injection are present. The code performs a common hashing task with no security issues or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility to generate an MD5 hash of a given file. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The script is simple, clear, and safe.",
