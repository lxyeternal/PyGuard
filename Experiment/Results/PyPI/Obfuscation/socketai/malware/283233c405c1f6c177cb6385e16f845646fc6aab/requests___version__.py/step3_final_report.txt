  "purpose": "Analyze open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code content, data flows, anomalies, and obfuscation.",
  "sources": "Input data from user input, environment variables, files, or network connections.",
  "sinks": "Output to console, files, network, or system commands; potential data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) through processing functions to sinks (outputs), possibly involving untrusted data paths.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or unusual dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward MD5 hashing utility that reads a filename from command line, hashes the file, and prints the hash. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The data flow is simple and standard, with no anomalies detected. Given the benign purpose and standard library usage, the code poses minimal security risk. No hardcoded secrets or malicious activities are identified. The overall confidence in benignity is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard MD5 hashing utility with no malicious intent or security issues. The security risk is minimal, and the malware likelihood is zero. The code does not exhibit obfuscation. The assigned scores are consistent with the analysis.",
