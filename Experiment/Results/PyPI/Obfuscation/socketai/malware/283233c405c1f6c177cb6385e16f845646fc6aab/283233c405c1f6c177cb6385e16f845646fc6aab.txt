      "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated with suspicious import and class names, indicating potential concealment of malicious behavior. However, no concrete malicious activity such as data exfiltration or backdoors is evident. The high obfuscation level and complex flow suggest caution. The malware score is set at 0.2, and the security risk at 0.3, reflecting moderate suspicion primarily due to obfuscation. Further dynamic analysis is recommended before deployment."

The obfuscation warrants caution, but the overall assessment indicates a low security threat. Further review of the entire package is recommended to ensure no hidden malicious logic."

The malware score is low overall, with a slight increase for Report 4. Obfuscation scores are moderate to high, especially in Reports 4 and 5. Security risk remains low but should be monitored due to obfuscation potential."

      "conclusion": "The analysis indicates that Report 2 presents a high likelihood of malicious activity, justified by suspicious patterns like eval/exec and obfuscation. Report 4 also shows concerning patterns but with moderate scores; increasing its malware score to 0.5 improves accuracy. Other reports are benign or lack sufficient code to suggest malicious intent. Overall, the supply chain risk is moderate to high primarily due to reports 2 and 4, with scores adjusted to reflect observed behaviors."
