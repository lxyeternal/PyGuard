{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define multiple custom exception classes, some inheriting from standard exceptions, with obfuscated class names and class attributes, potentially for error handling or to conceal malicious activity.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from imported modules and class attributes; potential data sources include imported modules and class variables.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network calls, file writes, or data exfiltration are evident; the code primarily defines classes and constants.",
  "flows": "No clear source-to-sink data flows; class attribute assignments do not involve untrusted data handling or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class names and attributes (e.g., 'hifqmZTFaOHgjldHbwGEPxwXzdkmhgSM', 'osSGQjMefQYAQjmQfraTpBpmtfwMwCiZ') hinder understanding; inheritance from standard exceptions mixed with obfuscated classes may serve to conceal malicious logic. The code contains no functional logic or external interactions, raising suspicion of hiding malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes with intentionally obfuscated names and attributes, inheriting from standard exceptions and other obfuscated classes. The use of obfuscation appears designed to hide the true purpose, potentially to evade detection. There are no obvious data flows or external calls, but the obfuscation and class structure may conceal malicious behavior, such as hidden backdoors or malicious error handling. The absence of functional logic reduces the certainty, but the obfuscation itself is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated with classes and attribute names that do not convey clear purpose. It does not perform any explicit malicious actions within the provided snippet but raises suspicion due to obfuscation patterns typical of malicious concealment. Without additional context, the risk remains uncertain but potentially high due to obfuscation and atypical structure.",
