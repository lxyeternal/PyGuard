{
  "purpose": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes with obfuscated names and static string attributes, inheriting from standard and third-party exceptions, with no active logic or external interactions.",
  "sources": "Import statements with obfuscated module names; class attribute assignments; class inheritance from standard exceptions.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data flows, network calls, or system modifications present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code consists solely of class definitions and attribute initializations.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of class names, attribute names, and import identifiers; lack of functional logic; nonsensical string constants used as class attributes.",
  "analysis": "The code is heavily obfuscated, with class hierarchies mainly for exception handling, and no evidence of malicious actions such as network activity, data exfiltration, or system modification. The obfuscation pattern suggests concealment but does not confirm malicious intent. The import statements with nonsensical names could be benign or maliciously renamed modules. Overall, the code appears to be a set of obfuscated exception class definitions, possibly for concealment or obfuscation purposes, but lacking active malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated but does not demonstrate any active malicious activity or security-threatening behavior. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware and security risk scores should remain low. The overall threat level is minimal based on this snippet, though caution is advised if further context reveals hidden behaviors.",
