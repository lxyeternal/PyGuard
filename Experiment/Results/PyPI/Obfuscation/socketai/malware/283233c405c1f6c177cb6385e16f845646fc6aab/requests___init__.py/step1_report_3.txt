  "purpose": "Description and usage examples of the Requests HTTP library in Python.",
  "sources": "Reads from standard input/output for usage instructions; no direct data input sources in code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data flows into potentially harmful operations; primarily documentation and example code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is mostly explanatory text and function calls with static URLs and parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious activities. The examples include standard requests usage.",
  "analysis": "The code is a documentation snippet for the Requests library, demonstrating GET and POST requests. It contains typical usage patterns, including importing the requests module, making GET requests to 'https://www.python.org', and POST requests with payloads to 'https://httpbin.org/post'. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or malicious behavior. The included code appears standard and intended for educational or illustrative purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign documentation example demonstrating the Requests library functionality. No malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks are identified.",
