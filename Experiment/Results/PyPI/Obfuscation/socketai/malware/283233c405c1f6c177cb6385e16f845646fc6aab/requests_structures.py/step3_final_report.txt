{
  "purpose": "Internal data management with obfuscated class names, handling key-value pairs in custom data structures.",
  "sources": "Reading class instantiations, method calls for data storage and retrieval within the classes.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; no network, file, or system calls present.",
  "flows": "Data stored in internal OrderedDict; key normalization to lowercase; retrieval and update methods operate on this store.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names; no validation or sanitization; no external data sources or sinks; no dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes: one a custom mutable mapping with internal OrderedDict storage, and another a dict subclass with a 'name' attribute. The mapping class uses case-insensitive keys and stores tuples of original key and value. No external system calls, network activity, or malicious code are present. The obfuscation of names suggests proprietary or proprietary-like code, but the logic itself is benign, managing internal data structures without side effects or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be utility classes for internal data handling, with high obfuscation but no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The malware score is 0, and the risk score is low (~0.2), primarily due to obfuscation. No active threats are detected based on this snippet.",
