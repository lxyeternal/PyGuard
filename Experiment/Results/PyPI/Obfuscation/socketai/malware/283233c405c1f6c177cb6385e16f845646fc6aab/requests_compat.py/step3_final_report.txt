  "purpose": "Environment detection, optional dependency imports, and type alias definitions with obfuscated variable names, likely for compatibility or concealment.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, import statements, variable assignments, import fallback mechanisms",
  "sinks": "None detected; no network, data leaks, or code execution observed",
  "flows": "Initialization and import setup without active data or network flow",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, suspicious import 'IXCASletKDPCujGbVkRXZvceIzOYreWD' from urllib.request, redundant redefinitions of 'str' and 'bytes'",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment detection and conditional imports, with obfuscated variable names and an unusual import from urllib.request. No network activity, data exfiltration, or code execution is evident. The suspicious import is not a standard Python component, raising suspicion but could be placeholder or obfuscation. The obfuscation appears to serve concealment or compatibility purposes rather than malicious intent. Scores assigned in the reports—malware=0, obfuscated around 0.4-0.7, low risk—are consistent with the observed benign setup and obfuscation level.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily environment setup with obfuscation. No evidence of malicious activity or security threat is present. The suspicious import warrants further review but does not indicate malicious intent based on this fragment.",
