{
  "purpose": "The code implements an HTTP request/response handling library with URL parsing, request preparation, cookie management, and response streaming.",
  "sources": "URL input, request parameters, headers, cookies, and response stream reading.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted URL components, request headers, and streamed response data.",
  "flows": "Input URL and request data flow through URL parsing, request building, cookie handling, and response processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with nonsensical import names, obscure exception class names, and complex control flow designed to conceal intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a complex HTTP client with functions for URL parsing, request preparation, cookie management, and response streaming. Obfuscated identifiers and strange import aliases suggest an attempt to conceal the code's true purpose. No explicit malicious network activity, backdoors, or payloads are evident from static analysis. The heavy obfuscation and unusual naming conventions raise suspicion but do not confirm malicious intent. The code appears to be a legitimate but heavily obfuscated HTTP utility library, which could be used benignly or maliciously. The presence of suspicious import names and complex flow control warrants caution. The overall behavior does not include network connections to suspicious domains or data exfiltration, but the obfuscation alone is a concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated with suspicious import and class names, indicating potential concealment of malicious behavior. However, no concrete malicious activity such as data exfiltration or backdoors is evident. The high obfuscation level and complex flow suggest caution. The malware score is set at 0.2, and the security risk at 0.3, reflecting moderate suspicion primarily due to obfuscation. Further dynamic analysis is recommended before deployment.",
