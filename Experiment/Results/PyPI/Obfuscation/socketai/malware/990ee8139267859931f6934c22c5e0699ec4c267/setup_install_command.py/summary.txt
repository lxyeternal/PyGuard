  "conclusion": "The code exhibits highly suspicious behavior indicative of malicious activity, specifically data exfiltration during package installation. The obfuscation and network activity reinforce this assessment. The scores in the reports are appropriate; I would slightly increase the malware and risk scores to reflect the severity of the exfiltration pattern."
