{
  "purpose": "Custom install class that attempts to gather environment variables, encode them, and send data over the network during installation.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables via os.environ.copy() in the constructor.",
  "sinks": "Sends data over the network using urllib.request.urlopen in the method dxaIfPoMEAjJCYjItAJgcrGkXPdLVOIn.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are collected and encoded during initialization, then sent via a network request in the method.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names, dynamic URL construction with undefined variables (h, c, o, f), and a method call to an unknown class or function 'UjQdJAoTPxoTpHQGuvZhqvdYYquRTzxo' suggest suspicious activity. The code attempts to exfiltrate environment data.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that inherits from setuptools.command.install. During initialization, it attempts to read environment variables and encode them with an obscure function, likely to obfuscate the data. The method dxaIfPoMEAjJCYjItAJgcrGkXPdLVOIn constructs a URL with undefined variables, making it non-functional as-is, but intended for data exfiltration. The network request sends the encoded environment data, indicating potential malicious behavior such as data theft or privacy invasion. The obfuscation and unclear URL components increase suspicion. The code appears to be designed to secretly collect and transmit environment data during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits suspicious behavior by collecting environment variables and attempting to send them over the network during installation, indicating potential data exfiltration or malicious activity. Obfuscation and undefined variables suggest an intent to conceal malicious operations.",
