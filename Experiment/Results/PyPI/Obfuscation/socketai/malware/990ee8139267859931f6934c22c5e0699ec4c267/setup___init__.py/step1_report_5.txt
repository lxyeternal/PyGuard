  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'randrange' Python package and set custom install command.",
  "sources": "Import statement for setup.install_command; dictionary containing package metadata and custom command class assignment.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no use of untrusted input, environment variables, or insecure functions.",
  "flows": "Import of setup.install_command -> assignment of dictionary with metadata and custom install command.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a non-descriptive variable name 'pLBMqNgOQSBgaWzqbvlbSKjrEznmAmBe', possibly obfuscated or auto-generated; use of a custom install command class from 'setup.install_command.outXqmIchTMvFlpYGAYLmGsUwPuEGPCA'. No code executing untrusted input or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module 'setup.install_command' and assigns a dictionary containing package metadata such as name, version, description, URL, author, keywords, license, and extra requirements. It also assigns a custom command class for installation, referencing a potentially obfuscated attribute 'outXqmIchTMvFlpYGAYLmGsUwPuEGPCA' from 'setup.install_command'. The variable name used is non-descriptive, which could be a sign of obfuscation, but this alone is not malicious. There is no evidence of code injection, network activity, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior. The code appears to be standard setup configuration with an unusual variable name.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup configuration with an unusual variable name that might suggest obfuscation. There are no indicators of malicious activity, malware, or security risks within this snippet.",
