{
  "purpose": "Generate a colored CLI display or report using obfuscated module attributes and static data.",
  "sources": "Internal module attributes, static lists, and dictionaries; no external untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "Writes formatted, colored output to sys.stdout or a similar stream object.",
  "flows": "Data flows from imported module attributes and internal lists into formatted output streams, with complex attribute references and string formatting.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with nonsensical variable and module names; use of a non-standard output stream object; complex attribute lookups; no external input or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs lists of module attributes, applies color mappings, and outputs formatted colored text. Obfuscation appears intended to conceal intent but no malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or system modification is evident. The suspicious use of a non-standard output stream and heavy obfuscation suggest potential misuse, but without concrete malicious actions, the code is likely benign. The obfuscation and indirect data handling warrant a cautious approach, but no definitive malicious activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily an obfuscated CLI formatting utility with no clear malicious intent. The suspicion in report 5 regarding potential covert data exfiltration via the output stream is justified but not confirmed. Overall, the code appears benign, with obfuscation serving concealment or aesthetic purposes. The malware score should be low but slightly elevated in the suspicious case, and the security risk moderate due to obfuscation and potential misuse of the output stream.",
