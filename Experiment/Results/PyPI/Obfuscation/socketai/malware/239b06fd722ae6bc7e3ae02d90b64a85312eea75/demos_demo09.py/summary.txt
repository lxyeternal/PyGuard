  "conclusion": "The script is a heavily obfuscated terminal styling utility that does not exhibit any malicious activity. The obfuscation level is high, but it serves primarily to conceal simplicity rather than malicious intent. There is no evidence of malware, network activity, or system compromise. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score should be zero. The obfuscation score remains high due to the code's obscured nature."
