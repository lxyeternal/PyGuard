  "flows": "Reads __file__ to determine current script location → constructs parent directory path → inserts into sys.path",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable name (EQgeDldVikZeINboVdTfYhANYZWLtXlz) instead of a descriptive name, which may suggest an attempt to hide intent. No direct malicious activity observed, but obfuscated naming is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code calculates the parent directory of the current script using os.path functions. It then inserts this directory at the start of sys.path, which affects module import resolution order. The variable name used is intentionally obscure, which is uncommon in standard code and can be a red flag for hiding malicious intent or obfuscation. The operation itself is benign in typical scenarios, but the obfuscation warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code's core functionality is harmless—adding the parent directory to sys.path—but the use of an obfuscated variable name raises suspicion. No explicit malicious behavior is evident, but the obfuscation could be a sign of hiding malicious intentions or code insertion. Overall, this pattern is common in certain legitimate use cases but warrants cautious review.",
