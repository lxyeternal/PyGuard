  "purpose": "Adjusts the module search path by adding the parent directory of the current file to sys.path",
  "sources": "Reads the current file path (__file__), the directory of the current file, and the parent directory of that directory",
  "sinks": "Modifies sys.path, which influences module import behavior; potential to import malicious or unintended modules if path is compromised",
  "flows": "Uses __file__ to get current script location -> computes parent directory path -> inserts this path into sys.path for module importing",
  "anomalies": "Uses an obfuscated variable name (EQgeDldVikZeINboVdTfYhANYZWLtXlz); no hardcoded credentials or malicious functions evident",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically modifies sys.path to include the parent directory of the script, potentially to enable importing local modules or dependencies. The variable name used for the path is highly obfuscated, which can be a tactic to hide intent. No malicious code, network activity, or harmful behavior is present. The purpose appears benign, possibly for project structure management or module resolution.",
  "conclusion": "The code's primary function is to manipulate the import path dynamically, which is common in Python projects. While the obfuscated variable name is unusual, it does not inherently indicate malicious intent. No malware or security risks are evident from this snippet alone.",
