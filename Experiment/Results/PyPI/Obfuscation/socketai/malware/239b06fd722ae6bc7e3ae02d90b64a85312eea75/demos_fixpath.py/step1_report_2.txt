  "purpose": "Adjusts the Python module search path by adding a parent directory of the current file.",
  "sources": "Reads the current file's directory path via __file__, and constructs a parent directory path.",
  "sinks": "Modifies sys.path, which affects module import behavior.",
  "flows": "Reads __file__ to determine current script location → constructs a path to the parent directory → inserts this path into sys.path to influence module loading.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The code performs standard path manipulation and sys.path modification, which is common for package-relative imports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys and os.path functions. It constructs a normalized path to the parent directory of the current script and inserts it at the beginning of sys.path. This is a common technique to influence module import resolution. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution beyond standard path operations. No indication of malicious intent or malicious code. The code is straightforward and typical for package setup or relative imports.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard path manipulation and sys.path modification, which is a common practice in Python projects. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this snippet.",
