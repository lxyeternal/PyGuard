{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates the usage of the colorama library to print colored text with different reset behaviors (autoreset True/False).",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs to the console using print statements.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted input; the flow is static printing of predefined strings with color settings.",
  "anomalies": "The imported module 'colorama' is manipulated with obfuscated variable names. The use of functions from colorama (tKAzwuMRhZNBXVJSiTiqjMbRKGDGkdSV) and attributes from other obfuscated variables suggests unnecessary complexity or obfuscation. However, no code executes dynamically or injects untrusted code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports colorama functions with obfuscated names and uses them to set color resets for print statements. The variable names are unintelligible, which could indicate an attempt to hide intent, but they are simply references to standard colorama functions. No external input is processed, no user data is used, and there are no network operations, file manipulations, or system calls that could be malicious. The code's purpose appears benign: demonstrating colorama reset behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple demonstration of colorama's autoreset functionality with obfuscated variable names. There is no malicious intent, no malware, and no security risks identified. The obfuscation appears unnecessary but not malicious.",
