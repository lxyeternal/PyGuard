{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, with an embedded custom install command that performs malicious activities such as cloning repositories and modifying system files.",
  "sources": "os.getlogin(), os.environ, git.Git().clone(), os.listdir(), os.rename()",
  "sinks": "Cloning external repositories, creating directories in startup folder, renaming system files",
  "flows": "The code reads the current user login and environment variables, then clones malicious repositories into startup directories, potentially executing malicious scripts on system startup.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names, direct modification of startup folder, cloning from suspicious GitHub URLs, renaming of files in startup directories, no clear legitimate purpose for these actions, use of hardcoded paths with user input",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom installation command that manipulates system startup folders by creating directories and cloning repositories from GitHub. It moves a script 'test.py' into the startup folder, likely to execute on system boot. The code uses hardcoded Git URLs pointing to potentially malicious repositories. The obfuscated class and method names suggest an attempt to hide intent. These actions are typical of malware aiming for persistence and remote control.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior designed to compromise the host system, including persistence mechanisms and potential remote control via cloned repositories. The obfuscation and suspicious actions strongly indicate malicious intent.",
