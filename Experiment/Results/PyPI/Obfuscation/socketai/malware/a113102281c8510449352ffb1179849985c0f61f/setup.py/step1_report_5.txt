{
  "purpose": "This setup script installs dependencies and executes code that clones malicious repositories and manipulates startup files to persist malicious scripts.",
  "sources": "Code reads environment variables, system login info, filesystem paths, and network URLs for cloning repositories.",
  "sinks": "Cloning repositories from remote URLs, renaming files in startup directories, creating directories in startup paths, setting environment variables.",
  "flows": "The code uses system login info to construct paths, clones repositories from GitHub URLs into startup directories, and moves test.py into startup folders, potentially executing malicious code at startup.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual directory creation in startup folders, cloning repositories from suspicious URLs, renaming a script into startup directories, obfuscated class and method names, no legitimate project purpose, malicious intent indicated by persistence mechanisms.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing setup utilities and defines a class with obfuscated naming. The class's method sets an environment variable, then clones two GitHub repositories into startup directories, likely to ensure persistence. It then moves a 'test.py' script into the startup folder, which could be executed on system startup. The use of hardcoded URLs, directory manipulation, and hiding in startup folders strongly suggests malicious behavior aimed at persistence or remote control. The package dependencies include common libraries but are overshadowed by the malicious code behavior. Overall, the script's actions are typical of malware establishing persistence and potentially executing malicious payloads at system startup.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by setting environment variables, cloning repositories from suspicious sources, manipulating startup folders, and hiding scripts in startup directories. These actions are indicative of malware designed to persist and potentially execute malicious code on startup. The package appears to be a supply chain attack vector aiming to compromise systems upon installation.",
