      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing remote files without validation, wrapped within request functions to ensure persistent activation. The undefined 'executable' variable suggests obfuscation or incomplete code, but the core malicious pattern remains evident. The high scores assigned across malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified given the behavior. This code should be classified as highly malicious with a very high security threat level."

      "obfuscated": 0.8,
      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and potential malicious intent, primarily due to the suspicious import source, obfuscated variable names, and the presence of a 'delete' component that could be destructive. While no concrete malicious activity is confirmed, the pattern warrants caution and further investigation."
