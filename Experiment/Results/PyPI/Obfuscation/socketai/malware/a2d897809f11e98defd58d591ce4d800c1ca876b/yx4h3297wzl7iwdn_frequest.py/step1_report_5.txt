{
  "purpose": "The code appears to modify the behavior of HTTP request functions by injecting malicious activity, downloading and executing remote files, and potentially creating backdoors.",
  "sources": "Requests to 'http://35.235.126.33/all.txt' for configuration or command data, and dynamic URL requests to 'http://35.235.126.33/{executable}', where 'executable' is not defined within this snippet.",
  "sinks": "Downloading files and executing them via os.system, potentially running malicious payloads. Also, the function gUwceRHhAhubzZyeIMqdlzdPEilUOEIh is called recursively with different methods, which may be an obfuscated or malicious function.",
  "flows": "Code fetches configuration data from a remote server, then downloads files based on the configuration, saves them locally, makes them executable, and runs them in background processes depending on OS.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual function names, hardcoded URLs pointing to a suspicious IP, dynamic execution of downloaded files, and wrapping of all HTTP methods to inject this behavior into standard requests. Use of a non-standard function 'gUwceRHhAhubzZyeIMqdlzdPEilUOEIh' suggests obfuscation or malicious intent. The code ignores potential errors and lacks validation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that contacts a remote server to retrieve a list of target filenames, filtered by current OS. It then downloads files from the same server, saves, and executes them depending on the OS, indicating a potential backdoor or remote code execution. The request functions are wrapped to invoke this malicious function every time an HTTP method is called, thus possibly infecting all network requests made by the application. The code uses obfuscated function names and hardcoded IPs, typical in malicious scripts to evade detection. There is no evident security check or validation, increasing risk. Overall, the code is designed to stealthily download and run remote payloads, and it affects all HTTP interactions, indicating malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This script demonstrates malicious activity, including remote file download, execution, and potential backdoor installation, embedded within common request functions. The obfuscation and hardcoded URLs strongly suggest malicious intent, making this code dangerous and unsuitable for use.",
