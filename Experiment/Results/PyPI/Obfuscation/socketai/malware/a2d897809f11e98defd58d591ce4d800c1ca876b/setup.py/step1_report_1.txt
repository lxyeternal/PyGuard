{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'yx4h3297wzl7iwdn', primarily to install dependencies and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md for long description; static string assignments for package metadata and requirements.",
  "sinks": "No evident untrusted data sinks; no code executes external commands or handles user input.",
  "flows": "The script assigns static data to variables; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names (e.g., gbLvmbyGfNBVwfBahlGGxAkoLowzyfZh, HcdnmMcPWaELgrJDCXQEhYYxZzyxNUzV) that hinder readability; potential attempt to conceal intent. No actual code execution, injection, or dynamic evaluation observed. The 'setup' function uses parameters with values derived from static variables; no malicious actions detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs package setup using setuptools. It reads a README file to assign a long description. Package metadata is stored in variables with obfuscated names, which could be an attempt to conceal purpose but do not themselves perform malicious actions. The 'requires' list specifies dependencies. The setup() call constructs the package with these parameters, with no code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted inputs. The obfuscation appears superficial, possibly for code concealment, but no malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names but no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It functions as a typical package configuration file, with no active code that could harm or compromise systems.",
