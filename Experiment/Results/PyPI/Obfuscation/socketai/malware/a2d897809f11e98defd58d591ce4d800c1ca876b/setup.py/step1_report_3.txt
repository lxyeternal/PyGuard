  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, configuring package metadata, dependencies, and installation options.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file; defining package metadata and dependencies; calling setup() with configuration data.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks where untrusted data could be used maliciously; no network or file output based on untrusted input observed.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md -> defining metadata -> invoking setup() with package data and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names and encoding methods; use of obfuscated-like variable names such as 'gbLvmbyGfNBVwfBahlGGxAkoLowzyfZh' and 'ajZZnizpQQtpCFKNZLkEavpTDQJNjkOm'. No actual malicious code or external data flows detected; some variables appear intentionally obscure but serve typical setup functions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, importing 'setuptools', reading a README file, defining package metadata, dependencies, and invoking 'setup()'. Variable names are unusual but appear to serve as obfuscated labels rather than malicious code. No data flows indicate injection, exfiltration, or malicious behavior. No network activity or code injection mechanisms are present. The code does not process untrusted user input nor perform any suspicious operations beyond normal package setup procedures.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical package setup script with obfuscated variable names but no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The code primarily handles package metadata and configuration without any evident security risks or malware. The unusual variable naming does not translate into malicious intent.",
