{
  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script defining metadata, dependencies, and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md for long description; defines package metadata and dependencies; uses obfuscated variable names.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, code execution, or network activity detected.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "Heavily obfuscated variable names; presence of a suspicious key 'FfoFvWyFjNFiuBqORVFPfIkswmfGXxHA=' with value 'text/markdown'; malformed or encoded-looking parameters.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with superficial obfuscation via variable names and some irregular parameters. No evidence of malicious code, network activity, or data leaks. The obfuscation and malformed parameters could be attempts to conceal or misconfigure but do not actively execute malicious actions. The lack of code injection, external communication, or handling of untrusted input indicates a low security risk. The obfuscation is high, but this alone does not imply malicious intent. The suspicious parameter warrants further review but is not definitive.",
  "conclusion": "The package setup script appears benign, with superficial obfuscation and no active malicious behavior. The irregular parameters and obfuscation merit caution but do not constitute malware or significant security threats.",
