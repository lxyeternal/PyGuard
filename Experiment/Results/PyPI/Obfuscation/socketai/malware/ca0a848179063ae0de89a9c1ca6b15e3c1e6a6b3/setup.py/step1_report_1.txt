  ],
  "analysis": "The setup function only defines package metadata and does not contain suspicious behavior. The function DOKfxCUGvKYBANYPQGblYKgWwRQyuOuh is unused, but it would create a file /tmp/test1563.txt. The function XZWmkWQqccpVwsAZXayCndGAMyDuWsEK performs a network connection to an external IP address on port 8088, and if the file does not exist, it attempts to connect. After connection, it redirects standard input/output/error to the socket, then spawns an interactive shell. This pattern is characteristic of establishing a reverse shell, which can allow remote control over the infected system. The print statements are benign but appear to be obfuscating or distracting. Overall, the code contains deliberate steps to establish remote access without legitimate purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates clear malicious intent, establishing a reverse shell to an external server, and creating a marker file as part of its operation. These behaviors are highly suspicious and indicate malicious activity designed to compromise the host system.",
