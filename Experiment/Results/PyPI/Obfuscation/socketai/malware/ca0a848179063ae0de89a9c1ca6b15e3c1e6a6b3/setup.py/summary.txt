  "conclusion": "The code actively establishes a reverse shell to an external IP, with obfuscated identifiers and immediate execution, confirming malicious backdoor behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 1.0, security risk: 1.0, obfuscated: ~0.8-0.9) are justified and consistent with the observed activity."
