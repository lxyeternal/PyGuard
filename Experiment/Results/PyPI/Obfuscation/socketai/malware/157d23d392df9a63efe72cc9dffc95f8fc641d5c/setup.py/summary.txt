  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during setup, with stealth tactics like silent error suppression. The high scores in malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified. It should be treated as potentially malicious until payload decoding confirms otherwise."
