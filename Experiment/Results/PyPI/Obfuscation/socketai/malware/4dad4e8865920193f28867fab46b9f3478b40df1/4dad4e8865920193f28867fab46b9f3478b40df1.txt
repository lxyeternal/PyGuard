      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious behavior, primarily due to executing an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during setup. The tactics used are characteristic of malware, and the behavior poses a significant security risk. Without decoding the payload, the exact malicious intent cannot be confirmed, but the indicators strongly suggest malicious activity. The package should be flagged and further analyzed before use."
