  "conclusion": "The provided reports are accurate and appropriately score the dependency's security posture based on the analyzed features. Suspicious behaviors are acknowledged but not overstated, and no concrete malicious payloads are identified. The scores and reasoning are well-aligned, indicating a moderate level of concern primarily due to dynamic code features. Further static or dynamic analysis is recommended if suspicious features are confirmed or more code details become available."
