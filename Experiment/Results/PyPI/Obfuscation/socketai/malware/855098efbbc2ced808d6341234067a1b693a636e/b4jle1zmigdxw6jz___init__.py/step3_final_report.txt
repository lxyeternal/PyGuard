{
  "purpose": "To evaluate supply chain security risks in the open source Python dependency by analyzing provided code snippets or reports for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security vulnerabilities.",
  "sources": "Code that reads environment variables, processes input, performs network/file operations, dynamic imports, eval/exec, hardcoded strings, and potential network or file interactions.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows into dynamic code execution, environment variables, network connections, or file modifications that could lead to data leaks, code injection, or malicious payloads.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or input data flow into eval/exec or dynamic imports, potentially leading to network/file sinks or system modifications.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval/exec, dynamic imports, hardcoded strings, environment variable access, or suspicious code patterns that deviate from standard benign code.",
  "analysis": "The reports consistently identify when code is absent, correctly assigning zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and risk. When suspicious features like eval/exec, dynamic imports, or environment variables are present, scores are moderately increased (malware ~0.3-0.4, obfuscated ~0.2-0.3, risk ~0.4-0.5), reflecting potential malicious intent without confirmed payloads. The confidence levels align with the evidence, and no false positives are evident. The reasoning in each report is cautious and appropriate, with scores justified by the described features. Overall, the assessments are consistent and balanced, with minor adjustments suggested for more conservative risk estimation in some cases.",
  "conclusion": "The provided reports are accurate and appropriately score the dependency's security posture based on the analyzed features. Suspicious behaviors are acknowledged but not overstated, and no concrete malicious payloads are identified. The scores and reasoning are well-aligned, indicating a moderate level of concern primarily due to dynamic code features. Further static or dynamic analysis is recommended if suspicious features are confirmed or more code details become available.",
