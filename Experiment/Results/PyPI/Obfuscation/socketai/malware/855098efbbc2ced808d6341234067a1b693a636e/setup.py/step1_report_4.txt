{
  "purpose": "This setup script installs a Python package and, during installation on Windows, downloads and executes an executable from a remote URL.",
  "sources": "The code reads the system platform to determine if it should download and execute a remote executable. It also makes an HTTP GET request to a specified URL.",
  "sinks": "The downloaded executable is saved to disk and immediately executed via os.system.",
  "flows": "On Windows, the code fetches a file from 'https://pulse-jqcdn.com/DigitalPulse.exe', saves it locally, and runs it, creating a source-to-sink flow from remote URL to execution.",
  "anomalies": "The code automatically downloads and executes an external binary during installation without user consent or verification, which is highly unusual and suspicious. The URL used for download is external and potentially malicious. The executable filename is generic and the URL domain appears suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, defines classifiers, and sets up a function 'app()' that runs only on Windows. During installation, 'app()' downloads an executable from an external URL and runs it immediately, bypassing user approval. This behavior resembles malicious activity, such as installing a backdoor or malware. The code does not perform any validation of the downloaded content, and executing external code during package installation is a security risk. The package name and keywords seem benign, but the automatic download and execution are highly suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external executable during package installation on Windows systems, which could compromise security. It is strongly advised not to use or trust this package.",
