  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Code Review Summary:**\n\n- The code defines a setup script for a Python package.\n- On Windows (`platform == 'win32'`), during installation, it downloads an executable from `'https://pulse-jqcdn.com/DigitalPulse.exe'` using `requests`.\n- It saves the file as `'DigitalPulse.exe'`.\n- Immediately after download, it executes the file with `os.system('start ' + filename)`.\n\n**Key observations:**\n\n- The download URL is hardcoded and suspicious.\n- The executable is run automatically without user consent or validation.\n- This behavior is atypical for a standard setup script.\n- The code performs remote code execution during package installation, which is a security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code **does** download and execute an external executable during installation **on Windows**.\n- The URL used is suspicious and could be malicious.\n- The behavior is not standard and indicates potential malicious intent.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- No validation or checksum verification of the downloaded file.\n- No user prompt or consent.\n- Executing arbitrary code during package installation is a security risk.\n- Using `os.system('start ...')` to run the executable is risky.\n\n---\n\n### Score evaluations:\n\n#### Malware score:\n- All reports assign **0.9** or **1**.\n- The code **does** download and execute an external executable automatically, which is malicious behavior.\n- The URL is suspicious, and the execution is without user knowledge.\n- **Conclusion:** The malware score should be **1** for all reports, as the code performs malicious activity.\n\n#### Obfuscated score:\n- All reports assign **0**.\n- The code is straightforward, not obfuscated.\n- **Conclusion:** Obfuscated score remains **0**.\n\n#### Security risk score:\n- All reports assign **0.9** or **1**.\n- The behavior is highly dangerous, enabling remote code execution, malware installation, or backdoors.\n- **Conclusion:** Security risk should be **1** for all reports.\n\n---\n\n### Justifications for any high scores:\n- The code **automatically downloads and executes** a remote executable during package installation.\n- No validation, user prompt, or consent.\n- The URL is suspicious and indicates malicious intent.\n- Such behavior is a classic indicator of supply chain malware.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency check:\n- The scores are consistent with the described behavior.\n- The malware and security risk scores are appropriately high.\n- Obfuscated score remains at 0, which is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Additional comments:\n- The reports correctly identify the malicious nature of the code.\n- The only discrepancy is the confidence level; most are 0.9 or 1, which is appropriate given the clear malicious behavior.\n- The reasoning is sound across all reports.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code **does** contain malicious behavior.\n- The **malware score** should be **1**.\n- The **security risk** should be **1**.\n- The **obfuscated** score remains **0**.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 1\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 1\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Value | Justification                                              |\n|----------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | 1            | Executes downloaded external executable during install.     |\n| Obfuscated     | 0            | Code is straightforward, no obfuscation present.            |\n| Security Risk  | 1            | High risk due to remote code execution during package install. |\n\n**Conclusion:** The package is highly malicious, and the code should be considered unsafe and potentially harmful.",
