{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that, on Windows, downloads and executes an external executable file during installation.",
  "sources": "The URL 'https://pulse-jqcdn.com/DigitalPulse.exe' accessed via requests.get, and the local filename 'DigitalPulse.exe' written to disk.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the downloaded file using os.system('start ' + filename).",
  "flows": "requests.get retrieves content from the URL -> file is saved locally as 'DigitalPulse.exe' -> os.system executes the downloaded file.",
  "anomalies": "Automatically downloading and executing an external executable during package installation without user consent; the URL used is suspicious and may be malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a setup configuration with a custom install command that, on Windows, downloads an executable from an external URL and runs it. The code uses the 'requests' library to fetch a file from a suspicious domain, then executes it with 'os.system'. This behavior is atypical for a standard setup script and indicates potential malicious intent, such as remote code execution or malware distribution. The URL appears suspicious, and executing downloaded files without user approval is a significant security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by automatically downloading and executing an external executable during installation, representing a high security threat. The package is highly suspicious and should not be trusted.",
