      "conclusion": "The code exhibits highly malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external executable during package installation on Windows. This constitutes a severe supply chain security threat. The behavior is explicit, and the associated scores should be set to the maximum to reflect the high risk and malicious intent."

      "conclusion": "The provided reports are accurate and appropriately score the dependency's security posture based on the analyzed features. Suspicious behaviors are acknowledged but not overstated, and no concrete malicious payloads are identified. The scores and reasoning are well-aligned, indicating a moderate level of concern primarily due to dynamic code features. Further static or dynamic analysis is recommended if suspicious features are confirmed or more code details become available."
