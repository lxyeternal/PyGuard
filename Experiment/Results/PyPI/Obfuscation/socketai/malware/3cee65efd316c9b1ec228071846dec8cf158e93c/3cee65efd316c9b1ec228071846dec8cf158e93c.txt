      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during package setup, with stealth tactics and error suppression. The scores assigned are appropriate; the behavior warrants treating the package as potentially malicious until payload content is verified."
