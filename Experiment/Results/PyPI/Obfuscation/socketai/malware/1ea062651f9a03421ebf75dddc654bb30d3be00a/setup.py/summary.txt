  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious activity through the silent execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command during package setup. The behavior indicates high malicious potential, justified by high obfuscation and concealment techniques. The scores are appropriate and reflect a high security threat, warranting caution and further investigation."
