{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a Python module defining a network proxy or SOCKS-related library, primarily consisting of imports and an API declaration.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules, notably an obfuscated module 'pInLqJDlBnRfaoHshlkoIEZAsbQysXhI' and various error and helper modules.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform network operations within this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident in this static code; it mainly sets up imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated import name 'pInLqJDlBnRfaoHshlkoIEZAsbQysXhI' which could be suspicious, but no malicious activity is demonstrated.",
  "analysis": "The code is structurally standard for a Python module, with no executable logic or functions. The obfuscated import name warrants suspicion but is not evidence of malicious intent on its own. The reports provided are 'Empty response' with no detailed data, indicating a lack of substantive evidence. Without further context or raw responses, no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors can be confirmed. The code does not exhibit obfuscation techniques or malicious patterns such as dynamic execution or network exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with only a minor concern about the obfuscated import name. The reports lack detailed evidence, so the security risk and malware likelihood are minimal. Scores should be low, reflecting the absence of confirmed issues.",
