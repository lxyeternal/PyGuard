  "review": "Let's analyze this systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code snippet appears to be a typical Python module with imports, constants, and an `__all__` declaration.\n   - The actual code does not contain any executable logic or functions that could be malicious or vulnerable.\n   - The only potential concern is the import of a module named `pInLqJDlBnRfaoHshlkoIEZAsbQysXhI` from `.connector`. The name is obfuscated, which could be suspicious, but on its own, it's not evidence of malicious activity.\n   - The rest of the code is standard, with no signs of embedded malware, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports all state \"Empty response\" with no additional information.\n   - This indicates that the reports lack substantive details about the incident, such as actual malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or code flaws.\n   - Relying solely on \"Empty response\" reports makes it impossible to verify any claims or assess risks accurately.\n   - The reports seem to be placeholders or incomplete, not providing meaningful insights.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - Since the reports contain no evidence or detailed description, assigning high scores for malware, obfuscation, or risk would be unjustified.\n   - Any high scores would be based purely on suspicion, which is not acceptable in a responsible security assessment.\n   - Therefore, I would recommend low scores across the board, reflecting the lack of evidence.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores (>0.5):**\n   - No evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities has been presented.\n   - The only potentially suspicious element is the obfuscated import name, but that alone is insufficient to justify a high risk score.\n   - The \"Empty response\" reports do not substantiate any threat.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - No signs of malware are evident in the code snippet.\n   - The reports do not provide any details indicating malicious behavior.\n   - Therefore, the malware score should be minimal, close to zero.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - Any claims that the code is malicious or vulnerable based solely on the obfuscated import name are speculative.\n   - Without concrete evidence, such assumptions are unjustified.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - Given the lack of evidence, the scores should reflect a very low risk, malware, and obfuscation levels.\n   - The current reports do not provide enough information to justify higher scores.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0.0** — No evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0.2** — Slight suspicion due to obfuscated import name, but not enough for a higher score.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** — Very low, given the lack of information.\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are essentially empty and do not substantiate any claims of security issues. The code appears benign, with only a minor concern about obfuscated naming, which is insufficient to assign a higher risk level. I recommend maintaining low scores and requesting more detailed reports before making any definitive conclusions.",
