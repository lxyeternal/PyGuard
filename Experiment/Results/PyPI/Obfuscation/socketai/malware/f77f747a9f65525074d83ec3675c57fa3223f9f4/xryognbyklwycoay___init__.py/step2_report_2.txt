  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:\n   - The code is a module that imports various components from local submodules: `connector`, `errors`, `helpers`, and `proto`.\n   - It defines a version string `\"0.1.2\"` and an `__all__` list specifying public API components.\n   - The code appears to be part of a network proxy or SOCKS-related library, given the names like `ProxyConnector`, `SocksError`, `open_connection`, etc.\n\n2. **Reported Issues**:\n   - All reports indicate `\"Empty response\"` with no raw response data, labeled as report numbers 1 through 5.\n   - This suggests that the reports lack detailed information, such as specific vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or code flaws.\n\n3. **Confirmation of Issues in the Code**:\n   - The code snippet itself does not reveal any malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n   - The imports are from local modules; without their content, we cannot determine if they contain issues.\n   - The code is minimal and primarily structural, not operational.\n\n4. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic**:\n   - The reports do not provide any actual findings or evidence; they only state \"Empty response.\"\n   - Without detailed raw responses or explanations, these reports are uninformative and cannot be validated.\n   - The reports seem to be placeholders or incomplete, lacking concrete data.\n\n5. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - Since no specific vulnerabilities, malware, or obfuscation are indicated, scores should reflect the absence of evidence.\n   - **Malware score**: Should be 0, as there's no indication of malicious code.\n   - **Obfuscated score**: Likely 0, unless the imported modules are obfuscated, but we have no evidence.\n   - **Risk score**: Should be low (e.g., 0.0 or 0.1), as no vulnerabilities or malicious activities are demonstrated.\n\n6. **Potential Risks and Assumptions**:\n   - The reports are too vague; claiming \"Empty response\" does not imply any security issue.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities can be reasonably made based solely on this.\n\n7. **Overall Evaluation**:\n   - The code appears structurally sound and typical for a module defining network proxy components.\n   - The reports do not provide any concrete evidence of issues.\n   - Without further details, there is no basis to assign higher risk or malware scores.\n\n**Final Recommendations**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0.1 (or 0.0), reflecting no demonstrated issues but acknowledging that the reports are incomplete.\n\n**Summary**:\nBased on the available information, there is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risk. The reports are insufficient to warrant concern. Future reports should include detailed raw responses, code snippets, or specific vulnerabilities for proper assessment.",
