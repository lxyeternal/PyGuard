  "purpose": "Implementation of SOCKS proxy client supporting SOCKS4 and SOCKS5, including connection, authentication, and address resolution.",
  "sources": "Hostname, ports, credentials, environment variables, socket data, DNS resolution.",
  "sinks": "Socket send/recv operations, network data transmission, address resolution functions.",
  "flows": "Input data (hostnames, credentials) flows into socket operations and address resolution; responses and errors flow back into control flow, potentially raising exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with non-descriptive variable names, complex control flow, custom error classes with obscure names, some incomplete functions, but no hardcoded secrets or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a SOCKS proxy client supporting SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols, with asynchronous socket operations, address resolution, and optional authentication. Obfuscation and complex control flow are present but appear to serve concealment rather than malicious intent. No evidence of malicious payloads such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or sabotage is detected. Error handling is comprehensive, and the logic aligns with standard proxy client behavior. The heavy obfuscation warrants caution but does not confirm malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate SOCKS proxy client implementation with significant obfuscation. There is no concrete evidence of malware or malicious intent. The obfuscation increases suspicion but does not indicate active malicious behavior. Overall, it appears to be a complex but benign network utility module.",
