  "conclusion": "The code exhibits obfuscation and flexible proxy configuration that could be exploited maliciously, but no concrete malicious activity is evident. The suspicion levels are moderate, with malware scores around 0.2-0.3, obfuscated scores around 0.65, and security risk scores around 0.45. Continuous monitoring and input validation are recommended if integrated into production environments."
