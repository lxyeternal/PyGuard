{
  "purpose": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes, some inheriting from built-in exception types, likely for use in a larger application.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and inheritance declarations; no input reading or data sources identified.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points; no untrusted data handling or output present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink pathways; purely class definitions with inheritance.",
  "anomalies": "Class names are obfuscated with nonsensical, random strings, which may indicate code obfuscation. No meaningful logic, data handling, or typical malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code only defines multiple exception classes with obfuscated names, inheriting from standard exception types or OSError. There are no data input, data output, network connections, or other behaviors. The obfuscated class names could be a tactic to hide purpose, but without functional code, no malicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be obfuscated class definitions for exceptions with no operational or malicious intent. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are identifiable within this fragment.",
