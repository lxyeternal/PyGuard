{
  "purpose": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes with obfuscated, nonsensical class names, inheriting from standard exception classes or OSError, with no operational logic or data handling.",
  "sources": "Class definitions that inherit from exception classes; no input or data reading present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks or external interactions observed.",
  "flows": "No data or control flow; only class inheritance without methods or data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class names that appear intentionally nonsensical; absence of any operational code or logic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of multiple obfuscated exception class definitions with no methods, data handling, or external interactions. The obfuscation may be used to conceal intent but, in this context, does not indicate malicious activity. The malware score is appropriately zero, security risk is very low, and obfuscation is high due to class name obscurity. The code is benign and purely structural, with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of obfuscated exception class definitions with no malicious behavior or operational logic. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware and security risk scores should remain very low. The code poses no security threat based on this analysis.",
