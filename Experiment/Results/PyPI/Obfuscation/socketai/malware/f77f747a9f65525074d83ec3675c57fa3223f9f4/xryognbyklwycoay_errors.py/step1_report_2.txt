{
  "purpose": "The code defines several custom exception classes, likely intended for use in a larger application or package.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources; purely class declarations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flows or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink flows; code only defines classes without logic or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Class names are obfuscated, consisting of random strings. All classes inherit from base exception classes without additional logic or attributes, which might be used to hide malicious intent or behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for exceptions with obfuscated names. No data input, network activity, file operations, or suspicious logic is present. The naming scheme could be intended to hide the purpose of these exceptions or to evade detection. The absence of any functional code reduces the likelihood of malicious behavior, but obfuscated naming raises suspicion about intent to hide malicious use in a larger context.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be simple exception class definitions with obfuscated class names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks within this snippet alone. However, obfuscation may suggest an attempt to hide malicious or undesired functionality in a broader context.",
