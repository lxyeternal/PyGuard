{
  "purpose": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes, likely for use in a larger application, with no immediate operational logic.",
  "sources": "Class definitions at the beginning of the file, with no input reading or data handling observed.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output operations; no untrusted data handling or external communication present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; classes are purely structural with no methods or logic.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual class names that appear to be obfuscated or randomly generated; no functional code or logic, only class definitions. No configuration, environment variables, or external dependencies used.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of several custom exception class definitions with obfuscated, randomly-named class names inheriting from standard exception classes. There is no operational code, data handling, or network interaction. The absence of logic, input/output, or data processing indicates a lack of malicious behavior. The obfuscated class names could be an attempt to hide intent, but without functional code, no malicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains only obfuscated class definitions with no executable logic or data handling, indicating no malicious behavior or security risks. The unusual class names may be a form of obfuscation or placeholder code, but they do not pose security threats by themselves.",
