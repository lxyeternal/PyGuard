      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation and proxy support capabilities that could be exploited for malicious purposes, such as covert communication or data exfiltration. However, there is no direct evidence of malicious payloads in the provided snippet. The suspicion is primarily due to obfuscation and complex proxy handling, warranting cautious review before deployment or further static/dynamic analysis."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits obfuscation and flexible proxy configuration that could be exploited maliciously, but no concrete malicious activity is evident. The suspicion levels are moderate, with malware scores around 0.2-0.3, obfuscated scores around 0.65, and security risk scores around 0.45. Continuous monitoring and input validation are recommended if integrated into production environments."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate SOCKS proxy client implementation with significant obfuscation. There is no concrete evidence of malware or malicious intent. The obfuscation increases suspicion but does not indicate active malicious behavior. Overall, it appears to be a complex but benign network utility module."

      "conclusion": "The code is a set of obfuscated exception class definitions with no malicious behavior or operational logic. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware and security risk scores should remain very low. The code poses no security threat based on this analysis."
