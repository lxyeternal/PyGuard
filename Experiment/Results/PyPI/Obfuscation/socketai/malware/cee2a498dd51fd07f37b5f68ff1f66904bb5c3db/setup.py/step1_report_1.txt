{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package with additional functions that execute during installation, including network requests and file operations.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file, executing network requests via requests.get, reading system information via os.uname(), and reading/writing a local file ('pocbykotko.txt').",
  "sinks": "Network requests to external URLs ('https://api.ipify.org' and 'https://kotko.org'), writing to a local file ('pocbykotko.txt'), and encoding data into base64 for transmission.",
  "flows": "During installation, the code reads system info and public IP, encodes and transmits this info to external domains, and writes a proof string to a local file.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual activity includes network requests during setup, writing a proof string to a local file, and sending encoded system info to an external domain, which could be used for tracking or exfiltration. The variable and class names are obfuscated, but this alone is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script registers a cleanup function that executes during installation, which writes a string to a file named 'pocbykotko.txt'. It then gathers the system's external IP, hostname, and script path, encodes this info, and sends it via an HTTP GET request to 'https://kotko.org' with the data embedded in the URL. This behavior could be used for tracking, fingerprinting, or exfiltration of system info without user consent. The obfuscation of variable names and the unsolicited network activity during installation are suspicious. No malicious payloads like reverse shells or destructive commands are present, but the data collection and transmission are concerning for privacy and security.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior related to data collection and transmission during package setup, with obfuscated naming. While it does not contain clear malware such as system damage or reverse shells, the unsolicited external communication and data exfiltration indicate potential malicious intent. The code should be treated with caution and further analyzed in context.",
