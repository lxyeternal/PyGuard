{
  "purpose": "The code performs system info collection (public IP, hostname, script path), encodes this data, and exfiltrates it to an external URL during package setup. It also writes a proof string to a local file during cleanup.",
  "sources": "Network requests to 'https://api.ipify.org' and 'https://kotko.org'; reading 'README.md'; writing to 'pocbykotko.txt'; gathering system info via os.uname() and __file__.",
  "sinks": "External HTTP GET requests transmitting encoded system info; writing to local file; data sent to external domains; encoded data included in URL parameters.",
  "flows": "System info is collected, encoded in base64, and sent via GET request during the registered cleanup function executed at exit during setup.",
  "anomalies": "Network requests and data exfiltration during package installation; obfuscated variable and class names; writing to a file during cleanup; data encoding and transmission without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code registers a function to run at exit that collects system info (public IP, hostname, script path), encodes it, and sends it to an external URL. It also writes a proof string to a local file. These actions occur during package setup, which is unusual and suspicious. The obfuscation of variable names suggests an attempt to hide malicious intent. The external data transmission during installation poses privacy and security risks, indicating potential covert tracking or exfiltration. No destructive payloads are present, but the behavior aligns with malicious data collection mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits covert data exfiltration during package installation, with obfuscation and external communication that raise serious security and privacy concerns. While it does not contain overt destructive malware, its behavior is highly suspicious and potentially malicious. It should be treated as malicious or highly suspicious.",
