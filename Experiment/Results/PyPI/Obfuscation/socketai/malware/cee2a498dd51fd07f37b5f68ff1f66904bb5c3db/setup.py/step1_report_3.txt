{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a setup configuration for a Python package with some additional custom installation steps.",
  "sources": "Requests to 'https://api.ipify.org' and 'https://kotko.org?', file read/write operations, and environment variables like 'path'.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URLs with data, file operations, and possibly base64-encoded data being sent via requests.",
  "flows": "During installation, the code fetches the external IP address, encodes some system info, and makes a GET request to 'kotko.org' with encoded data.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual code constructs such as registering a function to run at exit that performs network requests and writes to a file, encoding system data, and sending it to an external URL. The code includes obfuscated variable names and seems designed to exfiltrate environment info during installation.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom install class that registers a function to run on program exit. This function writes a line to a file 'pocbykotko.txt', then collects external IP, hostname, and current directory info. It encodes this data in base64 and sends it via a GET request to 'kotko.org'. The setup configuration also includes non-standard fields and obfuscated variable names. These behaviors suggest data exfiltration and potential backdoor activity during package installation, which is highly suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior aimed at exfiltrating system and network information during package installation. It is designed to run at exit, collect system data, encode it, and send it to a remote server. This is indicative of a malicious backdoor or tracking mechanism embedded in the package.",
