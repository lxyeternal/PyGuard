{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package with custom installation behavior, including writing to a file and making network requests during the installation process.",
  "sources": "Input sources include requests.get('https://api.ipify.org'), requests.get('https://kotko.org?...'), and reading the file system (e.g., __file__, README.md). It also reads environment info via os.uname() and file path data.",
  "sinks": "Data sinks involve writing to 'pocbykotko.txt', sending data via HTTP GET requests, and writing to files. The requests sent include IP address, hostname, and encoded path data, which may be transmitted to external domains.",
  "flows": "The flow includes obtaining the public IP and system hostname, encoding these with the script's path, and then sending this information via HTTP GET to external URLs during the package's installation process.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs network requests and writes to a file during package install, which is unusual for typical setup scripts. The data transmitted includes system IP, hostname, and script path, and is sent to external servers without clear user consent. The use of base64 encoding and request utils.quote suggests obfuscation of data transmission. The code writes to a file named 'pocbykotko.txt' during exit, indicating potential for hidden or backdoor behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script modifies installation behavior by registering a function that executes upon exit, which fetches the public IP and system hostname, encodes this information, and sends it to external URLs. The network activity and data exfiltration during package installation is suspicious. No obvious malicious payloads such as system damage or reverse shells are present, but the information leakage and external communication could be exploited maliciously or for tracking purposes. The code's structure, including obfuscation-like variable names and encoding, suggests an attempt to hide its true intent. The code does not contain typical malware such as damage or backdoors, but it could be used for covert data collection.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior by collecting and transmitting system information during package installation without explicit user consent, indicating potential for malicious activity or privacy invasion. While it does not contain direct malware payloads, its data exfiltration practices are concerning.",
