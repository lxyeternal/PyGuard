{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package with additional side effects, including network requests and file operations, during installation.",
  "sources": "Requests to external URLs ('https://api.ipify.org' and 'https://kotko.org'), reading the README.md file, and writing to 'pocbykotko.txt'.",
  "sinks": "Network requests potentially leaking system information; writing to a local file; constructing and sending a URL with encoded data.",
  "flows": "On installation, the code writes to a local file, retrieves the public IP address, gathers system hostname, encodes this data, and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious domain.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes network communication during package installation, writing to a file named 'pocbykotko.txt' with suspicious content, encoding and sending system data to an external domain ('kotko.org'), and obfuscated variable names. The code does not perform typical setup tasks and seems to collect and exfiltrate system information.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom install command class that registers a function to run at exit. This function performs multiple potentially malicious actions: it creates or appends to a file named 'pocbykotko.txt' with a proof message, retrieves the external IP address, hostname, encodes this info, and sends it via a GET request to a suspicious URL ('kotko.org') with a base64-encoded payload. These behaviors are highly unusual for a package setup script and suggest data exfiltration or malicious monitoring. The rest of the setup code appears standard, but the side effects during installation are concerning.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior primarily through network requests and data exfiltration during package installation. It collects system info and sends it to an external domain without user consent, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. The obfuscated variable names and unusual network activity during setup further support malicious intent.",
