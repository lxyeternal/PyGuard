{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package with additional functions to perform network requests and file operations, potentially for benign package installation.",
  "sources": "Network requests to 'https://api.ipify.org' and 'https://kotko.org', file operations writing to 'pocbykotko.txt', reading environment info such as system hostname and IP address.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URLs, writing data to a local file, and encoding data with base64 before sending via GET request to 'kotko.org'.",
  "flows": "During installation, the code executes a function that gathers system info, makes network requests, encodes data, and sends it to external domains. Data flows from system info collection (source) through network requests and encoding, then to external servers (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Unusual code for a setup script: network requests to unknown domains, writing proof of concept text to a file during install, encoding and sending system information externally, and dynamically constructing request URLs. The variable and class names are obfuscated, which can be a tactic to hide malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script is primarily a setup configuration for a Python package but includes a function registered to run at exit that collects system info (IP, hostname, path), encodes this data, and transmits it to an external domain ('kotko.org'). This behavior is suspicious for a package installation script, which normally should not perform network operations or send data externally. The code uses obfuscated variable names and includes functions that seem unnecessary for typical package setup, indicating potential malicious activity such as data exfiltration or tracking. There is no evidence of backdoors or direct harm to files beyond the proof-of-concept text file. However, the data transmission to an external domain during installation constitutes a security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains suspicious behavior involving data collection and exfiltration during package installation, which is unusual and potentially malicious. The obfuscated style and network activity suggest an attempt to secretly gather and send system information. This code should be reviewed further, and caution is advised in using this package.",
