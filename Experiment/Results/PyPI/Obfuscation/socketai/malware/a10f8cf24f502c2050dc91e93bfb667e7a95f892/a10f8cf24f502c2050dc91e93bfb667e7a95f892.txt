      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal setup script with a suspicious-looking package name. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or active obfuscation beyond the name. The overall security risk is very low. The obfuscation score should be modest (~0.2), and malware score remains zero. The package name's randomness warrants cautious review but does not constitute malicious activity."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits covert data exfiltration behavior with layered obfuscation and multiple network channels, indicating malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are justified; the malware likelihood is high, and the security risk is significant. The obfuscation level is substantial but consistent with malicious intent. The overall assessment confirms the code as highly suspicious and potentially malicious."
