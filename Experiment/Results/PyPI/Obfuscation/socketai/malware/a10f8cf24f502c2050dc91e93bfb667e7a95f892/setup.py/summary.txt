  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal setup script with a suspicious-looking package name. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or active obfuscation beyond the name. The overall security risk is very low. The obfuscation score should be modest (~0.2), and malware score remains zero. The package name's randomness warrants cautious review but does not constitute malicious activity."
