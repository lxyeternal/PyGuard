{
  "purpose": "This code is used to define the setup configuration for a Python package distribution, specifying its name and version.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package configuration data from the setup() call, which contains the package name and version.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks where untrusted data could lead to a security vulnerability; the code does not process external input or execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code simply calls setup() with static arguments.",
  "anomalies": "The package name 'e1cnshd5zu961mkf' appears to be a random or obfuscated string, which could be suspicious but is not inherently malicious. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no hidden or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup and find_packages from setuptools, then calls setup() with a hardcoded package name and version. There is no indication of malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscated code. The package name may suggest an attempt to obscure the package's purpose, but it does not execute or include malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard minimal setup script for a Python package with an obfuscated or random package name. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this code fragment.",

  "obfuscated": 0.2,
