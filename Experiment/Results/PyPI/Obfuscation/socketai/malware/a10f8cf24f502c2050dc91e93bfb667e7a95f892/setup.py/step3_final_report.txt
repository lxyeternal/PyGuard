  "purpose": "Minimal Python setup script configuring package name and version.",
  "sources": "Static import of setuptools, static package name and version in setup() call.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, network activity, or untrusted input.",
  "flows": "None; static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Package name appears as a random string, which could be obfuscation or placeholder but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with no dynamic behavior, network activity, or code obfuscation techniques. The only unusual aspect is the package name, which is a random string, potentially used for obfuscation or evasion. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with malware scores at zero. Obfuscation scores vary slightly, with some overestimating based solely on the package name; a more accurate assessment would assign a low obfuscation score (~0.2). Security risk remains minimal, reflecting the lack of vulnerabilities or malicious intent. The code's simplicity and static nature strongly suggest it is not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal setup script with a suspicious-looking package name. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or active obfuscation beyond the name. The overall security risk is very low. The obfuscation score should be modest (~0.2), and malware score remains zero. The package name's randomness warrants cautious review but does not constitute malicious activity.",
