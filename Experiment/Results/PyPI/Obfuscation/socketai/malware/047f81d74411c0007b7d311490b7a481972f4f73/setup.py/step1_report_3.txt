{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, with an additional function that performs a network request during installation.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', network request to an external URL during installation",
  "sinks": "External HTTP request made within a function called during installation, possibly exfiltrating data or triggering malicious actions",
  "flows": "The environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' is read and concatenated into a URL, which is then requested via HTTP during package installation",
  "anomalies": "Unusual naming conventions, obfuscated function and variable names, network request triggered during installation, no clear legitimate purpose for the network call",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools, requests, and os modules. It defines a function that attempts to read the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable and send a GET request to a suspicious URL containing this data. The function is called during the installation process via a custom install command class. The setup configuration includes minimal package metadata. The network request during installation is suspicious, as it could be used to exfiltrate data or activate malicious servers. The obfuscated naming further suggests malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes a malicious pattern where installation triggers a network request that leaks system information ('COMPUTERNAME') to an external server. This behavior indicates a high likelihood of malicious intent, potentially for data exfiltration or remote command control. The obfuscated code and network activity during installation are strong indicators of malicious behavior.",
