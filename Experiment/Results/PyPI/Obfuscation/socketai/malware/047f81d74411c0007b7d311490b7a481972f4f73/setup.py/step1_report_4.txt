{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, with an embedded function that attempts to send a GET request to a specific URL, potentially for tracking or malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' and makes an HTTP GET request to 'https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php?live=Installation from ' + computer name.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get call sends data to an external domain, which could leak system information if executed.",
  "flows": "The environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' is read, then used to construct a URL, and an HTTP request is made to that URL, potentially transmitting the computer name.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated function names and variable names; the function OYLUdRBUypdEtyQBEXgxjcLnDDuPWAmK() is designed to send data externally, which is unusual for a setup script. The code in the custom install class calls this function during installation, which is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools and a requests library. It defines a function with a complex name that attempts to read an environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME'. It then constructs a URL with this variable and makes an HTTP GET request to it. The class 'aynTTzVWDgpujgpRlFdrYNGlgbbsMbou' subclasses 'install' and overrides the 'tqkvnQxhuFzBgmHKcdiBszKeqQxYYeHE' method to invoke the function during installation. The code's purpose seems to be to secretly send the system's 'COMPUTERNAME' to an external server during package installation. The obfuscated names and the network call in the installation process are red flags indicating malicious or at least suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains suspicious behavior where system information is transmitted to an external domain during package installation, which could be used for tracking or malicious purposes. The obfuscated function and network activity during install suggest malicious intent.",
