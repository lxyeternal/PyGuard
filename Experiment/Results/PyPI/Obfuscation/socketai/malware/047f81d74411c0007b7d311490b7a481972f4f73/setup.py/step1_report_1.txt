{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up a Python package using setuptools, but it also contains code that performs a network request to a remote server, potentially as part of malicious activity.",
  "sources": "The environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' and the URL 'https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php?live=Installation from ...' used in requests.get()",
  "sinks": "The request to the external URL, which could be used for data exfiltration or malicious command/control communication",
  "flows": "The environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' is read, then combined with a URL, and a GET request is sent to that URL during installation",
  "anomalies": "The code makes a network request during the installation process, which is unusual for a standard setup script. The URL is suspicious and resembles a command-and-control or data exfiltration server. The code also uses an obfuscated function name and class name, and the setup parameters contain nonsensical strings.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries for setup but also imports 'requests', which is used to send a GET request to an external URL during the package installation. The function OYLUdRBUypdEtyQBEXgxjcLnDDuPWAmK reads the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable, then constructs a URL and performs a GET request. The class 'aynTTzVWDgpujgpRlFdrYNGlgbbsMbou' overrides the install command to execute this function during installation. The use of environment variables and network communication during setup is suspicious, indicating potential malicious intent such as data collection or command and control. The URL domain 'linkedopports.com' is obscure and could be malicious or suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by performing an external network request during installation, likely for data exfiltration or malicious control. The obfuscated naming and unusual setup parameters further suggest malicious intent. This package should be considered unsafe.",
