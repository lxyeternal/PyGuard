{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to be a setup script for a Python package, configuring installation parameters and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables ('COMPUTERNAME') and makes an HTTP GET request to an external URL ('https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php?...').",
  "sinks": "The request to the external URL could potentially be used to exfiltrate information or trigger malicious activity if the URL is malicious or manipulated.",
  "flows": "The environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' is used as part of the URL in the requests.get call, linking system info to the external request, which is then triggered during installation via the custom 'install' command.",
  "anomalies": "The code retrieves system-specific data ('COMPUTERNAME') and sends it to an external domain without user consent or disclosure. The URL domain is suspicious and not a standard package repository. The class and function names are obfuscated, which could indicate malicious intent. The setup parameters contain nonsensical or obfuscated fields.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools but also includes a function that collects the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable, which is Windows-specific. It then makes an HTTP GET request to a suspicious domain, passing system info in the URL. This network activity occurs during the installation process, specifically within a custom install command class. The obfuscated naming and the external call with system data suggest potential privacy invasion or malicious activity. The package's setup configuration has nonsensical key names, further indicating obfuscation or malicious intent. No other suspicious code, such as code execution, data exfiltration beyond this request, or backdoors, is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting system information and sending it to an external server during package installation, with obfuscated code elements that obscure intent. The external request could be used for tracking or data exfiltration, indicating a security risk. The overall risk score is high due to these activities.",
