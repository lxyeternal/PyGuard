{
  "purpose": "The code performs a network request during package installation, transmitting the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable to an external URL, which is suspicious and potentially malicious.",
  "sources": "The environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' read via os.environ, and the URL 'https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php?live=Installation from ' concatenated with this variable.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get call sends data over the network to an external server, potentially leading to data exfiltration or remote command and control.",
  "flows": "The source 'COMPUTERNAME' is read in the function OYLUdRBUypdEtyQBEXgxjcLnDDuPWAmK, which then constructs a URL and sends it via requests.get during the overridden install command execution.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function and class names, the use of environment variables in URLs, and network activity during package setup are unusual and suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a function that reads 'COMPUTERNAME' and makes a GET request to a suspicious URL, and hooks this function into a custom install class. The setup configuration contains obfuscated names and minimal metadata. All signals indicate malicious intent, including data exfiltration during installation, obfuscation, and contact with a suspicious domain. The network request transmits system-specific info without user consent, fitting typical malicious supply chain patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during installation, with obfuscation and external contact indicating high malicious intent. The activity aligns with known supply chain attacks and warrants high security concern.",
