{
  "purpose": "Defines a function with an obfuscated name that prints 'installed' and calls it immediately.",
  "sources": "No external inputs or data sources; static code with no data reads.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data leaks, network activity, or external data handling.",
  "flows": "Function call flow; no data flow from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated, nonsensical function name; no malicious code or behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is trivial, defining and invoking a function that prints a static message. No external inputs, data leaks, network activity, or sensitive operations are present. The obfuscated function name raises suspicion but does not indicate malicious intent. The code's behavior is benign, with no malicious or security-threatening elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with obfuscation primarily in the function name. No malicious activity or security risks are evident. The malware score is 0, and the overall security risk is minimal. Obfuscation is moderate but not indicative of malicious intent.",
