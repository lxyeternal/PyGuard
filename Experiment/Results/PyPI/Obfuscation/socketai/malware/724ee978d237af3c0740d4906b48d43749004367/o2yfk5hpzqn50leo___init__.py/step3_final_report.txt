  "purpose": "Detects and executes a base64-encoded payload, likely malicious obfuscated code.",
  "sources": "Reads the base64 string from a hardcoded variable and decodes it using base64 library.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing decoded code, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.",
  "flows": "Base64 string source -> base64 decoding -> exec() sink.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation via large base64 payload, immediate execution without validation, complex encoded string.",
  "analysis": "The code imports base64 as 'b', decodes a lengthy, complex base64 string, and executes it directly. This pattern indicates obfuscation and potential malicious intent, as it conceals the payload's true behavior. The pattern of decoding and executing an opaque payload is a classic malicious indicator, especially in open-source dependencies where such obfuscation is unusual for legitimate code. The high complexity and immediate execution without validation strongly suggest malicious activity, such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or remote code execution. The high obfuscation score (1), malware suspicion (1), and security risk (1) are justified given this pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits a classic malicious obfuscation pattern—decoding a large, complex base64 payload and executing it immediately. The high suspicion scores are appropriate, indicating a high probability of malicious intent. This pattern warrants further payload analysis and should be treated as malicious.",
