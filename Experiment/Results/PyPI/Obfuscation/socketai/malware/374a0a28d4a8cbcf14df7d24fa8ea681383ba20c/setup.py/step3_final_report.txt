{
  "purpose": "The code dynamically overwrites the source file of the core Python module 'socket' with data from 'WebQuickAuth/tmp.py' and then imports 'WebQuickAuth.tmp', potentially executing malicious code.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from '__init__.py'; inspecting source file of 'socket'; reading 'WebQuickAuth/tmp.py'; environment variables 'py_build' and 'py_dbg'.",
  "sinks": "Writing binary data into the source file of 'socket'; importing 'WebQuickAuth.tmp' which executes its code.",
  "flows": "Version info read -> environment variable checks -> if 'py_dbg' set, print socket source -> if 'py_build' not set, open socket source file in append mode -> write 'WebQuickAuth/tmp.py' content -> import 'WebQuickAuth.tmp' to execute code.",
  "anomalies": "Overwriting the source code of a core Python module ('socket') during setup; dynamic source file inspection; obfuscated package name; use of environment variables to control behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code extracts version info, then, based on environment variables, may print the source file of 'socket'. If 'py_build' is not set, it appends the contents of 'WebQuickAuth/tmp.py' to the source file of 'socket', a core module, which is highly suspicious. It then imports 'WebQuickAuth.tmp', executing its code. The package name and variable names are obfuscated, indicating an attempt to hide malicious intent. Overwriting core system files with arbitrary data and executing them is a classic malicious tactic, potentially allowing backdoors or sabotage. The pattern is consistent across multiple reports, and the behavior is dangerous. The scores of malware (~0.9), obfuscation (~0.8), and security risk (~0.9) are justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates highly malicious behavior by modifying core Python library source files, which can compromise system integrity. The obfuscation and environment-controlled execution further suggest malicious intent. The overall security risk is extremely high, and the package should be considered malicious.",
