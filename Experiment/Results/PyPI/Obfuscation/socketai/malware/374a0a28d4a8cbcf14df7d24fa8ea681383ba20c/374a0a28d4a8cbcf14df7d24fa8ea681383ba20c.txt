      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code demonstrates highly malicious behavior by modifying core Python library source files, which can compromise system integrity. The obfuscation and environment-controlled execution further suggest malicious intent. The overall security risk is extremely high, and the package should be considered malicious."

The obfuscation raises suspicion but is not indicative of malicious behavior. Overall, the security risk is low, and the malware score is zero."
