  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted input or data.",
  "flows": "Reading file content for description, passing setup parameters to setuptools.setup().",
  "anomalies": "Use of non-descriptive, seemingly random variable names; no signs of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. No obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup procedures: importing 'setup' and 'find_packages' from setuptools, reading a README file for the long description, defining package metadata, and calling setup() with these parameters. Variable names are obfuscated but do not appear malicious. No suspicious code, network activity, or data leakage observed. The code appears to be a legitimate setup script with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python project, with no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The obfuscated variable names are likely a code style choice but do not affect security.",
