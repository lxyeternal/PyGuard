  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.rst' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Reads external file 'README.rst' -> uses data in setup() call.",
  "anomalies": "The variable names are obfuscated or randomly generated, but this is not malicious by itself. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code found. The code is straightforward setup script with obfuscated variable names.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setup' and 'find_packages' from setuptools. It assigns various string values, including package name, description, version, and reads 'README.rst' for the long description. The setup() function is called with a dictionary of package metadata. Variable names are non-descriptive, possibly obfuscated, but the code performs standard setup tasks. No external connections, no data leaks, no suspicious behavior. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation tactics beyond variable naming are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script with obfuscated variable names but no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
