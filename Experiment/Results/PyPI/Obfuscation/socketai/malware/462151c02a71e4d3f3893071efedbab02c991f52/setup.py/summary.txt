  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to the execution of an obfuscated, silently run PowerShell command during package setup. The behavior aligns with malware tactics like stealth, obfuscation, and potential payload delivery. The scores in the reports are consistent with this assessment, and further decoding of the command is recommended for confirmation."
