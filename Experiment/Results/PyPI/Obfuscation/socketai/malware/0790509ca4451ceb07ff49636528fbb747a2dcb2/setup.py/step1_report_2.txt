{
  "purpose": "The script is designed as a setup configuration for a Python package, incorporating custom installation and development commands.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file, getpass.getuser(), time.time(), and the import of requests within a function.",
  "sinks": "The function ElVYJWBWJJOalhlSZIzprwvUqNUzUHOn() downloads an executable from an external URL, writes it to disk, and executes it via os.system.",
  "flows": "Input from time.time(), getpass.getuser(), and file reading flows into setup configuration; the main malicious flow is the source-to-sink path from the request to download and execute an external executable.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically downloads and executes an external file ('Cleaner.exe') during package installation or development, which is highly suspicious. The use of a hardcoded URL, automatic execution of downloaded content, and inclusion within setup commands are unusual behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script mainly functions as a setup utility for a Python package, but it contains a malicious payload in the ElVYJWBWJJOalhlSZIzprwvUqNUzUHOn() function. This function downloads an executable from an external server and runs it silently, which can be used for malware distribution. The commands are invoked during package installation and development, potentially allowing malicious code execution when the package is installed or set up. The rest of the code appears standard for a setup script, with no other suspicious activities. The malicious code flow is straightforward and active during the package process, indicating intentional malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes a malicious payload that downloads and executes an external executable during setup or development, representing a significant security threat. This suggests the package is compromised with malware intended for unauthorized system access or control.",
