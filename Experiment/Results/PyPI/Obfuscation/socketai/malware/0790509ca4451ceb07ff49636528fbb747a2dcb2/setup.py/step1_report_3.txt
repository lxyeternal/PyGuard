{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup procedures for a Python package and executes a function that downloads and runs an external executable during installation or development setup.",
  "sources": "The function ElVYJWBWJJOalhlSZIzprwvUqNUzUHOn reads no external input directly but fetches data from a specified URL. The URL request is made within the code, and the download is saved locally as 'Cleaner.exe'.",
  "sinks": "The function writes 'Cleaner.exe' to the local filesystem and then executes it with 'os.system'.",
  "flows": "The code fetches executable content from a remote URL and directly executes it via 'os.system', creating a source-to-sink flow from the network to local execution.",
  "anomalies": "The code downloads an executable from an external URL and runs it silently during package setup. This behavior is highly unusual and suspicious for a package distribution, indicating potential malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and additional libraries like 'requests'. It defines a function that downloads an executable from a specific URL and executes it immediately during package installation or development setup, bypassing typical package behaviors. The function 'ElVYJWBWJJOalhlSZIzprwvUqNUzUHOn' is invoked during the custom 'develop' and 'install' commands. The downloaded executable's filename is fixed ('Cleaner.exe'), and it is run with 'os.system', which could allow arbitrary code execution. The package setup includes standard metadata, but the embedded code's behavior indicates an attempt to run remote code upon installation.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains malicious behavior by downloading and executing a remote executable during package setup, which is a significant security risk. The practice of automatically executing external code during install is indicative of supply chain attack techniques. The overall security risk is high.",
