{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package with custom installation commands, potentially to execute malicious payloads during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package's README.md file and retrieves the current username. It also imports 'requests' within a function to download external content.",
  "sinks": "The function 'ElVYJWBWJJOalhlSZIzprwvUqNUzUHOn' downloads an executable from a suspicious URL and executes it using 'os.system', which can lead to remote code execution or malware installation.",
  "flows": "Input source: the URL in 'requests.get' —> downloaded file saved as 'Cleaner.exe' —> executed via 'os.system' with command 'set __COMPACT_LAYER=RunAsInvoker | start Cleaner.exe'.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names, dynamic code execution via 'os.system' with downloaded payload, downloading executable from a suspicious URL, and executing it with elevated privileges. The code imports 'requests' only within a function, which is unusual but not malicious by itself. The setup script's structure suggests an attempt to conceal malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and reads a README file to establish context. It defines a function 'ElVYJWBWJJOalhlSZIzprwvUqNUzUHOn' that fetches an executable from a suspicious URL and runs it silently, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The setup class overrides install and develop commands to invoke this function during package installation, potentially executing malicious code without user consent. Obfuscated variable names and dynamic execution further raise suspicion. No other malicious behaviors, such as data exfiltration or backdoors, are evident outside this payload delivery.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains clear malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external payload during package installation. The obfuscation and obfuscated variable names suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent. The package is highly suspicious and should be considered unsafe for use.",
