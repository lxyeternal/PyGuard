{
  "purpose": "The code modifies the setup process to download and execute a malicious payload during installation, potentially compromising the system.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable; making HTTP GET requests to suspicious URLs; downloading an executable file; executing the downloaded file via os.system.",
  "sinks": "Writing the downloaded executable to disk; executing the executable with os.system('start ...'), which can run arbitrary malicious code.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' is used to construct a URL request; the response is ignored; on Windows, a payload is downloaded from a suspicious URL and executed silently, all within a broad try-except block that suppresses errors.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function and variable names; broad exception handling hiding errors; network requests to suspicious domains; downloading and executing external files during package setup; no validation of downloaded content.",
  "analysis": "The code is designed to run during package installation, reading environment info, making network requests to suspicious URLs, downloading an executable, and executing it silently. Obfuscation and broad error suppression are typical of malicious scripts aiming to hide activity. The external URLs are suspicious, and executing downloaded files without validation poses a severe security risk. The behavior aligns with supply chain attack tactics, indicating malicious intent with high confidence.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits confirmed malicious behavior by downloading and executing external payloads during setup, with obfuscation and network activity indicating high threat. The malware score should be set to 1, the obfuscation score around 0.8, and the security risk score at 1, reflecting the high severity of this malicious activity.",
