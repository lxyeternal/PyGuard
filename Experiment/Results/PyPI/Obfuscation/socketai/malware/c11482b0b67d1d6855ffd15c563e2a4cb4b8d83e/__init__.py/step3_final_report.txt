  "purpose": "A simple indicator script that prints 'installed' to signify presence or installation.",
  "sources": "No external inputs; code is self-contained with no data reads.",
  "sinks": "Print statement outputs to stdout; no data leaks or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "Function call flows directly from definition to execution, with no external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function name; no malicious code or suspicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an obfuscated function that prints a benign message and then calls it. There are no external inputs, network activity, or data leaks. The obfuscated name may be an attempt at hiding purpose but does not indicate malicious intent. The code's behavior is trivial and benign, serving likely as a placeholder or indicator. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious operations are present. The obfuscation level is moderate but superficial, not contributing to malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with superficial obfuscation that does not imply malicious intent. It poses no security threat and functions solely as a simple indicator. The overall security risk is negligible, and the malware score should be 0. The obfuscation score can be adjusted to around 0.5 to reflect the function name's nonsensical nature, and the security risk remains very low.",
