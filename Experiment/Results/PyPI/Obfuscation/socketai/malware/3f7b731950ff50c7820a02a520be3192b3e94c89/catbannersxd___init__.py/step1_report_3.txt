  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be the import and utilization of standard and third-party libraries, possibly for a Python application or package. No specific functionality is evident without additional context.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported modules and potentially from environment variables or input functions if present (not shown in the snippet).",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data could potentially flow into functions such as network connections, file operations, or system calls if present (not shown in the snippet).",
  "flows": "Not enough code provided to determine detailed source-to-sink data flows.",
  "anomalies": "The code snippet is empty; no suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation is observed.",
  "analysis": "The provided code contains no executable logic, data handling, or identifiable suspicious patterns. Since no code is present, no anomalies or malicious activities can be identified. The empty snippet may suggest either an incomplete fragment or a placeholder file. Without further code, it is impossible to evaluate code behavior or potential risks.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided empty code snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The lack of code makes it impossible to identify any suspicious activity. Overall, the code appears benign, but further content would be necessary for a thorough review.",
