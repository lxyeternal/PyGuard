  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency code snippets for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and anomalies.",
  "sources": "Code snippets, import statements, data processing functions, network calls, environment variable accesses, hardcoded secrets.",
  "sinks": "Network communication functions, file I/O, environment variables, data leaks, system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input sources such as user input or environment variables to sinks like network transmission or file writes.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, unusual imports, suspicious network domains, dynamic code execution, hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "All provided code snippets are minimal, empty, or lack suspicious patterns. The assessments correctly identify the absence of malicious activity, with confidence scores reflecting the limited information. No signs of obfuscation or malware are present. The scores are consistent with the evidence, and the cautious approach is justified given the incomplete data.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets do not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks based on current analysis. The scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary. The overall risk remains very low, with the possibility of hidden issues being minimal due to lack of evidence.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0,
