      "conclusion": "The code is malicious, performing covert system reconnaissance and data exfiltration during package installation. It employs obfuscation and encodes data to hide its intent, communicating with a suspicious external domain. The behavior is consistent with malware designed for stealthy data theft, warranting high malware and security risk scores."
