  "purpose": "The code collects system information such as hostname, current directory, username, network interfaces/IPs, encodes this data, constructs a domain, performs DNS resolution, and exfiltrates the data via an HTTP POST request to a suspicious external server during package installation.",

  "analysis": "The code is designed to covertly gather system information, encode it, and send it to an external server during package installation. It employs obfuscation techniques such as nonsensical variable names and hex encoding to conceal its malicious intent. The external domain '425a2.rt11.ml' is suspicious, indicating potential data exfiltration or malicious control. The code's behavior aligns with typical malware patterns involving stealthy data collection and transmission. The high use of obfuscation, external communication, and execution during setup strongly suggest malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, performing covert system reconnaissance and data exfiltration during package installation. It employs obfuscation and encodes data to hide its intent, communicating with a suspicious external domain. The behavior is consistent with malware designed for stealthy data theft, warranting high malware and security risk scores.",
