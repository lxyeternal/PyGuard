{
  "purpose": "Setup script that installs a Python package and executes potentially malicious system and network activities during installation.",
  "sources": "os.listdir, os.getcwd, socket.gethostname, getpass.getuser, netifaces interfaces, environment variables, and input data such as hostname and network info.",
  "sinks": "requests.post to an external server, socket.gethostbyname, and system environment data collection which can lead to data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "The code collects hostname, current directory, username, IP addresses, and network interfaces; encodes and hashes some data; then constructs a URL and POSTs data to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, data collection of system info, network info, and environment variables; sending data to a suspicious domain; encoding data in hex; dynamic hostname generation; the inclusion of a hardcoded string that resembles a key.",
  "analysis": "The code imports system and network libraries, obfuscates variables, and gathers system information such as hostname, current directory, and username. It uses network interfaces to collect IP addresses, encodes and hashes some data, and constructs a URL with encoded components. It then performs an HTTP POST request to a suspicious domain, which could be used to exfiltrate sensitive system information. The 'setup' function includes a custom install class that runs this code during package installation, indicating an attempt to execute malicious actions automatically upon installation. The code also has hardcoded strings and obfuscated variable names, which are common in malicious scripts designed to hide intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be malicious, collecting system and network info, encoding it, and exfiltrating via an external POST request during package installation. Its obfuscated style and data exfiltration to a suspicious domain strongly suggest malicious intent, likely to track or steal system information without user consent.",
