{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, but it contains additional code that gathers system information and exfiltrates it to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Reads hostname, current working directory, username, IP addresses, network interfaces, and directory contents.",
  "sinks": "Sends data via HTTP POST request to a suspicious domain; also performs hostname resolution which could be used for C2 or network scanning.",
  "flows": "Collects system info (hostname, user, IPs, directories) -> encodes and aggregates data -> sends to external server via requests.post.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names, encoding of host and directory info, and exfiltration of system data to external URL. The hardcoded URL and encoded data transmission are suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with importing modules and defining obfuscated variables. It gathers network interface addresses and system info, encodes sensitive data, and constructs a payload. The payload includes hostname, current directory, username, and IP addresses, all encoded or hashed. It then attempts to resolve a suspicious domain ('425a2.rt11.ml') before sending the data via an HTTP POST request. This pattern suggests data collection and exfiltration, typical of malicious activity. The setup process extends the install command to perform these actions during package installation, which is highly suspicious. No legitimate purpose for such behavior in a setup script is evident. The code uses obfuscation and encoding to hide its true intent, and the hardcoded URL indicates an external command and control or data theft behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs system information collection and exfiltration to an external server during package installation, indicative of malicious behavior. It exhibits obfuscation, data encoding, and network activity that are common in malware. Therefore, this package contains potentially malicious payloads aimed at unauthorized data collection and exfiltration.",
