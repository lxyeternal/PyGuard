{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for gathering system information and reporting it to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Data is read from system environment variables, network interfaces, hostname, current working directory, and user input (e.g., getpass.getuser()).",
  "sinks": "The collected data is sent via HTTP POST request to an external domain ('https://425a2.rt11.ml').",
  "flows": "System information and network interface details are collected (sources), processed and possibly obfuscated, then sent over the network to the remote server (sink).",
  "anomalies": "The code uses obfuscated variable names and encodes system info and paths into hex, which is often used to conceal malicious activity. The domain used for reporting ('425a2.rt11.ml') is suspicious. The code attempts to collect network info and hostname, then immediately makes an HTTP request to an external server, which may be for exfiltration. The presence of a hardcoded string ('p0pxchfxleuaccnk') and the custom, obfuscated functions strongly suggest malicious intent. The script also attempts hostname resolution with a constructed URL that encodes system data, indicating an attempt at covert data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple modules, including requests, socket, getpass, os, json, sys, and netifaces (if available). It defines several obfuscated functions that gather network interface IP addresses, check if IP addresses are within private ranges, and encode data into hex strings. The core of the malicious behavior is in the 'IbFgmpFEDhMzHWjhbPUawifitHTfhrae' class, which extends 'install' from setuptools. During installation, it collects system info such as hostname, current directory, username, and network addresses, encodes this data, and constructs a URL with this info. It then performs a hostname resolution on this URL, which is suspicious. Subsequently, it sends the data via a POST request to an external domain ('https://425a2.rt11.ml'). The use of obfuscated variable names, encoding, and the external communication suggests an attempt at stealthy data exfiltration. The code's primary purpose seems to be to secretly gather and transmit system information without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains malicious behavior intended for covertly collecting system information and exfiltrating it to an external server. The obfuscation techniques, external network requests, and data encoding indicate malicious intent. The package should be considered unsafe for use.",
