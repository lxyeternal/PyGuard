{
  "purpose": "Setup script that collects system information and sends it to a remote server during installation.",
  "sources": "Reads hostname, current directory, username, network interface IP addresses, and contents of specified directories.",
  "sinks": "Sends collected data via HTTP POST request to a remote server.",
  "flows": "Collect system info -> encode and process data -> send data to remote URL 'https://425a2.rt11.ml'.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variable names, hex encoding of data, and sending data to a suspicious domain. The code constructs a detailed system fingerprint and transmits it without user consent. Uses dynamic hostname, network info, and directory listings.",
  "analysis": "The code is designed to gather detailed system and network information, encode it, and transmit it to an external server at 'https://425a2.rt11.ml'. It obfuscates data via hex encoding and constructs a complex hostname derived from local info. The process involves system details, network interfaces, and directory listings, potentially for fingerprinting or malicious tracking. The URL used for POST request appears suspicious and unrelated to legitimate setup activities. The code executes during package installation, which can be malicious if it exfiltrates user data without consent. No evidence of direct malware such as backdoors or destructive actions, but the behavior aligns with covert data collection and exfiltration, which is suspicious in a setup context.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs system reconnaissance and exfiltration of system info during package setup, indicating malicious intent or covert tracking. It communicates with a suspicious domain and encodes sensitive data, which raises security concerns. The purpose appears to be covert data collection rather than legitimate setup tasks.",
