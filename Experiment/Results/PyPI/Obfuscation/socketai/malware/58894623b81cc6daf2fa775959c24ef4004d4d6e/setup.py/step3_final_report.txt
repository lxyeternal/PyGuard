{
  "purpose": "The code downloads and executes a remote executable during package setup, indicating malicious behavior intended to compromise the system.",
  "sources": "The function fvANlKWHyWnjPkjNaclxEHvogQLaielC() fetches data from a hardcoded Discord CDN URL; getpass.getuser() and time are used for system info collection but are not further utilized.",
  "sinks": "The downloaded executable is written to disk as 'FILE.exe' and executed via os.system, leading to potential remote code execution.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the URL (source) through requests.get() to writing 'FILE.exe' (sink), then execution via os.system() (sink). User info and timestamp are collected but not used in the flow.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, hardcoded suspicious URL, download and execution of external payload during setup, and collection of user info not used elsewhere.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a function that downloads an executable from a Discord CDN URL and runs it during both 'develop' and 'install' commands, which are part of the setup process. Variable names are intentionally obfuscated, and the URL is suspicious. The executable is saved as 'FILE.exe' and executed without validation, indicating malicious intent. The collection of user and timestamp data appears to be a distraction or for data collection, but is not used further. The behavior aligns with supply chain attack tactics, delivering remote payloads during package installation. The high malware score (1.0), obfuscation score (0.8), and security risk score (1.0) are justified given the active malicious payload delivery, obfuscation, and potential for system compromise.",
  "conclusion": "The code is definitively malicious, actively downloading and executing external code during setup. The high scores across malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified. The package poses a severe security threat and should be flagged as malicious.",
