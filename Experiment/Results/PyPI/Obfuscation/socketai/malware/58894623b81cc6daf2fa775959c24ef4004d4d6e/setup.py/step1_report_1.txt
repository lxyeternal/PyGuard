{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up a Python package with custom install and development commands, but it also includes malicious behavior that downloads and executes an external file.",
  "sources": "The code reads the user's username from getpass.getuser(), the current timestamp with time.time(), and makes an HTTP request to a suspicious URL to download a file.",
  "sinks": "The downloaded file 'FILE.exe' is executed via os.system, which could run arbitrary malicious code on the host system.",
  "flows": "The malicious flow involves retrieving user info and timestamp, then downloading a potentially harmful executable from the internet, saving it locally, and executing it.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, the download URL pointing to an external executable, and execution of that file via system call are suspicious. The code forcibly downloads and runs an external executable without user consent or verification.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up a package using setuptools with custom commands. In both custom install and develop classes, it calls fvANlKWHyWnjPkjNaclxEHvogQLaielC(), which downloads a file from a hardcoded Discord URL and executes it. The code collects system information such as username and current time, but these are not used elsewhere, indicating potential data collection. The execution of the downloaded file constitutes a high security risk, as it could be malware designed to compromise the system. The obfuscated variable names and dynamic code execution strongly suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains clear malicious behavior: it downloads and executes an external executable from a suspicious source during installation or development setup. The obfuscation, external payload, and execution behavior indicate high malicious potential, making this package dangerous to use.",
