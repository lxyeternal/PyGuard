{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package that includes custom install and develop commands, potentially to execute malicious payloads during installation.",
  "sources": "User input via getpass.getuser(), system time via time.time(), and HTTP request to a Discord CDN URL.",
  "sinks": "Downloading and executing an external executable file ('FILE.exe') via requests.get and os.system call with 'start FILE.exe'.",
  "flows": "User data (getpass), current timestamp, and HTTP request content are retrieved; the executable from the URL is downloaded and then executed via os.system.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names, dynamic execution of downloaded executable, URL pointing to an external resource, and execution of downloaded file suggest malicious intent. The code downloads an executable from a Discord CDN link and runs it, which is highly suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and defines obfuscated variables. It retrieves the current user and timestamp. The key function fvANlKWHyWnjPkjNaclxEHvogQLaielC() downloads an executable file from a Discord CDN link and runs it using os.system with 'start'. The custom classes override install and develop commands to invoke this function during package setup, indicating that malware executes during installation. The code is obfuscated with nonsensical variable names, and the download URL points to a suspicious executable, indicating malicious behavior. No other benign functionality is evident; all actions serve to execute potentially harmful code during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious due to its obfuscated nature, downloading, and executing an external executable from a Discord CDN URL during setup, indicating malicious intent. It functions as a backdoor or dropper, typical of supply chain attacks.",
