  "purpose": "Set up a Python package and execute a hidden PowerShell command if a specific directory does not exist.",
  "sources": "os.path.exists('tahg') check; subprocess.Popen executing encoded PowerShell command",
  "sinks": "subprocess.Popen running potentially encoded or obfuscated PowerShell command",
  "flows": "Check for directory; if missing, run encoded PowerShell command (source) -> execute via subprocess (sink)",
  "anomalies": "Encoded PowerShell command that is hidden and executed without user awareness; no visible parameters or outputs; silent process creation; lack of error handling reveals obfuscation intent",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to conditionally run a hidden PowerShell command encoded in Base64 if the 'tahg' directory does not exist. The command is executed with CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress output. The command appears encoded and could contain malicious instructions. The use of try-except blocks swallows all errors, preventing detection of failures. The setup() call is standard and unlikely suspicious, but the conditional execution and encoded command raise red flags for malicious activity. The obfuscation and silent execution strongly suggest an attempt to hide malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script executes an encoded PowerShell command in a hidden window if a certain directory is absent. The encoding, silent execution, and conditional trigger indicate potential malicious activity, possibly for persistence, data collection, or other malicious actions. The setup function appears benign but is overshadowed by the suspicious subprocess call.",
