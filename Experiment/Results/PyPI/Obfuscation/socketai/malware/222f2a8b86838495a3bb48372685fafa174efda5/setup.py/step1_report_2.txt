{
  "purpose": "This script appears to be setting up a Python package using setuptools and executing decoded base64-encoded code, likely for package installation or configuration.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the __import__ function calls, specifically the base64-encoded string, which is then decoded and executed. It also imports modules like 'setuptools' and 'codecs'.",
  "sinks": "The decoded code is executed via exec(), which can run arbitrary code, potentially malicious or unintended.",
  "flows": "Data is read from the base64-encoded string, decoded to source code, and then executed with exec(), constituting a direct source-to-sink flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on decoded data is suspicious as it allows arbitrary code execution. The base64-encoded string decodes to Python code that imports socket, base64, struct, time, and establishes a connection to '9kn1a-1.stable.adobe.com', indicating potential malicious activity or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' for package setup, which is normal for packaging scripts. It then decodes a base64-encoded string and executes it. The decoded code connects to a domain ('9kn1a-1.stable.adobe.com'), which is suspicious, as it could be used for data exfiltration or command-and-control purposes. The use of exec() on decoded code is a common tactic for obfuscating malicious behavior. There are no other obvious malicious functions or hardcoded credentials visible directly in the visible code; however, the encoded payload warrants suspicion due to its purpose and obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate packaging tasks but uses obfuscation via base64 decoding and exec(), which is typical of malicious code concealment. The connection to an external domain raises concerns about potential data exfiltration or command-and-control activities. Overall, this package contains suspicious activity that warrants further investigation or should be avoided.",
