  "anomalies": [

    "No clear indication of what the decoded code does without decoding it"
  ],
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools for package setup and executes a base64-encoded payload through exec(). The payload is decoded at runtime, suggesting obfuscation. The encoded string decodes to Python code that imports socket, subprocess, struct, time, and sets up socket connection to a remote server (IP: 35.101.9.0, port 35019). It then runs a shell command, potentially executing arbitrary code or establishing a backdoor. This behavior indicates malicious intent, such as remote command execution or data exfiltration. The use of obfuscation, dynamic execution, and the hardcoded IP address are strong indicators of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is intentionally obfuscated to hide malicious behavior, which appears to establish a network connection and execute system commands remotely. This strongly suggests the presence of malware designed for unauthorized remote access or control. The package should not be used.",
