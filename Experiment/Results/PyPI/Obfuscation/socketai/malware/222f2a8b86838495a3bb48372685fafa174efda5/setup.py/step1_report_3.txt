    "Potential concealment of malicious behavior"
  ],
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools for package setup. It then executes an obfuscated code block by decoding a base64 string dynamically constructed using codecs' encoder. The base64-encoded string decodes to Python code that imports 'socket', 'zlbi', 'base64', 'struct', and 'time', and then enters an infinite loop performing network connection attempts to '1knw9qwawznq7.europe-west1.compute.amazonaws.com' on port 35019, sending encoded data. This pattern indicates malicious intent, such as establishing covert channels, data exfiltration, or command and control communications, concealed within package setup code.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated payload that establishes persistent network connections to a suspicious domain, suggesting malicious behavior intended for data exfiltration or remote control. The use of dynamic code execution and obfuscation is a strong indicator of malicious intent within a package setup script.",
