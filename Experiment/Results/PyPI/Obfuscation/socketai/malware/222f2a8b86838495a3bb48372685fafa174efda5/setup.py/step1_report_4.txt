    "The code decodes a base64-encoded string and executes it via exec(), which likely contains malicious payload."

  "anomalies": [
    "Use of exec() on decoded data, obfuscation of payload with base64 encoding, and dynamic code execution",
    "Obfuscated payload that is decoded and executed, which is a common indicator of malicious activity",
    "Base64-encoded code that, when decoded, reveals potentially malicious code execution"
  ],
  "analysis": "The script first imports setuptools for package setup. It then executes an obfuscated payload: it decodes a base64 string using the codecs module, retrieves the encoded string, decodes it to UTF-8, and executes the resulting code via exec(). The decoded base64 string itself, when decoded, appears to be a Python script that imports socket, creates a socket object, and connects to a remote server 'sandbox-35019.portmap.io' on port 35019, which indicates potential malicious activity such as establishing unauthorized network connections. The presence of obfuscation and dynamic execution suggests intent to hide malicious behavior. The package metadata describes a legitimate package, but the embedded payload is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious obfuscated payload that executes hidden code to establish an unauthorized network connection, indicating malicious intent. The primary concern is the use of exec() on decoded base64 data, which is a common technique for hiding malicious actions. Overall, this package poses a significant security risk and should be treated as malicious.",
