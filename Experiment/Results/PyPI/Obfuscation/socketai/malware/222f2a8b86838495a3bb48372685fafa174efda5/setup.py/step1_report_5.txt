  "purpose": "The script appears to set up a Python package named 'raw_tool' using setuptools, but it includes obfuscated code that executes embedded base64-encoded content.",

    "Code imports 'setuptools', then decodes and executes hidden code via exec() with base64 decoding.",

  "anomalies": [
    "Use of exec() with dynamically decoded code, which is a common obfuscation technique.",
    "Base64-encoded string used to conceal malicious or suspicious code.",
    "No comments or documentation explaining the purpose of the embedded code.",
    "The code appears to hide its true intent via obfuscation."
  ],
  "analysis": "The script begins by importing 'setuptools' for package setup. It then executes code that has been base64-encoded and decoded at runtime. This decoded code is likely to contain additional instructions or malicious payloads, as this obfuscation technique is often used to hide malicious behavior. The embedded base64 string, once decoded, may perform actions such as network connections, data exfiltration, or system modifications. The rest of the script sets up a Python package with specified metadata, but the critical concern lies in the obfuscated code executed via exec(). This pattern indicates intent to conceal potentially malicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code uses obfuscation techniques to hide malicious or suspicious behavior, primarily through the dynamic execution of base64-decoded code. While the package setup appears legitimate, the embedded code's purpose is concealed and could be malicious. The overall risk is elevated due to the obfuscation and dynamic execution, warranting caution.",
