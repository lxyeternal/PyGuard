{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, with an embedded obfuscated command possibly intended to execute additional code.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the filesystem ('tahg' directory) and executes a subprocess with a potentially obfuscated PowerShell command.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen call executes an encoded PowerShell command, which can lead to code execution, remote access, or other malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Checks for 'tahg' directory → executes obfuscated PowerShell command via subprocess → setup configuration (less suspicious) → potential malicious code execution",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated PowerShell command with Base64 encoding, running without error handling or logging, attempting to run hidden processes, which are common in malicious scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with a setup configuration typical for a Python package, which is benign. However, it then attempts to run a subprocess with a PowerShell command that is Base64-encoded, indicating obfuscation. This command is hidden from standard logs and executed with no window, which is suspicious. The command may decode and execute malicious code. The try-except blocks suppress errors, potentially hiding failures or malicious activity. The overall structure suggests an attempt to execute concealed code, possibly for malicious purposes, while disguising it as part of a legitimate package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains obfuscated code that executes a hidden PowerShell command, which is a common technique in malicious scripts. The setup portion appears normal, but the embedded encoded command poses a significant security risk. This code likely aims to run malicious code covertly during package installation.",
