  "purpose": "Handles platform-specific file operations, suppresses warnings, displays deprecation notices related to boto3 and Python versions.",
  "sources": "Import from boto3.exceptions, sys.version_info, os, sys, warnings",
  "sinks": "os.remove, os.rename, warnings.warn",
  "flows": "Import of suspicious exception -> function handling file operations -> warning suppression functions",
  "anomalies": "Import of non-standard exception class from boto3.exceptions, heavily obfuscated function and variable names, unusual import path, no network activity",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment setup tasks such as platform-specific file renaming/removal and warning suppression. The import of 'fQpTWXsriYKANYntMYywrhTOAgNjznne' from boto3.exceptions is suspicious because it does not match any known boto3 exception classes, indicating potential placeholder or obfuscation. Variable and function names are intentionally obfuscated, making static analysis challenging. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. The obfuscation and suspicious import are red flags but do not directly indicate malicious intent. The code's primary purpose appears benign, focusing on environment configuration. The overall malware risk score is low (around 0.1-0.2), but the obfuscation and import anomaly justify a higher suspicion level. The obfuscated score is justified at approximately 0.7 due to naming and import patterns. The security risk score is around 0.2, reflecting low active threat but highlighting the need for further review of the suspicious import. Overall, the code is benign but warrants caution due to obfuscation and unusual import statements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily environment setup and warning suppression with obfuscated identifiers and a suspicious import from boto3.exceptions. No malicious activity is evident, but the obfuscation and import anomaly should be flagged for further investigation. The overall security risk is low, with a malware score near 0.1, obfuscation score around 0.7, and risk score approximately 0.2.",
