{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a Python script that imports standard libraries and performs some operations involving environment variables, potentially for configuration or data processing.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, imported modules (os, sys), possibly input functions if present",
  "sinks": "Any output functions, network connections, or file writes that could transmit data or affect system state",
  "flows": "Environment variables or inputs flow into processing functions, which then may output data or execute system commands",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code constructs observed; code structure appears straightforward with no obfuscated segments",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules like os and sys without unusual modifications. No hardcoded secrets or malicious function calls are evident. It reads environment variables but does not appear to send or leak data externally. There are no signs of malicious payloads such as network connections to suspicious domains, file destruction, or reverse shells. The code's purpose seems benign and typical for configuration or utility scripts. Without hidden or obfuscated code, the likelihood of malicious intent is low. No suspicious flows or anomalies detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard script reading environment variables and importing modules without any suspicious or malicious patterns.",
