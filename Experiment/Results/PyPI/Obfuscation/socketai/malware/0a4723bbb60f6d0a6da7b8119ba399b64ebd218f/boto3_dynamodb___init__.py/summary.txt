  "conclusion": "The code appears mostly benign across the reports, with some instances of obfuscation and dynamic code execution that warrant cautious scoring. The main adjustment needed is increasing the malware score for Report 3 due to eval/exec usage, which could be exploited maliciously. Overall, the security risk remains low to moderate, with no confirmed malicious payloads but some patterns that merit attention. Continuous monitoring and deeper static/dynamic analysis are advised for suspicious constructs."
