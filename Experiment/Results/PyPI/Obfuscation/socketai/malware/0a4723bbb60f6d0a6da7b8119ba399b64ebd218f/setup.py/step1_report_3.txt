{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package, including dependencies, metadata, and version extraction.",
  "sources": "Reads the '__init__.py' file within the 'boto3' directory to extract the version number.",
  "sinks": "Uses the 'open' function to read local files; no untrusted data handling or network communication is present.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from local file -> used in package setup; no external data flow or user input involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. The version extraction method is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles package setup with static dependencies and metadata. It reads the version number from a local file, which is a common pattern. No network operations, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The dependencies are standard for AWS SDKs. The code structure is typical for Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It performs typical tasks like reading version info and configuring package data and dependencies. No security risks or malware indications are present.",
