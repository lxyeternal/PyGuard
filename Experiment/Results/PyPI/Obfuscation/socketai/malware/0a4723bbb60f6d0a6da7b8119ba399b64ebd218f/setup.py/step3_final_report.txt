  "purpose": "Standard setup script for the boto3 package, extracting version info from __init__.py and configuring package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads 'boto3/__init__.py' to extract version; reads local files for package data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, network activity, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from local file, proceeds with setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are obfuscated in some parts but no malicious code or behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python package setup script performing standard operations. It reads local files to extract version info using regex, then calls setup() with package metadata. No network activity, no handling of untrusted input, and no malicious payloads are present. Variable obfuscation is superficial and does not indicate malicious intent. The code structure and content are straightforward, with no signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, a standard setup script with superficial obfuscation. No malware or security risks are evident. The assigned scores are appropriate: malware=0, obfuscated≈0.2, securityRisk≈0.1. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
