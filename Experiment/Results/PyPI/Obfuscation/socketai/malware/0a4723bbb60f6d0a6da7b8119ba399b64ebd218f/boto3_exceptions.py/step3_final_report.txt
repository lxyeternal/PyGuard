{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes related to AWS and botocore, primarily for error handling and resource validation.",
  "sources": "Class constructors and message string formatting that utilize parameters such as resource names, API versions, available services, and exception details.",
  "sinks": "Error message strings constructed from input parameters; no external data leaks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (resource names, API versions, service lists) flow into message strings within exception constructors, but no malicious data flow or external communication occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names, as well as message strings, but no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple custom exception classes that wrap botocore exceptions, mainly for error reporting in AWS SDK interactions. Obfuscation is present but appears to serve concealment rather than malicious intent. No signs of malware, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are detected. The message formatting involves resource and service identifiers, which could be sensitive if derived from untrusted sources, but in this isolated context, no vulnerabilities are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of obfuscated exception classes for AWS SDK error handling, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security threats. The obfuscation level is notable but not inherently malicious. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score remains at 0.",
