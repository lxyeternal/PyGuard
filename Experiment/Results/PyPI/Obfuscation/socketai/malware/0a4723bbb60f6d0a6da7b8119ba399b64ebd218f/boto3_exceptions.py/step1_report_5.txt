{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define a series of custom exception classes and error handling structures related to boto3 and botocore, potentially to manage AWS SDK errors and conditions.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings and parameters passed to exception constructors; no external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write untrusted data or perform external calls; it only constructs error messages and raises exceptions.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows are evident; the exception messages are generated from static or method parameters, without external input influence.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes heavily obfuscated class names and variables, with no meaningful identifiers. The presence of classes derived from exceptions and custom error messages is normal, but the naming and structure suggest possible obfuscation. No hardcoded credentials or malicious payloads are found.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class definitions inheriting from standard exceptions and custom exceptions, with some custom message formatting. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious system calls are detected. The obfuscation of class and variable names could be an attempt to hide intent, but based solely on the code content, there is no malicious activity or supply chain attack. It appears to be error handling boilerplate, possibly auto-generated or intentionally obscured.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks; it is mainly composed of custom exception classes with obfuscated identifiers. No evidence of malware, data exfiltration, or supply chain sabotage is present.",
