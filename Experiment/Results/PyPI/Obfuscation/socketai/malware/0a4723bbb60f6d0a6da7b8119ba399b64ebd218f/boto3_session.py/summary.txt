  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation and dynamic registration of SDK methods, which could be exploited for malicious purposes such as backdoors or SDK manipulation. While no explicit malicious payloads are detected, the suspicious structure and obfuscation justify a high security concern. The overall assessment indicates a moderate to high risk, with potential for malicious misuse if exploited."
