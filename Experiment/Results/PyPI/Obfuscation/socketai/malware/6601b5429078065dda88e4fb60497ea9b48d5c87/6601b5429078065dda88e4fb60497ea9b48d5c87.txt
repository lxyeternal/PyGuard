      "conclusion": "The code is highly obfuscated and structurally suspicious, with an entry point that could execute malicious code. While no direct malicious payload is visible, the obfuscation and suspicious configuration justify a malware score of approximately 0.5 and a security risk score around 0.6. Caution is advised, and further analysis of the 'reqwests' module and its 'main' function is necessary before use."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily dependent on the content of the imported 'main' function. The current scores are appropriate; no further action is necessary based solely on this snippet."

      "conclusion": "The code is a highly suspicious reverse shell with obfuscation techniques, hardcoded malicious domain, and immediate execution of decoded payload. The high malware and risk scores are justified, indicating a high probability of malicious intent. It should be classified as a severe security threat."
