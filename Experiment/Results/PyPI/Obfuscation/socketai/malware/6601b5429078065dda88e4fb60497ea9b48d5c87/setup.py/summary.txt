  "conclusion": "The code is highly obfuscated and structurally suspicious, with an entry point that could execute malicious code. While no direct malicious payload is visible, the obfuscation and suspicious configuration justify a malware score of approximately 0.5 and a security risk score around 0.6. Caution is advised, and further analysis of the 'reqwests' module and its 'main' function is necessary before use."
