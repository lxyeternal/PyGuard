{
  "purpose": "Establish a reverse shell connection to a remote server and execute a command decoded from base32 encoding.",
  "sources": "socket connection to remote server, base64-decoded command, environment variables and socket fileno for input/output redirection.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.call executing decoded command, socket connection sending and receiving data, file descriptor duplication for input/output redirection.",
  "flows": "socket connection receives commands or data, stdin/out/err redirected to socket, subprocess executes a command decoded from base32, potentially allowing remote command execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated command (base32 with replaced characters), redirection of process I/O to socket, no clear logging or validation, connection to suspicious domain, and use of hardcoded decode string with suspicious replacement characters.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a socket connection to a specific domain, redirects process input/output/error to this socket, decodes a base32 string with embedded exclamation marks replaced by 'G', and executes the resulting command via subprocess. The decoding step and connection to a remote server suggest an attempt to establish a covert communication channel or a reverse shell. The code's purpose appears to be remote command execution controlled by an external entity, indicating malicious intent. The use of obfuscation techniques and direct system calls without validation reinforce suspicion of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script functions as a reverse shell that connects to a remote server, redirects standard streams to this connection, and executes a decoded command. These behaviors are consistent with malware designed for remote control, data exfiltration, or system compromise. High likelihood of malicious intent.",
