  "purpose": "Import the main function from the local index module, likely for execution or further use within the package.",
  "sources": "The code imports a function from a local module (.index). No input or data reading occurs here.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow visible beyond the import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only performing an import; no suspicious or unusual code constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement for a local module's 'main' function. It does not include any data processing, user input, network activity, or other behavior that could be malicious. Without additional context or code, there are no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward import statement with no apparent malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger program that uses the imported function elsewhere.",
