  "purpose": "Import a function named 'main' from a local module 'index' to be used in the current module.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; the local module 'index' and its 'main' function.",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of 'main' when called; no data sinks are directly involved in this line.",
  "flows": "The imported 'main' function can be invoked elsewhere, potentially executing code that could be malicious depending on its implementation.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is a straightforward import statement with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'main' from a local module 'index'. It is a standard Python import with no embedded commands, data handling, or obfuscation. The security assessment depends on the content of 'index' and 'main', which are not provided. The code itself shows no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1) are appropriate given the minimal and benign nature of this import statement. The confidence in benignity is high, but the potential risk hinges on the imported module's content, which cannot be assessed here.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily dependent on the content of the imported 'main' function. The current scores are appropriate; no further action is necessary based solely on this snippet.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
