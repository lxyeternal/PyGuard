{
  "purpose": "Importing the main function from the index module, likely for execution or further use.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the local module 'index' when imported or executed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to external systems or untrusted sources are present in this line.",
  "flows": "Import statement does not create any data flow; it only references a local module.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious variables, or hidden behaviors detected; the code is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function 'main' from a relative module 'index'. There are no embedded or executed commands, no hardcoded secrets, and no network activity. It is a simple import statement that is common in Python projects. Since it is only a single line, there are no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The code's behavior depends on what 'main' does, which is not provided here.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this line, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be a standard import statement. Without additional context, the code is safe.",
