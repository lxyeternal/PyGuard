  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the details, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: `from .index import main`.\n- The reports uniformly assess this as benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1, some 0.8-0.9), reflecting certainty that this code is harmless.\n- Malware scores are all 0, aligning with the assessment that there's no malicious behavior.\n- Security risk scores are very low (mostly 0.1), consistent with the benign nature of a simple import statement.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Checks:\n\n**1. Code presence:**  \nThe code `from .index import main` is present in all reports. It is a straightforward import statement, no errors or anomalies are noted.\n\n**2. Malicious behavior:**  \nNo evidence or suspicion of malicious activity. The code is purely structural, importing a function from a local module.\n\n**3. Obfuscation:**  \nNo obfuscation or suspicious constructs are identified. The code is clear and standard.\n\n**4. Data flow and sinks:**  \nNo data flow, external data handling, or sinks are involved in this line.\n\n**5. Context dependency:**  \nAll reports correctly note that the behavior depends on what the imported `main` does, which is not provided here. But based solely on this line, no issues are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation of scores:\n\n- **Confidence:**  \nMost reports assign high confidence (1), which is appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n\n- **Obfuscated:**  \nAll are 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n\n- **Malware:**  \nAll are 0, matching the assessment that there's no malicious intent.\n\n- **SecurityRisk:**  \nMostly 0.1, which is very low and acceptable for such a benign import statement.\n\n---\n\n### Critical points:\n\n- The only report with a slightly lower confidence (0.8) and a security risk of 0.1 is still reasonable, given the minimal context.\n- The report that assigns a security risk of 0.1 mentions \"reading data from the local module\" — which is a benign description, as import statements do not read data at runtime.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- **Scores:**  \nGiven the consistent benign assessment, I would keep the malware score at **0** and the obfuscated score at **0**.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \nSince this is a simple import, a risk score of **0.1** seems appropriate, reflecting very low risk but acknowledging that the imported code could, in theory, be malicious if the module is compromised. But based on the snippet alone, it's safe to assign **0** or **0.1**; the current scores are reasonable.\n\n- **Justification for any higher scores:**  \nNo justification exists for higher malware or obfuscation scores. The code is straightforward and standard.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on all reports and the code snippet:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (or possibly 0, but 0.1 is acceptable given the low but non-zero risk in import statements)\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the consensus in the reports.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The current scores are appropriate; I would not recommend significant changes.",
