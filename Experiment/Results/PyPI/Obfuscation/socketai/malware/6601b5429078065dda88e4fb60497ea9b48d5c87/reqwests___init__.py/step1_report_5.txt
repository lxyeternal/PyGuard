  "purpose": "Import the 'main' function or object from the local module 'index'.",
  "sources": "Import statement reading from a local module file 'index'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Import statement loads code from 'index' module; no data flow from external untrusted sources evident.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code present; no anomalies or suspicious behavior detected. The import is standard Python practice.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains an import statement importing 'main' from a local module 'index'. There are no indications of malicious behavior, no hardcoded credentials, data leaks, or malicious code. No obfuscated or unusual code patterns are present. Since this is only an import statement, it does not itself execute or perform any malicious actions. The risk level is inherently low, assuming the imported module is safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import statement with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears to be a standard part of a larger program structure.",
