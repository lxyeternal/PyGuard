{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, but it contains malicious behavior intended to clone repositories, create directories, rename files, and execute an external program without user consent.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (os.environ), OS login name (os.getlogin()), list directory contents (os.listdir), cloning Git repositories (git.Git().clone), reading/writing files (os.rename), starting an executable (os.startfile).",
  "sinks": "Executing external files (os.startfile), cloning repositories from URLs, creating directories, renaming files in startup directories.",
  "flows": "Environment variables / OS login name -> Directory paths & file operations -> Cloning external repositories -> Renaming files -> Executing an external executable.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual directory creation in startup folders, cloning repositories from suspicious URLs, renaming files in startup directories, executing an external 'main.exe' file from a user directory, obfuscated class and variable names, code constructs designed to hide intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that overrides the 'LfjFcTHLAqdzRVtaVqptlIQBleyTUpQF' method, which performs several malicious actions: creating directories in startup folders, cloning repositories from potentially malicious URLs, moving script files into startup directories, and executing an external executable. These actions aim to persist malicious code on the user's system and potentially exfiltrate data or perform harmful operations. The code uses obfuscated class and variable names, likely to evade detection. The setup configuration at the end specifies dependencies but does not mitigate the underlying malicious actions. The actions are coordinated to achieve persistence, code execution, and possibly data exfiltration, indicating highly malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, designed to clone repositories, create persistence mechanisms, and execute external code without user consent. It poses significant security risks and should not be used.",
