{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to modify the system environment and filesystem, clone malicious repositories, rename files, and execute an external executable, likely to establish persistence or execute malicious payloads.",
  "sources": "Reads system login information (os.getlogin()), filesystem paths, environment variables, and data from the cloned repositories.",
  "sinks": "Creates directories and files in startup folders, executes external executable files (main.exe), and renames files, potentially to maintain persistence or execute malicious code.",
  "flows": "Uses system login to construct paths -> clones repositories from URLs -> moves files within startup directories -> executes external payload.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names; cloning repositories from suspicious URLs; creating directories in startup folders; executing an external .exe file from a user directory; renaming files in startup directories; modifying startup folders to ensure persistence.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by defining a custom install class that overrides the install method. Within this method, it modifies environment variables and clones two Git repositories from potentially malicious sources into system startup directories. It then renames a file in a startup directory to a different filename, and finally executes an external executable from a user directory. These actions suggest an intent to establish persistence, run malicious payloads, or compromise the system at startup. The use of obfuscated class and variable names indicates an attempt to hide malicious intent. The code interacts with system directories, clones external repositories from suspicious URLs, and runs an executable, all of which are typical indicators of malicious behavior in supply chain attacks.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits multiple malicious behaviors including establishing persistence, executing external payloads, and downloading potentially malicious repositories. It is highly suspicious and likely malicious, aiming to compromise system security.",
