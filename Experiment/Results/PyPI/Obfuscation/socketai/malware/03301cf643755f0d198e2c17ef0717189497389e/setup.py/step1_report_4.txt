  ],
  "analysis": "The code overrides the 'install' command to execute malicious actions during package installation. It sets an environment variable, imports the 'git' library, and clones two remote repositories from suspicious URLs into system startup directories. It then renames a file to a 'test.py' script within a startup folder, which suggests persistence mechanisms. Finally, it executes an 'exe' file from a startup subdirectory. The code relies on 'os.getlogin()' for user-specific paths, and the URLs used for cloning are malicious-looking. The obfuscated class and method names further suggest malicious intent. These actions could lead to persistent malware infection, remote control, or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious and malicious. It clandestinely downloads repositories from untrusted sources, installs files into startup folders for persistence, and executes potentially malicious binaries. Its obfuscation and behavior strongly indicate malicious intent intended to compromise the system.",
