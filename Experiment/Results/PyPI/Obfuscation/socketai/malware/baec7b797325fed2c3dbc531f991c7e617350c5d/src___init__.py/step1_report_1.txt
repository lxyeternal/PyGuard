{
  "purpose": "The code appears to provide a collection of utility functions and classes for terminal manipulation, text styling, and animation effects, likely intended for creating styled terminal output or GUIs in command-line interfaces.",
  "sources": "Data is read from user input (e.g., input()), terminal size queries, and internal variables. There are no external data sources or network requests.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include terminal output via stdout.write() and print(), and execution of arbitrary commands through _system() calls in the OS-dependent class methods.",
  "flows": "The code flows include reading user input, terminal size, and style data; then processing and styling text with functions and classes that generate styled text or animations; occasionally executing system commands or manipulating cursor visibility.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically decodes and executes base64-encoded payloads, which can be malicious if the payload contains harmful code. The initial base64 string is decoded and executed with 'exec', which can run arbitrary code. There are several functions with obfuscated or overly complex implementations, possibly to conceal malicious behavior or logic. Use of 'exec' on decoded data and dynamic command execution via _system() are suspicious. Many functions are highly dynamic and could be used to run malicious code or perform harmful operations.",
  "analysis": "The code includes obfuscated import of a base64-encoded string decoded and executed via 'exec'. This pattern is common in malicious scripts to hide payloads. The payload is a base64-encoded string that, when decoded, imports modules, and then executes more code dynamically. The presence of 'exec' with decoded base64 data indicates a high risk of malicious activity. Additionally, the code contains functions that manipulate the console, print styled or animated text, and execute system commands, which could be exploited for malicious purposes like keylogging, data exfiltration, or system disruption. No explicit malicious payloads are evident from static analysis outside the decoded base64 payload, but the initial decoding and execution is a significant red flag. The rest of the code appears to be utility functions, some of which might be used to disguise or facilitate malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains a malicious component via dynamic execution of a base64-encoded payload, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. While the surrounding code appears to be utility functions for terminal styling and animation, the initial obfuscated payload is highly suspicious and could execute harmful code upon runtime. Overall, this package exhibits high malicious behavior potential due to the encoded payload and the ability to run arbitrary system commands and modify terminal output.",
