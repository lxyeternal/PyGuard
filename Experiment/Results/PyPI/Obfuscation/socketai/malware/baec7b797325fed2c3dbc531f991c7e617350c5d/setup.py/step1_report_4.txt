  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'f6x6fdzinvf89o8w' with dependencies and metadata, including obfuscated code that appears to be involved in some form of data decoding and dynamic execution.",
  "sources": "Base64 decoding and dynamic execution via 'exec' of decoded code, importing modules and reading metadata variables.",
  "sinks": "Execution of dynamically decoded code using 'exec', which may run arbitrary code. Also, potential for code to read environment variables or network resources indirectly.",
  "flows": "Base64 decoded string is compiled and executed dynamically, which could lead to arbitrary code execution if the decoded content is malicious.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding combined with 'exec' and 'compile' indicates obfuscation. Variable names are non-descriptive, and the code contains a base64 string that, when decoded, executes additional code. The base64 string is large and appears to contain an obfuscated payload.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with importing 'os' and executing a dynamically decoded and compiled base64-encoded string, which is a common obfuscation technique. This string decodes to code that imports 'tempfile' and 'base64', writes data to a temporary file, and performs network requests using 'urllib'. The code also uses 'exec' on decoded content, which allows arbitrary code execution. The package setup information appears legitimate, but the presence of obfuscated code that dynamically executes external code is suspicious. The code could potentially download or run malicious scripts during installation or runtime. The rest of the code involves standard setup procedures but is overshadowed by the obfuscated segment.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains obfuscated code that executes dynamically decoded content, which is highly suspicious and indicates potential malicious intent. This could be used for downloading, executing, or communicating with malicious servers or executing hidden payloads during installation or runtime. The package should be considered unsafe until the decoded payload is explicitly analyzed, as the obfuscation hides potentially malicious behavior.",
