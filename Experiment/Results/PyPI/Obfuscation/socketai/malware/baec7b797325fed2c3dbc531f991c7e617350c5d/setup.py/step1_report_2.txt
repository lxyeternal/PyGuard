  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package related to YouTube and Twitch botting activities.",
  "sources": "Base64-encoded string decoded and executed via dynamic import and exec, and environment variables via os module.",
  "sinks": "exec with dynamically compiled code from base64, potentially executing malicious payloads; use of imports and dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Base64 string decoded -> compiled -> executed via exec -> potentially malicious code runs within the interpreter.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated code through base64 encoding and dynamic execution; variable names are non-descriptive; code heavily relies on runtime code generation and execution, which is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing 'os' and then performs a dynamic import of builtins to execute code constructed from a base64-encoded string. The base64 string decodes to Python code that imports modules, including 'tempfile', 'sys', 'os', 'urllib.request', and defines functions involving URL requests. It also creates a mechanism to download and execute additional code from external URLs, indicating potential malicious activity. The setup function at the end suggests this is a package setup script, but the use of obfuscation and dynamic code execution significantly raises suspicion of malicious intent or backdoor functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code employs obfuscation techniques such as base64 encoding and dynamic execution, which are common in malicious scripts. It appears designed to download and execute code from external sources, representing a high risk of malicious behavior. The primary concern is the dynamic, obfuscated execution flow and the potential for unauthorized actions. Therefore, this package exhibits a high malicious potential.",
