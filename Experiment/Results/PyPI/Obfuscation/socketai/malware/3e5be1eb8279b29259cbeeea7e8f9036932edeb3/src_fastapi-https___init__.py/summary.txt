  "malware_score": 0.95,
  "security_risk": 0.95,

  "confidence": 0.95,
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, employing heavy obfuscation, dynamic payload execution, and system/network modules typical of malware. It is designed to conceal its true payload and perform unauthorized actions on the host system. The high scores across malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified based on the analysis."
