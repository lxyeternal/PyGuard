{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a straightforward utility script, likely handling environment variables and function arguments for data processing or configuration purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads input from environment variables and function parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes to system files, network, or outputs, but no explicit sinks are identified.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables and parameters to outputs or processing functions without suspicious redirection.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns detected. No dynamic code execution or suspicious imports observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is described as a benign utility script with standard data handling. Multiple reviews agree on the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. Confidence in benign nature is high (around 0.9). No suspicious network activity, code injection, or backdoors are indicated. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the analysis and typical for such utility code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk score reflects minimal concern, and the malware score of 0 is appropriate. Overall, the code is safe for use in supply chain contexts.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.1,
