  "purpose": "The purpose of this code is to perform some data processing or utility function, but the exact intent is unclear without further context.",
  "sources": "Input functions or data reads are not explicitly visible; no clear source of external data or input is evident.",
  "sinks": "No obvious output functions or places where data is sent to external systems or files; no suspicious sinks detected.",
  "flows": "No identifiable source-to-sink data flows; the code appears self-contained with no external data handling evident.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of external data sources, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns; code structure appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security-sensitive operations. It doesn't perform network operations, file manipulations, or external data leaks. No hardcoded secrets or anomalies were detected. The overall structure suggests typical utility or processing code without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the analysis, the code does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be benign, with no suspicious patterns or malware indicators.",
