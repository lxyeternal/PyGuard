{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be setting up a Python package with a name and version, and then executing a function that initiates a reverse shell connection.",
  "sources": "The function nqplkXDLBtGbpwiuBspOhnTFheCLUDkZ() which is called at the end, reads no external input but executes a system command.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call that runs a bash command to establish a reverse shell connection to IP 81.46.246.181 on port 4444.",
  "flows": "The function nqplkXDLBtGbpwiuBspOhnTFheCLUDkZ() is called after setup, directly executing the reverse shell command which connects to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "The function name is obfuscated and cryptic. The code contains a reverse shell payload, which is unusual and suspicious in a package setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports os and setuptools, then defines a function with an obfuscated name that executes a bash reverse shell command, connecting to an external IP address. This function is immediately invoked after the setup call, leading to the execution of malicious network activity upon installation or execution of the package. The reverse shell allows remote control of the host, indicating malicious intent. The code does not handle any input, and the malicious command is hardcoded, with no safeguards or checks. The overall structure suggests intent to create a backdoor.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, executing a reverse shell to an external IP upon execution. The obfuscated function name and the network connection strongly suggest malicious behavior intended to compromise the host system.",
