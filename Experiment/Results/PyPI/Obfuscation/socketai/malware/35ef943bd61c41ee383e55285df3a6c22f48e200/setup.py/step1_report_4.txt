{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that, upon execution, attempts to establish a reverse shell connection to a remote IP address.",
  "sources": "The function nqplkXDLBtGbpwiuBspOhnTFheCLUDkZ() which calls os.system() to execute a bash command.",
  "sinks": "os.system() executing a bash command that connects to an external IP address, potentially exfiltrating data or creating a backdoor.",
  "flows": "Function call nqplkXDLBtGbpwiuBspOhnTFheCLUDkZ() triggers os.system(), which runs the reverse shell command, establishing an external connection.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a highly obfuscated function name, executing a network connection via os.system with a reverse shell payload immediately upon script execution, indicating malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script imports os and setuptools modules, then defines a function with an obfuscated name that executes a bash command to open a reverse TCP shell to IP 81.46.246.181 on port 4444. The function is invoked immediately after definition, causing the reverse shell to activate when the script runs. This behavior is characteristic of malicious backdoors or remote access tools. The code does not perform any legitimate setup or package installation activities related to the package's purpose, suggesting its sole intent is to establish unauthorized remote access.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to create a reverse shell connection upon execution, which is a clear malicious activity. The obfuscated function name and the immediate execution of the reverse shell indicate deliberate malicious intent, likely for unauthorized access or control of the host system.",
