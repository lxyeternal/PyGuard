{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up a Python package named 'i7uip2qj8w4pcusf' with version '1.0.0'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package name, version, and dependencies via the setup() function, and executes an external shell command via os.system() within the function nqplkXDLBtGbpwiuBspOhnTFheCLUDkZ().",
  "sinks": "The os.system() call executes a bash command that initiates a reverse shell connection to IP 81.46.246.181 on port 4444, which could be used for remote control or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "The function nqplkXDLBtGbpwiuBspOhnTFheCLUDkZ() is called immediately after definition, executing the reverse shell command during package setup, creating a source-to-sink flow from code start to malicious network connection.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual and suspicious behavior includes the use of a highly obfuscated function name and an immediate execution of a reverse shell command during package setup. The command attempts to establish a network connection to an external IP address, which is atypical for benign setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script imports os and setuptools modules, then defines a function with an obfuscated name that, when called, executes a bash reverse shell connecting to a remote IP and port. This is a clear malicious activity, enabling remote access to the host system. The setup() function appears legitimate but is used here solely as a trigger point for the malicious command. The function is invoked immediately after definition, executing the reverse shell as soon as the script runs. There are no other indications of benign functionality, and the code's structure is minimal but intentionally obfuscated through the naming convention. The behavior strongly indicates malicious intent aimed at remote control or system compromise.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious reverse shell that is triggered during package setup, representing a serious security threat. The package could be used to compromise systems where it is installed, providing remote access to an attacker. The obfuscated function name and immediate execution support this malicious intent. This code should be considered malicious and dangerous.",
