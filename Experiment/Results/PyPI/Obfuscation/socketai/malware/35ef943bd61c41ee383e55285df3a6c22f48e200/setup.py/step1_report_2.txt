{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package and then executes a function that opens a reverse shell connection to a remote server.",
  "sources": "The function nqplkXDLBtGbpwiuBspOhnTFheCLUDkZ() which executes an os.system call",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing a bash command that opens a reverse shell to 81.46.246.181 on port 4444",
  "flows": "The function is invoked immediately after its definition, directly leading to execution of the reverse shell command",
  "anomalies": "The function name appears obfuscated and deliberately convoluted; the code directly opens a network connection to an external IP without any apparent legitimate purpose",
  "analysis": "The code imports os and setuptools, then defines a function with an obfuscated name. This function runs an os.system command that initiates a reverse shell by connecting to an external IP address. The function is called immediately, executing this malicious command upon script run. The setup() function appears to be a placeholder for package installation but is unrelated to the malicious activity. The presence of the reverse shell command indicates intent to gain unauthorized access or control, which is malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains a clear malicious backdoor via a reverse shell triggered during package setup. The obfuscated function name and direct network connection are strong indicators of malicious intent. The package, if installed, could compromise the host machine.",
