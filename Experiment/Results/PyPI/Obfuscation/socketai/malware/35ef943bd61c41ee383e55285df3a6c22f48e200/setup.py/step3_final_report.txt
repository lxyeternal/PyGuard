{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up a Python package but contains malicious behavior by establishing a reverse shell connection to an external IP address during package installation.",
  "sources": "The obfuscated function that calls os.system() executing a bash reverse shell command.",
  "sinks": "The os.system() call executing the reverse shell command, connecting to external IP and port.",
  "flows": "The function is invoked immediately after definition, executing the reverse shell command during setup, establishing a connection to the attacker's server.",
  "anomalies": "Use of an obfuscated function name, immediate invocation of malicious code during setup, and execution of a reverse shell command to an external IP address.",
  "analysis": "The code imports os and setuptools, defines an obfuscated function that executes a reverse shell via os.system(), then calls setup() and immediately invokes the malicious function. The reverse shell command connects to IP 81.46.246.181 on port 4444, indicating malicious intent. The obfuscation and immediate execution suggest an attempt to hide malicious activity. The reverse shell provides remote control capabilities, posing a severe security threat. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 1, securityRisk: 1, obfuscated: ~0.8, confidence: ~0.9) are consistent with the code's behavior. The malicious activity is confirmed, and the high scores are justified due to the severity of the reverse shell payload.",
  "conclusion": "The code is definitively malicious, establishing a reverse shell during package setup. The obfuscation and immediate execution confirm malicious intent. The scores assigned are appropriate, indicating a high security risk. This package should be flagged and removed to prevent system compromise.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "obfuscated": 0.8,
