{
  "purpose": "This script is intended to set up a Python package with specified metadata, but it also includes hidden behavior that executes an encoded command via PowerShell.",
  "sources": "The code reads the existence of the 'tahg' directory and executes an encoded PowerShell command if it does not exist.",
  "sinks": "The encoded PowerShell command is a sink that executes a command without clear visibility. It can potentially download, run, or perform malicious actions on the system.",
  "flows": "Source: os.path.exists('tahg') check → Sink: subprocess.Popen executing encoded PowerShell command if condition is met.",
  "anomalies": "The PowerShell command is encoded, suggesting an attempt to hide malicious intent. The use of subprocess.Popen with encoded commands and hidden window flags indicates obfuscation. The code runs silently without user awareness.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup procedures but incorporates a hidden PowerShell execution block triggered when the 'tahg' directory does not exist. The PowerShell command is encoded, which is commonly used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The code catches exceptions silently, preventing errors from surfacing. The presence of obfuscated code and hidden execution paths strongly indicates malicious intent or sabotage. No benign purpose justifies executing encoded PowerShell commands within a setup script. The script does not appear to perform any legitimate setup functions related to the package, further suggesting malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated PowerShell execution triggered under specific conditions, with no clear legitimate purpose. This indicates likely malicious behavior intended to run hidden commands on the system during package setup.",
