  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package, with an embedded obfuscated script that executes a PowerShell command.",
  "sources": "Reading the file system (os.path.exists), attempting to import modules (subprocess, os), and the embedded PowerShell command string.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.Popen executing the obfuscated PowerShell command.",
  "flows": "If 'tahg' does not exist, the code runs a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen.",
  "anomalies": "The PowerShell command is encoded and obfuscated, which is suspicious. The command appears to be encoded in base64 and executed in a hidden window. The use of try-except blocks suppresses errors, preventing detection. No visible benign purpose for this code.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by importing setup from distutils and then attempts to import subprocess and os modules. It checks if a specific file/directory ('tahg') exists. If not, it runs a subprocess with a PowerShell command that is base64-encoded and obfuscated, likely to conceal its true intent. The command is executed with hidden window flags. The setup() function is called with package metadata, which seems legitimate, but the embedded PowerShell command indicates potential malicious intent. The try-except blocks suppress errors, reducing visibility of failures. Overall, the code contains obfuscated, potentially malicious code designed to execute hidden commands, which is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated PowerShell execution triggered if a certain file does not exist. This behavior, combined with suppression of errors and use of encoded commands, indicates malicious intent. The package may attempt to run hidden scripts or perform unauthorized actions during installation.",
