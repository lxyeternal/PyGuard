      "conclusion": "The code contains a high likelihood of malicious behavior due to the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during package setup. The pattern of silent, encoded payload execution is a common tactic in malware. Therefore, this code should be flagged as malicious or at least highly suspicious, warranting further decoding and analysis of the payload."
