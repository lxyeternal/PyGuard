  "purpose": "Set up a Python package and execute a potentially malicious PowerShell command in the background during installation.",
  "sources": "The subprocess.Popen call executing a PowerShell command with encoded commands, and os.path.exists check.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen call that runs a hidden PowerShell process which could execute arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "The code checks for 'tahg' directory existence, then runs encoded PowerShell command in background, which could be malicious, without user awareness.",
  "anomalies": "Use of encoded PowerShell command that is hidden from user and executed in background. The command appears obfuscated and potentially malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with importing distutils for setup, then attempts to import subprocess and os modules. It checks if a directory 'tahg' exists; if not, it runs a PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with hidden window and encoded commands. The encoded command appears to be obfuscated, likely designed to conceal malicious activity such as downloading or executing remote code. The setup function is called with a generic package name and version, which seems benign but is overshadowed by the background process. The code is structured to suppress exceptions silently, reducing visibility of malicious behavior. The encoded PowerShell command and its execution in the background suggest an attempt to perform malicious actions silently during installation, such as downloading or executing payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains suspicious behavior with obfuscated PowerShell commands executed silently during setup, indicating potential malicious activity. The package appears benign at first glance but includes code designed to run hidden processes, likely for malicious purposes.",
