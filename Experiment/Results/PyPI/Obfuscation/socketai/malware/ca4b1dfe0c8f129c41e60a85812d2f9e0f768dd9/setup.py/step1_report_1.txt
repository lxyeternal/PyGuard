  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that attempts to run a hidden PowerShell command and then sets up package metadata.",

  "sinks": "subprocess.Popen (executes potentially malicious PowerShell command), setup() (publishes package metadata)",
  "flows": "Check if 'tahg' exists -> If not, execute PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen -> Setup package metadata",
  "anomalies": "Use of PowerShell with encoded command string that appears to be obfuscated, attempting to run in hidden window, lack of error handling detail",
  "analysis": "The code first checks for the existence of a file or directory named 'tahg'. If it does not exist, it runs a subprocess executing a PowerShell command with an encoded command string, likely designed to run hidden and obscure. The PowerShell command appears to be obfuscated base64-encoded, potentially malicious. The setup() function then defines package metadata without any apparent issues. The use of subprocess with a hidden window and encoded command strongly indicates malicious intent or malicious payload execution. There is no validation or sanitization, and the command is executed without user consent or transparency. The code structure suggests an attempt to perform malicious activity during package installation or setup.",
  "conclusion": "The script attempts to execute an obfuscated PowerShell command in the background if a specific file/directory does not exist, which is a suspicious activity indicating possible malicious behavior. The rest of the code is standard package setup, but the malicious activity, combined with obfuscation, makes this highly suspicious.",
