{
  "purpose": "Provides thread-safe container classes for caching (RecentlyUsedContainer) and HTTP header management (HTTPHeaderDict), both utility classes without external system interaction.",
  "sources": "Internal data structures (_container), optional dispose_func callback, standard library imports.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data output, network activity, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Data is stored and retrieved within internal containers; no external or untrusted data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Use of dispose_func is standard for cleanup.",
  "analysis": "The code implements well-structured, thread-safe, utility classes for cache and HTTP headers. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or external communication is present. The use of locking, case-insensitive headers, and optional cleanup callbacks are standard patterns. The code is clear, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, utility-oriented, and free of malicious or obfuscated content. The supply chain security risk is minimal. The low risk score (~0.1) appropriately reflects the benign nature of the code, with a malware score of 0 and obfuscation score of 0.",
