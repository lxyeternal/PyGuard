{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions and a class for handling HTTP request fields, including guessing content types, formatting header parameters, and constructing multipart form-data request fields.",
  "sources": "Filename parameter in guess_content_type, value parameters in format_header_param, filename and data in from_tuples method, headers dictionary in __init__ and make_multipart methods.",
  "sinks": "Header rendering in render_headers, encoding in format_header_param, and header manipulation in make_multipart.",
  "flows": "Filename is used to guess content type; values are formatted and encoded in format_header_param; header values are constructed and assigned in make_multipart; headers are rendered in render_headers.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors. The code properly encodes data, follows RFC standards, and uses standard libraries. No hidden or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for content type guessing and header parameter formatting, which are standard and do not perform any malicious operations. The RequestField class manages request data and headers securely, with methods to construct multipart form data. It correctly handles header encoding, quoting, and content disposition. There are no suspicious dynamic code executions, network calls, or data exfiltration mechanisms. All operations rely on safe standard libraries and practices. The code appears to be a standard implementation for HTTP form data handling without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation for managing HTTP request fields and headers. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code operates within expected norms for such functionality.",
