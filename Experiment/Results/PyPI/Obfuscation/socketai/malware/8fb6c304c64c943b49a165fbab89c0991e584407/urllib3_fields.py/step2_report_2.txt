  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is utility functions/classes for MIME types, headers, and request fields, with no malicious behavior observed.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code handles header formatting, MIME guessing, and request field construction safely. The use of `encode_rfc2231` is standard, and no network or system commands are present.\n- **Risk and Malware Scores:** Both are 0, which aligns with the benign analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** The report is reasonable; the code appears safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing safe handling of headers and MIME types, with no malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis correctly notes the absence of external system calls or network activity, and proper handling of Unicode and encoding.\n- **Scores:** Malware and risk are both 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on safe MIME guessing and header formatting, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** The review emphasizes that `encode_rfc2231` is standard and that no dangerous operations are performed.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0.1—this is slightly above zero but still very low, reflecting minimal risk.\n- **Conclusion:** The evaluation is sound; the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing the standard nature of the code.\n- **Assessment:** The report confirms no malicious logic, no network or system calls, and proper encoding practices.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0.1, which seems appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The code appears safe and standard.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Also notes the code's role in MIME and header handling, with no malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent; no suspicious patterns or dangerous operations are identified.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Functionality:** All reports agree that the code is utility-focused, handling MIME types, headers, and request fields for HTTP requests.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All scores are 0, which is justified given the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious data flows.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low (around 0.1 to 0.2), primarily because the code manipulates data and headers but does not perform any external or system-level operations.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code uses standard libraries (`mimetypes`, `email.utils.encode_rfc2231`) and practices for header encoding.\n- No network, file system, or command execution is present.\n- The data flows are internal and do not lead to external systems.\n- No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or supply chain sabotage.\n\n---\n\n### My Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** — Very low, mainly due to potential header injection if untrusted input is malicious, but the code itself is safe.\n\n**In conclusion, the code is benign, well-structured, and employs standard practices for HTTP request construction.**",
