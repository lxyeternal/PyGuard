{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions and a class for handling MIME types, formatting email headers, and managing request body fields for HTTP requests, including multipart form-data handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads filenames for MIME type guessing, header parameters for formatting, and data for request fields. Specifically, filename parameters, header dictionaries, and request field data are sources of input.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include header rendering functions, especially where headers are constructed or modified, and data storage within the RequestField object. No direct untrusted data output or network communication is present in this code segment.",
  "flows": "Input data (filenames, header parameters, request data) flows into functions that format headers or determine MIME types, and then into the RequestField class methods that prepare headers and data for HTTP requests.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns observed. Use of standard library functions for MIME type guessing, header formatting, and string handling appears normal. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard techniques for MIME type detection, header parameter formatting, and multipart form-data construction. It uses safe string formatting, conditional checks, and well-defined methods. There are no signs of malicious payloads, obfuscated logic, or malicious data flows. Input handling appears safe and intended for common email/HTTP request construction.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a typical utility module for handling MIME types and HTTP request fields. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks based on the available content. It functions as part of an email or HTTP request handling library without any indicators of sabotage or malware.",
