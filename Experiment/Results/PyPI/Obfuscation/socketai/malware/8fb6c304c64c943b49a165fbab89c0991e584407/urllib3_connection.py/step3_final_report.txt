{
  "purpose": "The code implements custom HTTP and HTTPS connection classes with SSL support, hostname verification, and socket configuration, intended for secure network communication.",
  "sources": "Hostnames, SSL context parameters, socket options, environment variables for SSL configuration, and network connection points.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, SSL wrapping functions, hostname and fingerprint verification routines, and error handling pathways.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (hostnames, SSL parameters) flow into socket creation, SSL wrapping, and hostname/fingerprint verification, leading to network connection establishment.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Uses standard SSL practices and error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a standard, well-structured implementation of custom HTTP/HTTPS connection classes with SSL verification, hostname matching, and socket options. It handles SSL contexts securely, performs hostname and fingerprint verification, and manages socket options appropriately. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The code aligns with best practices for secure network communication, and the scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with its behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, secure, and free of malicious intent. It functions as a robust SSL-enabled connection handler with proper verification mechanisms. No supply chain or malicious activity concerns are evident.",
