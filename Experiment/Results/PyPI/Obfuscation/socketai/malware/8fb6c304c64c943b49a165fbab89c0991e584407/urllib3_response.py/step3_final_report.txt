  "purpose": "Standard HTTP response handling, decoding, connection management.",
  "sources": "Reads from network socket, headers, original response object.",
  "sinks": "Memory buffers, connection pool.",
  "flows": "Data flows from socket through decoding layers into memory or streamed output, with proper connection cleanup.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured, standard implementation of an HTTP response class with decoding (gzip/deflate), chunked transfer support, and error handling. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows are present. It employs common libraries and practices, and the logic aligns with typical HTTP client response processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, standard, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements. The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate, and the slight risk score reflects the inherent complexity of handling untrusted network data but does not indicate malicious intent.",
