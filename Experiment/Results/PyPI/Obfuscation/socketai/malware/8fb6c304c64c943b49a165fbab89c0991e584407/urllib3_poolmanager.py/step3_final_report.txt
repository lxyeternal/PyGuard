{
  "purpose": "The code manages HTTP/HTTPS connection pools, proxies, and URL parsing to facilitate network requests efficiently and securely.",
  "sources": "Input data includes URLs, headers, proxy configurations, and request parameters from function arguments and external modules.",
  "sinks": "Network connections and requests that transmit data over the internet, including URLs, headers, and proxy details.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from function parameters into connection pool creation, URL parsing, and request execution, ultimately resulting in network traffic.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Proxy handling and URL parsing follow standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard connection pooling, URL parsing, and proxy support for HTTP/HTTPS requests. It uses well-established libraries and patterns without any signs of malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or covert channels are present. The data flow involves typical input validation and request handling. The security posture aligns with best practices for network libraries, with no anomalies or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure implementation of an HTTP/HTTPS connection pool and proxy management library. It exhibits no malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscation. The low malware score (0), obfuscation score (0), and minimal security risk (approximately 0.15) are consistent with its functionality as a standard network utility component.",
