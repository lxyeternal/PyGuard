  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Describes standard connection pooling, URL parsing, request handling, and proxy support. Inputs and outputs are typical for such libraries.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors. Uses standard libraries and patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, low risk, no malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is thorough, and the low scores align with the findings.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar to report 1, standard connection management with proxy support.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. Uses well-known patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard, safe implementation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — reasonable.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and well-justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Focuses on connection pooling, retries, URL parsing, and proxies.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns or obfuscation. Uses typical libraries and logic.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard, safe code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** Well-founded.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Connection pooling, proxy handling, URL parsing.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code or backdoors. Uses standard practices.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, low risk.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — consistent.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar connection and proxy management.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard implementation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — justified.\n\n**Assessment:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, and there's no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, and the code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slight variation (0.1 or 0.2), but all are low, reflecting standard network library behavior.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — very low, typical for well-maintained network libraries.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and reasonable. The code is a standard, secure implementation for connection pooling and proxy support with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No adjustments needed. The overall security assessment aligns with the detailed analysis provided.",
