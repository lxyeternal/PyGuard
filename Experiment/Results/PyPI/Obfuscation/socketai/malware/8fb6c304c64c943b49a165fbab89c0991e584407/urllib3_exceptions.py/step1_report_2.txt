{
  "purpose": "Defines various exception classes used within an HTTP/HTTPS connection handling library, mainly for error reporting, warnings, and specific conditions during HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code imports a future feature and a module for handling HTTP-related objects.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data handling or potential data leaks are present; exception classes are used for control flow and error reporting only.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code solely defines classes for exception handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The code is straightforward class definitions with no dynamic execution or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a hierarchy of custom exception and warning classes related to HTTP and SSL operations. It includes detailed error types for network issues, SSL problems, timeouts, pool errors, and URL parsing errors, among others. The classes are well-structured and do not perform any malicious operations. There are no inputs read from external sources, nor any sinks that could leak data or execute untrusted code. The presence of subclasses for specific error conditions aids in precise error handling. Overall, the code appears to serve as a robust error management framework for an HTTP library without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely consists of exception and warning class definitions for an HTTP client library, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is well-structured and does not perform any dangerous actions. Therefore, the code is safe and does not pose security threats.",
