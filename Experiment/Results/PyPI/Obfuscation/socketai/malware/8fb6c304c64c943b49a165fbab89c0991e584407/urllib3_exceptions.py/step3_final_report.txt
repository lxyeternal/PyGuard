{
  "purpose": "Defines exception classes for HTTP errors, SSL issues, timeouts, and related network errors, serving as a structured hierarchy for error handling in an HTTP client library.",
  "sources": "Error message strings, URL parameters, pool objects, location strings, reason objects, and other context data used during exception instantiation.",
  "sinks": "Error messages and context data flow into exception constructors; these are used solely for reporting and do not process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from source parameters into exception constructors, with no external or untrusted data processed or executed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a standard hierarchy of exception classes for network and HTTP errors, warnings, and related issues. It imports from the 'six' library for compatibility and defines various error types with appropriate initializations. There is no dynamic code execution, no handling of untrusted input, and no network activity or external data processing. The classes serve as error containers and do not perform any malicious actions or contain hidden backdoors. The minimal security risk score (0.1) assigned in some reports is justified as a conservative estimate, but overall, the code is benign and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, safe exception hierarchy for an HTTP client library, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low security risk score is appropriate given the nature of the code. No further action or concern is warranted.",
