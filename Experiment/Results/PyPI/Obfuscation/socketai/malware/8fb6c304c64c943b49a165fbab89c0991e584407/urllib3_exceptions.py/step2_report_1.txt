  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to determine if the issues are present, assess the reasoning, and verify the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines exception classes for HTTP errors, warnings, and related issues. The code reads data during exception instantiation (error messages, URLs, pool objects, locations). No external data sources or dynamic code.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Error messages and context data flow into exception constructors; these are used solely for error reporting, not for processing untrusted data.\n\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. Exception classes are standard.\n\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a typical exception hierarchy for an HTTP library. No malicious activity or security risks are evident.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (correct)  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0 (correct)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n  - Confidence: 1 (appropriate)  \n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusion and scores are accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1—exception classes for HTTP errors, warnings, SSL, connection issues. No external data sources or dynamic code.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing, no untrusted data handling, just class definitions.\n\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies, secrets, or obfuscation. Standard pattern.\n\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a straightforward exception hierarchy, with no malicious intent.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (correct)  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0 (correct)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n  - Confidence: 1 (appropriate)  \n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines exception classes for HTTP, SSL, connection errors. Imports from 'six' and standard exception classes. No external data or code execution.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flows involving untrusted input; purely class definitions.\n\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies or suspicious code structures.\n\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard exception classes for an HTTP client library, with no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (correct)  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0 (correct)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n  - Confidence: 1 (correct)  \n\n**Verdict:** The report is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Exception classes for HTTP, SSL, connection errors, with detailed initializations. Imports from 'six' and standard modules. No external input.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing or untrusted data handling.\n\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies, secrets, obfuscation.\n\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a standard exception hierarchy, with detailed error classes, no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (correct)  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0.1 (possibly slightly overestimating, but not unreasonable given the context)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n  - Confidence: 1 (correct)  \n\n**Verdict:** Slightly conservative on securityRisk, but acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to others—exception classes for HTTP errors. No external data or code execution.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flow involving untrusted data.\n\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies or suspicious code.\n\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard exception classes for an HTTP library, no malicious intent.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (correct)  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0 (correct)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n  - Confidence: 1 (correct)  \n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious code, with a score of 0.  \n- **Obfuscated:** All are straightforward class definitions, so 0.  \n- **Security risk:** Mostly 0, with one report at 0.1, which is reasonable given the nature of exception classes and warnings. No actual vulnerabilities or malicious behavior are detected.\n\n**Final expert estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (a conservative but acceptable estimate considering the potential for misinterpretation of exception classes as security risk, though no actual risk exists)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. The code is standard, safe, and does not pose any security threat.",
