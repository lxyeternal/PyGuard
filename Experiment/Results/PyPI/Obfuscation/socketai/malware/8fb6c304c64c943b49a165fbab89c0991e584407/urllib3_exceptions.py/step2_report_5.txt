  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the accuracy of their assessments, the appropriateness of their scores, and whether any issues are present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines standard exception classes for HTTP errors, SSL issues, timeouts, etc. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity detected.\n- **Analysis:** The code is purely class definitions, with no data processing, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The code is standard and safe.\n\n**Verdict:** The report is correct. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the code's role as exception classes for an HTTP library. No external data handling or malicious activity.\n- **Analysis:** No anomalies or suspicious behavior; straightforward class definitions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is safe and standard.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above—standard exception classes for HTTP/SSL errors, with no malicious intent.\n- **Analysis:** No data leaks, no external data processing, no suspicious constructs.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct, no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Exception classes for HTTP errors, SSL, timeouts, etc. No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** The only deviation is a `securityRisk` score of 0.1, which is very low and likely just a conservative acknowledgment that security issues *could* arise in the context of exception handling, but none are evident here.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The minimal securityRisk score is reasonable given the context; no actual vulnerabilities or malicious behavior are present.\n- **Note:** The code itself does not introduce security risks; the small score is a cautious default.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate. No changes necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above—exception classes for error handling, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity (score=0).\n- **Obfuscated:** No obfuscation detected; all scores are 0.\n- **Security risk:** Very low or zero, as the code is purely class definitions with no dynamic or external data handling.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0 (or possibly 0.05 to reflect the minimal inherent risk in exception handling code, but 0 is acceptable)\n\nThis code is a standard, benign set of exception and warning class definitions for an HTTP client library, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues.\n\n**Summary:** All reports are accurate in their assessments. No modifications or escalations are necessary.",
