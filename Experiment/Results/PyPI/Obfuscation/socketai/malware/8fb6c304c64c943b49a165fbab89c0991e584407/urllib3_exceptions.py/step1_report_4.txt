{
  "purpose": "This code defines a set of custom exception classes and warnings related to HTTP operations, errors, and SSL security, primarily for use within an HTTP client or library such as urllib3.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; the code consists solely of class definitions and imports.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing points; the code does not handle or process external data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input or external data processing; this is purely exception and warning class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors are present. The code is standard for exception handling in HTTP libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code provides custom exceptions and warnings for various HTTP and SSL-related errors, with detailed initializations for error reporting. It imports modules for HTTP client behavior and extends or aliases exceptions to handle specific error cases, such as SSL failures, timeouts, connection issues, URL parsing errors, and security warnings. No data input, external data handling, or suspicious code constructs are detected. The structure is consistent with a standard exception hierarchy for an HTTP client library, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign set of exception and warning class definitions used for handling HTTP and SSL errors. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks within this module.",
