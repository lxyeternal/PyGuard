  "purpose": "This code defines various custom exception classes and warnings used for handling HTTP, connection, and SSL-related errors in a network communication library, likely part of urllib3 or similar.",
  "sources": "Import statements from a package 'six' for HTTP client, class definitions for exceptions and warnings.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data processing, no code execution, network communication, or data handling within this snippet.",
  "flows": "This code does not contain operational logic or data flow; it only defines exception classes and warnings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures are present. The classes are standard and focused on error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code purely consists of class definitions for exception handling and warnings, following conventional Python patterns. There are no data inputs, no network operations, or code execution points. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected. The code appears to be part of a larger library that manages HTTP connections, errors, and warnings, with no evidence of supply chain attacks, backdoors, or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard exception class definitions for a network communication library, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It does not contain any malware, security risks, or obfuscation. Overall, it appears safe and legitimate.",
