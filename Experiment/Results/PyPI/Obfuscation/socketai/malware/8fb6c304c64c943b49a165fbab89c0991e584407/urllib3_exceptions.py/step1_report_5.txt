{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes used for handling HTTP errors, warnings, and connection issues in an HTTP client library.",
  "sources": "None; this code only defines classes and does not read external input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow or untrusted data processing occurs within this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present as the code only establishes class definitions for error handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are present. All classes serve standard error handling purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for exceptions and warnings related to HTTP operations. It imports standard modules and does not include any functions, data input, or code execution that could be malicious. No source-to-sink data flows, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior are evident. The classes are typical for an HTTP client library to handle various error states.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception and warning class definitions used for error handling in an HTTP client context. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risks. It appears to be legitimate and intended for robust error management.",
