{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions for encoding multipart/form-data requests, primarily for HTTP data submission.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from the 'fields' parameter passed to encode_multipart_formdata; boundary is generated internally.",
  "sinks": "The data is written to a BytesIO buffer and used to create HTTP request bodies; no external sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Fields are processed through iter_field_objects, then written to the body buffer, with optional boundary generation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious or obfuscated code, and no unusual data flows detected. Usage of uuid4 for boundary is standard. No external network or file operations are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines helper functions for iterating over form fields and encoding them into multipart/form-data format. The functions use standard libraries and typical data handling patterns. There are no hardcoded secrets, no external data leaks, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscation. The boundary is generated with uuid4, which is appropriate for uniqueness. The code strictly manages data serialization for HTTP requests, with no evident malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of multipart/form-data encoding without malicious intent or security risks. It contains no suspicious patterns, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
