  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for encoding multipart/form-data payloads, including boundary generation, field iteration, and data serialization into a BytesIO buffer.",
  "sources": "uuid4() for boundary, input fields (dicts, lists, RequestField objects), field.render_headers() for headers, data attribute of RequestField.",
  "sinks": "body.write() calls writing headers and data into BytesIO buffer; no external sinks involved.",
  "flows": "uuid4() generates boundary -> iter_field_objects() yields RequestField objects -> render_headers() writes headers -> data is written -> final boundary appended.",
  "anomalies": "Potential header injection if RequestField.render_headers() includes untrusted data, but no actual malicious code or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard multipart/form-data encoder utilizing uuid4 for boundary generation, iterating over fields which can be dicts, lists, or RequestField objects, and writing headers and data into an in-memory buffer. No external network or file operations are performed. The only concern is the potential for header injection if render_headers() processes untrusted input, but this is a common and manageable risk, not an actual vulnerability. The code is clear, straightforward, and uses standard libraries, with no obfuscation or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, implementing a typical multipart/form-data encoder with minimal security risks. No malicious activity or obfuscation is present. The potential for header injection exists only if render_headers() is untrusted, but this does not constitute malicious behavior. Overall, the code is safe and well-implemented.",
