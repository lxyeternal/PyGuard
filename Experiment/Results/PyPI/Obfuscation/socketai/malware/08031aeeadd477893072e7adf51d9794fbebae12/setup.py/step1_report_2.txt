  "purpose": "To set up a Python package named 'gniyr38yjhrpukv5' with specified metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading from system executable path, creating a temporary file, writing obfuscated code into it.",
  "sinks": "Executing a system command to run a file, executing code fetched from a remote URL.",
  "flows": "Temporary file creation -> Writing obfuscated code -> Closing file -> Executing a system command with the executable -> Downloading and executing remote code via URL open.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variable names, writing code that fetches and executes remote content, executing a system command with a modified executable name.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools and system modules. It creates a temporary file with a random variable name and writes a payload that fetches code from a remote URL and executes it. The code then attempts to run the current Python executable with a modified filename, potentially to execute the downloaded remote code. This behavior indicates an attempt to execute remote code silently, which is highly suspicious and typical of malicious activity. The setup call appears normal but is likely a cover for the malicious behavior embedded in the temporary file process.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains clear malicious intent by downloading and executing remote code, with obfuscated variables and indirect execution methods. It likely aims to compromise the system or steal data. The malicious behavior significantly outweighs the benign setup functions.",
