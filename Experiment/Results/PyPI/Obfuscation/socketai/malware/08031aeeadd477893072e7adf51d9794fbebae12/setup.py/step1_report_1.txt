{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, with an embedded malicious payload that executes remote code.",
  "sources": "Reading from the tempfile object where remote code is fetched and written; reading the system executable path; executing system commands.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing remote code; system call executing a process with the temporary file name.",
  "flows": "Remote URL read via urllib.request, written into temporary file, then executed via exec() and system commands.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual obfuscation of variable names; downloading and executing remote code at runtime; creation of temporary files with code that is immediately executed; use of try-except block without logging or handling failures.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools and other modules, then creates a temporary file. It writes a line that fetches code from a remote URL and executes it using exec(). It then attempts to run the temporary file as an executable with a system call, passing the original executable name modified. The remote code execution via exec() is a clear malicious behavior, indicating remote code download and execution, which can lead to system compromise. The code uses obfuscated variable names and hides its intent, further raising suspicion. No legitimate setup process is evident beyond the malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior—downloading and executing remote code at runtime—which indicates a high likelihood of malicious intent and security risk. The use of obfuscation and remote code execution strongly suggests malicious sabotage or malware. This package should be considered dangerous and should not be used.",
