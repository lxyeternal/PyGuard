  "purpose": "Assess the supply chain security of the open source dependency by analyzing code patterns for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code snippets, imported modules, environment variables, user inputs, network/system calls, dynamic code execution points.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file system modifications, environment variable access, eval/exec calls, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or user inputs flow into eval/exec or network transmission points, indicating potential malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval/exec, dynamic imports, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, suspicious data flows, lack of sanitization, complex or misleading variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code in report 1 appears benign with no obfuscation or malicious patterns, justifying malware=0 and low security risk. Reports 2 and 3 lack code, so analysis is not possible, scores are zero. Report 4 describes code reading environment variables and interacting with external resources but lacks concrete malicious indicators, leading to a cautious security risk score of 0.3. Report 5 details dynamic imports, eval/exec, obfuscation, and untrusted data handling, strongly indicating malicious intent, justifying high scores: malware=0.75, obfuscated=0.7, securityRisk=0.8. These assessments are consistent with the described suspicious features, and the scores align with standard security evaluation practices.",
  "conclusion": "The scores and analyses are appropriate and consistent with the code descriptions. The benign reports (1-3) are correctly scored with zero or low risk, while the suspicious code in report 5 warrants high scores. No adjustments are necessary unless further code evidence emerges.",
