  "purpose": "Obfuscated setup script for a Python package with potential hidden behaviors.",
  "sources": "Obfuscated conditional checks, environment variables, filesystem operations, imports, and potentially hidden code execution points.",
  "sinks": "Calls to pip.main(), os.getenv(), os.makedirs(), os.path.exists(), os.path.expanduser(), os.path.basename(), os.path.exists(), os.path.expanduser(), file write operations, and use of ctypes.windll.shell32.IsUserAnAdmin() which can invoke system-level functions.",
  "flows": "Obfuscated conditions evaluate large integer expressions to control code flow, leading to potential dynamic execution of import, environment variable retrieval, directory creation, or file operations based on obscure conditions. Potential data leaks via environment variables, system info, or file contents, and system modifications through os operations and system calls.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated code with complex expressions for control flow, use of obscure variable names, repeated pattern of large integer computations, extensive dynamic string generation via map(getattr(...)), and conditional execution of system calls like os.makedirs(), os.write(), os.close(), os.remove(), and system-level checks via ctypes. The logic appears intentionally convoluted, likely to hide malicious intent or evade detection.",
  "analysis": "The code performs multiple checks with obfuscated expressions to determine execution paths. These include importing system modules, checking for administrative privileges, creating or deleting files and directories, executing system commands, and accessing environment variables—all under complex, dynamically generated conditions. The repeated pattern of cryptic variable names, conditional system modifications, and the inclusion of system-specific calls suggest an attempt to execute hidden system modifications or data exfiltration routines. The code's complexity and obfuscation serve to conceal its true purpose, indicating malicious intent. It uses hidden control flows to possibly execute malicious payloads selectively, and the use of low-level system calls and environment variables points to possible backdoors, data theft, or system compromise.",
  "conclusion": "The script is highly obfuscated with complex control flow designed to hide its true actions. It can perform system modifications, directory and file operations, environment variable access, and system privilege checks. Its structure strongly suggests malicious behavior, potentially acting as a backdoor or system hijacker under the guise of a setup script. The obfuscation, combined with system-level calls, indicates a high risk of malicious intent.",
