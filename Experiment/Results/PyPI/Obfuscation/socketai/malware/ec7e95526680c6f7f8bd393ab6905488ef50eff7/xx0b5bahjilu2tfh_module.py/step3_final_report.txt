{
  "purpose": "The code provides simple utility functions for addition, multiplication, and greeting, with obfuscated function names.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'a', 'b', and 'name' in respective functions.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data leaks; functions return computed values or strings locally.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow directly into return statements without external or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function names; no malicious patterns or hidden logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of three straightforward functions performing basic arithmetic and string formatting. The obfuscated names do not affect the benign nature of the logic. No external calls, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are present. The obfuscation is superficial and does not indicate malicious intent. Scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, low security risk, moderate obfuscation) are consistent with the benign analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility functions with obfuscated names. No malicious activity, data leaks, or vulnerabilities are detected. The obfuscation appears to be an attempt at concealment but does not imply malicious intent. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
