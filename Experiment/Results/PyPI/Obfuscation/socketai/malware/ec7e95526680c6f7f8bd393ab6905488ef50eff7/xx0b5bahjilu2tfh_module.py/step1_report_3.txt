{
  "purpose": "The code defines three functions performing basic operations: addition, multiplication, and greeting message formatting.",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'a', 'b', and 'name' used as input data sources.",
  "sinks": "Return statements output the processed data; no external sinks or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through simple operations and returns; no complex or suspicious data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "Function names are obfuscated and non-descriptive, but the code itself performs straightforward tasks without hidden behavior or code injection.",
  "analysis": "All functions perform basic arithmetic or string formatting without external data handling or system interactions. Names are intentionally obfuscated but do not indicate malicious intent. No evidence of malicious code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior. The code appears benign and simple.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of straightforward, harmless utility functions with obfuscated names. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
