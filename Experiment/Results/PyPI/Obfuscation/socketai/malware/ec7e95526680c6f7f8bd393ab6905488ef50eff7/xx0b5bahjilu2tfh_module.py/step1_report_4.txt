  "purpose": "Provides simple utility functions for addition, multiplication, and greeting message generation.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'a', 'b', and 'name' passed to functions",
  "sinks": "Return statements produce output; no data leaks or external connections observed",
  "flows": "Inputs are processed locally within functions and returned directly",
  "anomalies": "Function names are obfuscated, but function logic appears straightforward and benign; no hardcoded credentials, no suspicious dynamic code execution, or obfuscated malicious logic detected",
  "analysis": "All functions perform basic arithmetic or string formatting without side effects. No external data access, network communication, or hidden code present. Obfuscated names suggest possible concealment but do not inherently imply malicious intent. The code is simple, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign utility functions with obfuscated names. There are no indications of malicious intent, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities.",
