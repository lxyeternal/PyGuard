{
  "purpose": "The code defines three simple functions for arithmetic operations and greeting generation.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for functions: 'a', 'b', and 'name'.",
  "sinks": "None identified; functions return computed values or formatted string, no external data output or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into functions, which then return results; no external data or side effects.",
  "anomalies": "Functions have obfuscated names but contain straightforward logic; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code includes three functions: two perform basic arithmetic operations (addition and multiplication), and one returns a greeting string incorporating the provided name. Function names appear obfuscated, but their implementations are benign. There are no external network calls, file operations, or data leaks. No suspicious code constructs or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be simple, harmless utility functions with obfuscated names, likely intended to hinder straightforward understanding but without malicious intent or security risks.",
