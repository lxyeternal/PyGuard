{
  "purpose": "The code defines three simple functions for addition, multiplication, and greeting message generation.",
  "sources": "Function parameters: 'a', 'b', and 'name' which are inputs to the functions.",
  "sinks": "Return statements of each function; no external data sinks or network calls present.",
  "flows": "Inputs are directly returned or formatted without processing from untrusted sources, no complex data flows.",
  "anomalies": "Function names are obfuscated and nonsensical, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of three straightforward functions with obfuscated but benign names. No data input handling beyond parameters, no external calls, no malicious code or unusual behavior. The functions perform basic arithmetic and string formatting, which are typical in non-malicious code. The obfuscation might be an attempt to hide intent, but on their own, these functions are harmless.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign utility functions with obfuscated naming. No evidence of malicious behavior or security risks identified. The obfuscation alone does not suggest malicious intent.",
