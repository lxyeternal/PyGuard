{
  "purpose": "The code provides simple utility functions for addition, multiplication, and greeting messages.",
  "sources": "No explicit input sources; functions take parameters, which may originate from external or internal sources.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network, file, or system calls; functions only return processed data.",
  "flows": "Parameters are passed into functions and returned after minimal processing; no data flow to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Function names appear obfuscated or intentionally nonsensical; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "All functions perform basic arithmetic or string formatting. There are no network calls, environment variable accesses, or other typical malicious behaviors. Function names are unusual but do not indicate malicious intent. No suspicious code patterns, code injection, or obfuscation techniques are present. The code structure is straightforward and simple.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists of harmless utility functions with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. The obfuscated function names alone do not imply malicious intent; they could be intentionally named this way for obscurity. Overall, the code appears benign.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.2,
