  "purpose": "The code defines a custom installation command that executes a system command and sends data to a remote server during package installation.",
  "sources": "Reads system user information via subprocess ('whoami')",
  "sinks": "Sends HTTP POST request to 'https://vigneshsb.me/test.php' with collected data",
  "flows": "Executes 'whoami' -> collects output -> sends output via POST request to remote URL",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class and method names; executing system command and transmitting data to external server during installation; lack of transparency or documentation",
  "analysis": "The code customizes the 'install' command in setup.py. It runs 'whoami' using subprocess, captures the output, and sends it via an HTTP POST request to an external URL. The use of obfuscated class and method names indicates possible intent to hide functionality. Collecting system info and transmitting it remotely during package installation could be malicious, especially if no user consent or notification is provided. There is no evident reason for this behavior aligned with legitimate package setup procedures. The code does not perform any malicious file modifications but does gather and exfiltrate user info, which is suspicious and potentially malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs data exfiltration during package installation by executing a system command and sending the result to a remote server. This behavior is suspicious and potentially malicious, as it could be used for user tracking or privacy invasion without user awareness. The obfuscated naming and active data transmission elevate concerns about malicious intent.",
