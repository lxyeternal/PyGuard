{
  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to execute a system command and send data to a remote server during package installation.",
  "sources": "The subprocess call to 'whoami' and the hardcoded URL 'https://vigneshsb.me/test.php' for POST requests.",
  "sinks": "The POST request to the remote server which transmits the output of 'whoami' along with package info.",
  "flows": "The code retrieves system information via 'whoami', then sends this data to a remote URL during the install process.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names; code performs network activity during package installation; uses subprocess and requests for data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that executes 'whoami' to gather the current username, then sends this data along with package info to an external server. The obfuscated naming and network activity during install are suspicious. No malicious payloads like damaging files or backdoors are present, but the behavior resembles data exfiltration without user consent, which is malicious in intent. The code’s purpose appears to be covert data collection at install time.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains code that secretly collects system information and transmits it to a remote server during installation, indicating malicious behavior. This is suspicious and potentially harmful, representing a security risk.",
