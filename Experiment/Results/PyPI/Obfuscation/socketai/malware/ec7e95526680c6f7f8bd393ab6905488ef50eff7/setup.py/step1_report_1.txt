{
  "purpose": "Custom setup script that runs a post-installation routine involving system information collection and a POST request.",
  "sources": "Subprocess call to 'whoami' command, network request to external URL",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST request to 'https://vigneshsb.me/test.php' with system info",
  "flows": "Reads username via subprocess -> sends data to external server via requests.post",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names, unconventional variable names, and the network request during installation",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation command that executes 'whoami' to get the current username. It then sends this username along with a package name to an external server via an HTTP POST request. The request is executed during the package's installation process, which can be considered suspicious. The use of obfuscated class and method names suggests an attempt to hide intent. No malicious file modifications or system damage are present; however, the behavior of sending system info to an external server during install poses privacy and security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The script collects system information and transmits it to an external server during package installation. While it does not exhibit direct malicious actions like system modification or malware delivery, its behavior raises privacy concerns and is indicative of potentially unwanted tracking or data exfiltration. This pattern warrants caution and review.",
