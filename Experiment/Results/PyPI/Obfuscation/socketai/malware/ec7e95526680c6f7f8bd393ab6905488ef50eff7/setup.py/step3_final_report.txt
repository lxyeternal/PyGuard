{
  "purpose": "The code collects the current system username via subprocess and exfiltrates it to an external server during package installation, potentially for tracking or malicious data collection.",
  "sources": "subprocess call to 'whoami' to obtain username",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST request to 'https://vigneshsb.me/test.php' transmitting username and package info",
  "flows": "Reads username from subprocess output, sends data via POST request to external URL during install",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names, network activity during package installation, data exfiltration without user consent",
  "analysis": "The code executes 'whoami' to retrieve the current username and transmits this information to an external server during installation, which is suspicious. The obfuscated identifiers suggest an intent to hide behavior. No malicious payloads or system modifications are present, but the covert data exfiltration indicates privacy invasion. The network activity and obfuscation justify elevated suspicion. Scores are consistent with behavior: high obfuscation (around 0.85), significant malware potential (around 0.75), and high security risk (around 0.75).",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits covert data exfiltration during installation with obfuscation, raising privacy and security concerns. While no direct malicious payloads are found, the behavior is suspicious and potentially malicious, warranting a high malware and risk score.",
