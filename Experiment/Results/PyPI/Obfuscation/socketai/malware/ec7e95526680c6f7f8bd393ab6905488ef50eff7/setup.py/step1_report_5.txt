{
  "purpose": "Custom setup script that executes a command during installation and attempts to send data to an external server.",
  "sources": "subprocess call to 'whoami' command, data read from subprocess stdout, hardcoded URL, environment variables (implicitly via subprocess), and request response handling.",
  "sinks": "requests.post to external URL with data gathered from subprocess output.",
  "flows": "The script runs 'whoami' to obtain current username, then sends this data along with package info to a remote server via POST request during installation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class and method names; executing a system command ('whoami') during installation; sending user data over network without user consent; no clear purpose for data transmission; no validation or encryption of data; presence of an unusual class name and method name suggesting obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command class that runs the 'whoami' command using subprocess, capturing the output. It then constructs a POST request to a specified external URL, sending the current username along with package info. The network communication occurs during installation, which is suspicious, especially without user knowledge or consent. The use of obfuscated class and method names indicates potential concealment. There are no explicit hardcoded credentials, but the data collection and transmission mechanism could be used maliciously to gather system info and exfiltrate it. The code does not include any malicious payloads like file modification, data theft, or remote access, but the behavior of sending system info to an external server without transparency is a security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs benign-looking actions on the surface but contains suspicious behaviors such as executing system commands and exfiltrating system data during package installation. The obfuscated naming and network activity suggest potential malicious intent or at least privacy-invasive behavior, warranting caution.",
