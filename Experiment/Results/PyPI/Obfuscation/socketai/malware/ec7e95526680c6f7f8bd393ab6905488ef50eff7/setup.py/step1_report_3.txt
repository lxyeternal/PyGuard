  "purpose": "Customize the installation process of a Python package by executing a system command and sending data to an external server during install.",
  "sources": "Reads system information using 'whoami' command; reads untrusted data from subprocess output; sends HTTP POST request to external URL with collected data.",
  "sinks": "External HTTP request to 'https://vigneshsb.me/test.php' with collected username; subprocess call to 'whoami'.",
  "flows": "Subprocess 'whoami' output flows into the POST request payload, which is sent to an external server during installation.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual use of a custom install command class that performs network communication and system info collection during package install; obfuscated class and method names; sending data to an external domain without clear purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that executes 'whoami' to retrieve the current system username. It then sends this username along with a package name to an external URL via POST request during the installation process. The code uses obfuscated class and method names, which could be an attempt to hide malicious intent. The external request could be used for tracking, data exfiltration, or malicious purposes, especially since it's initiated automatically during package installation without user consent. No malicious system modifications are observed, but the behavior of collecting system info and communicating externally at install time is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs potentially malicious activity by collecting system info and sending it to an external server during package installation. The use of obfuscated identifiers and network communication during install are suspicious behaviors that warrant caution.",
