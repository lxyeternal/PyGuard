  "purpose": "Importing a specific class or function from a local module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a relative module within the package.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; import statement alone does not execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "N/A (only import statement, no data flow or execution flows shown).",
  "anomalies": "The imported symbol has an obfuscated or nonsensical name 'AfYsxROefwUYYZQjXfiqjtAwTRYLwFxT', which may indicate obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a single import statement with a highly obfuscated symbol name. There are no additional code blocks, functions, or logic present. The obfuscated symbol name raises suspicion as it could be used to hide malicious code or backdoors. However, without the actual content of the module or further context, it is difficult to definitively assess malicious intent. The import itself is standard Python syntax, but the unusual naming warrants caution. No immediate malicious behavior or data leaks are evident from this single line.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains only an import statement with an obfuscated symbol name, which could be an attempt to hide malicious behavior or backdoor. The lack of additional code limits definitive conclusions, but the obfuscated identifier is suspicious. Further review of the imported module is recommended.",
