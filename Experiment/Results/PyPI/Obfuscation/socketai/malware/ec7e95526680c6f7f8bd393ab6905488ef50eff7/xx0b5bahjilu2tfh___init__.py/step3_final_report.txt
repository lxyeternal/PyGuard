  "purpose": "Assess the security implications of an import statement involving an obfuscated module or symbol, focusing on potential malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "sources": "The import statement importing 'AfYsxROefwUYYZQjXfiqjtAwTRYLwFxT' from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; potential concern is the imported obfuscated module which could contain malicious code or backdoors.",
  "flows": "The code imports an obfuscated module; if the module contains malicious code, it could execute upon import or later use.",
  "anomalies": "The module name 'AfYsxROefwUYYZQjXfiqjtAwTRYLwFxT' is nonsensical and highly obfuscated, indicating potential concealment or auto-generation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement with an obfuscated name, with no additional code or data flow. The high obfuscation score indicates suspicion, but there is no evidence of malicious activity. The low malware score reflects cautious suspicion based on naming alone. The security risk score is moderate, acknowledging the obfuscation without concrete malicious behavior. The minimal code and lack of behavior suggest low actual risk, but obfuscation warrants further review of the module content. The scores across reports are consistent and justified given the evidence.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement's obfuscated name raises suspicion but lacks evidence of malicious activity. The scores are appropriate, with high obfuscation and low malware likelihood. Further analysis of the actual module is recommended before deployment or trust.",
