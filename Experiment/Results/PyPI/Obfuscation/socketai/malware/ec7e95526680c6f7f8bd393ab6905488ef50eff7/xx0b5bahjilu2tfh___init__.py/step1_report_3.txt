  "purpose": "Import a specific class or function named 'AfYsxROefwUYYZQjXfiqjtAwTRYLwFxT' from a local module",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module file",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or malicious activity within this snippet",
  "flows": "N/A due to single import statement, no data flow analysis applicable",
  "anomalies": "Unusually obfuscated or random-looking class/function name; no context or usage shown",
  "analysis": "The code contains a single import statement importing a possibly obfuscated class or function from a local module. The name 'AfYsxROefwUYYZQjXfiqjtAwTRYLwFxT' appears intentionally obfuscated or randomly generated, which could be a sign of malicious intent or an attempt to hide functionality. However, no further code is provided to evaluate behavior. Without additional context or code execution, there is no evidence of malicious activity. The code is minimal and does not demonstrate any harmful actions, but the obfuscated name warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior. The obfuscated naming pattern is suspicious but not conclusive. Additional code would be needed to determine any malicious intent or security risks.",
