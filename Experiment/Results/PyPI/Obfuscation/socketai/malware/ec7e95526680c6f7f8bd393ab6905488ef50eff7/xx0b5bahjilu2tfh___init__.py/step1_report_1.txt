  "purpose": "Import a specific class or object from a local module within the package",
  "sources": "Import statement from a relative module within the package",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks observed; standard import statement",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static import from a local module",
  "anomalies": "Unusual module name: 'AfYsxROefwUYYZQjXfiqjtAwTRYLwFxT' appears obfuscated or randomly generated, which may be suspicious",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a relative import statement importing an object or class with a highly obfuscated or nonsensical name. No additional code, data input, or processing is present. The module name's obfuscation raises suspicion of potential concealment or malicious intent, but there is no direct malicious behavior or data flow visible in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement alone is not malicious but the obfuscated module/class name warrants caution. There are no overt malicious actions or security risks demonstrated in this minimal code fragment, but the obfuscation suggests further review is advisable.",
