      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious intent, with clear indicators of covert data exfiltration and command-and-control activity. The obfuscation, encoding, and network behavior strongly suggest malicious malware. The assigned scores in the reports (malware: 0.9, obfuscated: 0.8-0.9, security risk: 0.9) are justified and consistent with the observed behavior."
