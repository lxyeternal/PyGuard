  "purpose": "The code collects system information (hostname, user, current directory), encodes it, and transmits it covertly via multiple network requests and ping commands to a remote server, indicating malicious data exfiltration or command-and-control activity.",

    "System info is collected from sources, encoded with base64 and hex, then combined into strings.",
    "Encoded data is used to generate obfuscated payloads.",
    "Payloads are sent via HTTP requests or ping commands to external domains.",
    "Repeated network requests with different encoding segments suggest covert data exfiltration."

  "anomalies": [
    "Heavy obfuscation with nonsensical variable names.",
    "Multiple encoding layers (base64, hex).",
    "Repeated network requests to the same domain with different methods.",
    "Use of multiple modules for similar network activity.",
    "Execution of ping commands with encoded data."
  ],
  "analysis": "The code gathers system environment details, encodes them to evade detection, and transmits the data covertly through various HTTP requests and ping commands to a suspicious domain. The obfuscation, repeated network activity, and encoding layers are characteristic of malicious exfiltration or C2 communication. The use of try-except blocks suppresses errors, further hiding activity. The network requests include both GET and POST methods, and the data is dynamically generated and encoded, indicating an intent to evade detection. The code does not perform any legitimate function and actively seeks to exfiltrate system information covertly.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious intent, with clear indicators of covert data exfiltration and command-and-control activity. The obfuscation, encoding, and network behavior strongly suggest malicious malware. The assigned scores in the reports (malware: 0.9, obfuscated: 0.8-0.9, security risk: 0.9) are justified and consistent with the observed behavior.",
