      "conclusion": "The package contains a pattern of executing external code during installation, which is a significant security concern. The obfuscation and dynamic execution further heighten suspicion of malicious intent. The scores provided are consistent with the behavior. Until 'download_and_run_script()' is verified safe, the package should be considered potentially malicious."

While these obfuscations could be used to hide malicious intent, there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior in the provided code. The scores reflect a cautious stance, with low malware and risk scores but high obfuscation. Continuous monitoring and further review of obfuscated parts are recommended."
