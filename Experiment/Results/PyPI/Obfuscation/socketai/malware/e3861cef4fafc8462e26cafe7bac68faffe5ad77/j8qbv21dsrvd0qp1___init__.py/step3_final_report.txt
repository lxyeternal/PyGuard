  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code snippets, network connections, environment variables, data handling functions, input/output operations.",
  "sinks": "Network communication functions, file write/read operations, environment variable access, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Input sources to sinks through data processing functions, potential malicious data flows if present.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, suspicious network domains, obfuscated code, unusual dynamic code execution, hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The provided code snippets are either absent or benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows. Scores for malware and obfuscation are consistently zero, reflecting the lack of indicators. Security risk scores are low (~0.2), acknowledging some uncertainty but no concrete threats. Confidence levels are high where code is analyzed, and no anomalies are detected. The assessments align with the descriptions, and the scoring is appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "All reports accurately reflect the benign nature of the code, with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores are justified and consistent with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
