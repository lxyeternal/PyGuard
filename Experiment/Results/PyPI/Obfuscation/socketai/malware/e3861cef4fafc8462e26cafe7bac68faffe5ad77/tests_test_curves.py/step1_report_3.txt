{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a set of test classes and functions designed to verify the behavior of supply and demand curve objects and their interactions, primarily for validating mathematical assertions and exception handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from supply_curve and demand_curve objects passed into methods, which are instances of specific classes, and from hardcoded dictionaries representing supply and demand data.",
  "sinks": "The code performs assertions, raises exceptions, and creates objects based on input data. There are no apparent sinks that lead to data leakage or external system interaction.",
  "flows": "Input data (from supply and demand curve objects or hardcoded data) flows into assertions and object instantiations. These flows are typical for test validations and do not indicate malicious data manipulation or leakage.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden malicious code are present. The code uses exception assertions, which is typical in testing. No obfuscated code, network operations, or system modifications are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured set of test cases using pytest, validating properties and behaviors of supply and demand curve objects. The methods perform straightforward equality and exception assertions. The use of deep copy ensures object integrity during tests. The only data manipulation involves typical test data and assertion logic. No external data leaks, system modifications, or malicious behaviors are detected. The code is clearly intended for testing, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign testing suite focused on verifying the correctness of supply and demand curve objects and their interactions. There are no signs of malicious intent, security vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors within this module.",
