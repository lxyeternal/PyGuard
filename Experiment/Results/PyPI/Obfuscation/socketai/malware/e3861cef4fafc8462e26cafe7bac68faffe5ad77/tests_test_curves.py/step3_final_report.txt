{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit test classes for supply and demand curves, validating properties, equality, and exception handling.",
  "sources": "Input data structures, class instances, and method parameters such as supply_curve and demand_curve.",
  "sinks": "Assertions, exception raising, and internal method calls; no external data leaks or network/system interactions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through validation and assertions, with exception handling for invalid data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obscure variable and class names, complex internal method calls, and some obfuscation, but no malicious code or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard validation of supply/demand curves, including deep copies, equality checks, and exception tests. No network, file, or system modifications are present. Obfuscation appears stylistic rather than malicious. No hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads are detected. The assertions and exception handling follow typical testing patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured test suite for economic models, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. Obfuscation is present but not indicative of malicious intent. The overall security risk is very low.",
