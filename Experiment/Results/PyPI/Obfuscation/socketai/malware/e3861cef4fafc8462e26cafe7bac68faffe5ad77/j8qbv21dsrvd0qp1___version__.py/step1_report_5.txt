{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define metadata for a Python package, including its name, description, version, author, email, license, and repository URL.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads external input or data sources; all values are hardcoded string assignments.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could leak or cause effect, as the code does not perform data transmission, file operations, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; all data is statically assigned within the script.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only variable assignments with metadata, with no obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or unusual constructs. No secrets or credentials are hardcoded beyond basic project info.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns string literals to variables representing package metadata. There are no external inputs, no data processing, and no suspicious behavior such as network communication or code execution. The presence of email and URL could be used for contact or documentation purposes, but do not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code appears benign and intended for package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a straightforward package metadata definition with no malicious behavior or security concerns identified. It provides information about the package but does not perform any operations that could compromise security.",
