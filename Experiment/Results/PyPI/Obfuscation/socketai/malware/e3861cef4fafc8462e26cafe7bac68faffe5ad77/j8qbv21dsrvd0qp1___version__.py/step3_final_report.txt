  "purpose": "This code defines static package metadata variables, including name, description, version, author, email, license, and URL, intended for use in package setup or configuration.",
  "sources": "Static variable assignments within the code, with no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or system effects, as the code contains only static strings.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code is purely static assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present; the code is straightforward and metadata-only.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments containing package metadata. No functions, data processing, external input, network activity, or obfuscation are present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate given the code's simplicity. There are no anomalies or suspicious patterns. The code is typical for package configuration, and no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident. The high confidence scores reflect certainty about its benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, metadata-only, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports are accurate and consistent. No adjustments to the scores are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
