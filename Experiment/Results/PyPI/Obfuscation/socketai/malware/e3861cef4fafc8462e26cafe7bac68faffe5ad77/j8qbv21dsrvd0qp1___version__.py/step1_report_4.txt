{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define metadata variables related to a Python package, such as package name, description, version, author, email, license, and URL.",
  "sources": "Assignments of string literals to variables, which are static and not based on external input",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flows that process untrusted input or lead to data leaks or system effects",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present; the code only assigns static strings to variables",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets beyond standard metadata, or suspicious behavior are detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists of variable assignments containing package metadata such as name, description, version, author, contact email, license, and repository URL. All data are hardcoded static strings. There are no input sources, no data processing, and no sinks that could lead to malicious actions. The structure and content are typical for package setup or metadata files, with no obfuscation or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as metadata for a Python package. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are present.",
