  "flows": "Download script from remote URL -> Save locally -> Make executable -> Run script with parameters -> Install package via system command.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated or nonsensical subprocess function name 'uxDoFdeFQOoMaFUMEwhPWOUHBIpFGeHg', unusual variable naming, downloading and executing remote scripts, installing system packages, running shell commands.",
  "analysis": "The code downloads a script from a potentially untrusted external source ('https://fhost.devxops.eu.org/devops/cicd/scripts/dh-storage-v1.1.sh') using urllib. It saves this script to the user's home directory, makes it executable, and then runs it with specific parameters. It also updates system packages and installs 'tmux'. The script execution is carried out through a subprocess call with an obfuscated function name, which raises suspicion. The overall behavior resembles a typical supply chain risk: fetching remote code, executing it locally, and installing software, which could be malicious if the remote script is malicious. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets but exhibits signs of obfuscation and remote control. The pattern of downloading and executing remote scripts, especially with obfuscated function names, is commonly associated with malicious activity or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits behaviors consistent with malicious or potentially malicious activity, primarily due to fetching and executing remote code and using obfuscated function names. It warrants caution and further investigation of the remote script source. The overall security risk is high, and the code should not be considered safe without verifying the remote script's integrity and purpose.",
