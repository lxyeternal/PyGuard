  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that runs a post-install script and defines package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from '__version__.py' and README.md; executes a subprocess command in custom install class.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess execution of a Python command that imports and runs 'ptmpl.post_install.download_and_run_script()'.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom install class executes a subprocess that runs a Python code to invoke 'download_and_run_script' from 'ptmpl.post_install'.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic execution with 'exec' to load version info; obfuscated class and variable names; subprocess call that executes an external script without clear validation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that, upon installation, executes a Python subprocess invoking 'download_and_run_script' from 'ptmpl.post_install'. The subprocess command could be malicious if 'download_and_run_script' is malicious, as it runs code remotely or locally without verification. The code reads version info via 'exec', which is not inherently malicious but warrants caution. The obfuscated class name and variable names suggest an attempt to hide behavior. There is no obvious hardcoded credential or backdoor, but the subprocess call to run external code during installation is suspicious, especially given the lack of validation or checks. The overall setup seems standard, but the subprocess invocation is a potential security risk.\n",
  "conclusion": "The setup script includes a potentially malicious behavior by executing an external script during installation via subprocess. The obfuscation and the indirect call to 'download_and_run_script' raise concern for supply chain risks. While not definitively malicious, the code warrants review of the 'download_and_run_script' function for malicious activity.",
