{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up a Python package, including custom installation behavior that executes an external script during installation.",
  "sources": "Reading version information from a file (__version__.py), reading the README.md file, and environment variables during setup.",
  "sinks": "Execution of subprocess to run a Python command that imports and runs a function from ptmpl.post_install.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom install command runs a subprocess that executes a Python command: 'import ptmpl.post_install; ptmpl.post_install.download_and_run_script()'.",
  "anomalies": "The subprocess call runs a Python command that imports a module and executes a function, which may be used to download and execute remote code. The function name 'download_and_run_script' suggests remote code execution. The code also dynamically executes content from __version__.py without validation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, during installation, runs a subprocess executing a Python command to import a module and invoke 'download_and_run_script'. This pattern is suspicious because it indicates remote code execution at install time, potentially downloading and executing malicious code. The code reads version info dynamically from a file, which is common, but combined with the subprocess command, it raises concern. The setup process itself appears standard, but the subprocess invocation is unusual and potentially malicious. No other suspicious or malicious behavior is apparent in the rest of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The script includes a potentially malicious behavior where, during installation, it downloads and executes external code via a subprocess. This is a significant security concern and suggests malicious intent or backdoor functionality. The overall risk score is high due to the execution of external code at install time.",
