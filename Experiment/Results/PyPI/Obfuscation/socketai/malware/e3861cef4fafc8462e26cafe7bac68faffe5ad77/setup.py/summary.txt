  "conclusion": "The package contains a pattern of executing external code during installation, which is a significant security concern. The obfuscation and dynamic execution further heighten suspicion of malicious intent. The scores provided are consistent with the behavior. Until 'download_and_run_script()' is verified safe, the package should be considered potentially malicious."
