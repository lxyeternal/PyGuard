      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits behaviors consistent with malicious activity, including silent file overwrites, execution of scripts without validation, and directory manipulations. The pattern aligns with malware or supply chain attack tactics. The assigned scores (malware ~0.75, obfuscation ~0.4, security risk ~0.8) are justified. It should be treated as highly suspicious or malicious, warranting further investigation."
