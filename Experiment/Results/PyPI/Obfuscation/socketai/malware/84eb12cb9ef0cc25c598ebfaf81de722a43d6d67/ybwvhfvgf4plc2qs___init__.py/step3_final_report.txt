  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Import statements, data input points, environment variables, hardcoded strings, eval()/exec() calls, network addresses, embedded credentials.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, eval()/exec() execution, data exfiltration points, hardcoded secrets, environment variables, user inputs.",
  "flows": "Sources such as hardcoded strings or environment variables flow into eval()/exec() or network functions, potentially leading to malicious actions or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded IPs/hostnames, use of eval()/exec(), obfuscated or encoded strings decoded at runtime, embedded secrets, unvalidated user inputs.",
  "analysis": "Most reports correctly identify benign code with no suspicious patterns, assigning low malware and obfuscation scores. Report 5 highlights multiple high-risk indicators such as eval()/exec(), hardcoded addresses, and obfuscation, justifying high suspicion scores. The confidence levels reflect the amount of code context provided, with higher confidence in reports noting explicit suspicious features. The scores are consistent with the described behaviors, with benign reports maintaining low scores and the suspicious report justifying high scores.",
  "conclusion": "The overall evaluation aligns with the evidence; benign code is appropriately scored with low malware and obfuscation levels, while Report 5's suspicious features justify high scores. The assessments are consistent and justified based on the provided descriptions.",
