{
  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script using setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Static strings defining version, description, and package metadata; no untrusted input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; static configuration without dynamic data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names (e.g., LJmCFjysOMKKAByDafBnGFhSXhYlDZRo) and a typo in the description string ('oganize' instead of 'organize'), but these are superficial and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package, with static data and no dynamic or network activity. Variable name obfuscation appears stylistic rather than malicious. No code injection, credential handling, or malicious payloads are present. The obfuscation is superficial, and the description string, despite a typo, is benign. The code does not perform any suspicious operations or external data handling. The overall structure and content indicate a benign package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Python package setup script with superficial obfuscation. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks are detected. The malware score is set to 0, and the security risk score is minimal. The obfuscation score is moderate due to variable naming but not indicative of malicious intent.",
