{
  "purpose": "The script is setting up a Python package using setuptools, defining package metadata, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data: package name, version, description, keywords, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input sources or data sinks are present that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The flow involves static package setup data being processed by the setup() function, with no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "The variable names are obfuscated or non-descriptive, but they contain no code that performs unusual actions. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules (setuptools, codecs, os), defines variables with static strings, and calls setup() with package metadata. The variable names are unconventional but do not affect functionality or security. There are no code injection points, network connections, or data exfiltration behaviors. The code strictly performs package setup tasks, consistent with normal Python packaging scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard package setup script with obfuscated variable names. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are identified. It functions solely to package a Python module.",
