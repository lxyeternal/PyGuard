  "purpose": "Define setup configuration for a Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Static string assignments, the import statements, and the setup() function call.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function and its parameters, which do not execute untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code uses static data for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names with seemingly random strings; no direct malicious indicators or obfuscated code; the description string has a typo ('oganize' instead of 'organize').",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools and defines package metadata with static strings and an empty dependencies list. Variable names appear intentionally obfuscated but contain no active code or dynamic execution. The setup() call uses only static literals, and there is no user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The unusual variable names may suggest obfuscation but do not imply malicious intent. Overall, the script performs typical package setup configuration without malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names but no malicious activity or security risks detected. It appears to be a legitimate package configuration with no signs of malware or security issues.",
