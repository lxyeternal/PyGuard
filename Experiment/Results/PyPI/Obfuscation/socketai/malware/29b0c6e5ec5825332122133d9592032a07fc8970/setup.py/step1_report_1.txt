  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, defining metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Import statements (setuptools, codecs, os), hardcoded version and description strings, setup() function call with package info.",
  "sinks": "None identifiable; no untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "Imports and static strings flow into the setup() function call, but no untrusted data flow or external data handling occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of seemingly random variable names, but no malicious activity or obfuscation. Description string is simple and benign. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package setup script utilizing setuptools. The variable names are obfuscated but do not impact functionality or indicate malicious intent. The description string appears to be a benign description of a module library. No code injection, data leaks, or malicious behavior detected. No external network activity, system modifications, or suspicious code structures. Overall, the script is a typical package setup with obfuscated variable names, likely for stylistic reasons rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign setup script for a Python package with obfuscated variable names. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
