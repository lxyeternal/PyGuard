      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high likelihood of malicious activity due to obfuscated, stealthy execution of a PowerShell command during package setup. The use of encoded commands, silent execution, and conditional triggers are classic indicators of malicious payloads in supply chain attacks. The overall security risk is high, and further decoding of the payload is recommended for confirmation."
