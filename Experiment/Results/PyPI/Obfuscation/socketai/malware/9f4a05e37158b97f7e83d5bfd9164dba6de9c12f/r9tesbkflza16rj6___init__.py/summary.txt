  "confidence": 0.8,
  "conclusion": "The code executes an external script via an obfuscated function, raising moderate security concerns primarily due to obfuscation and external execution without validation. No direct malicious payload is present, but the potential for malicious behavior exists if the external script is compromised. The current scores are appropriate, with malware low and security risk moderate, warranting cautious review of the external script."
