{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package that, during installation, downloads and executes a remote script.",
  "sources": "The URL 'https://transfer.sh/gDhbfk/qrcodes.py' from which code is downloaded during installation.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'qrcodes.py' via subprocess.check_call, which runs the downloaded code with the Python interpreter.",
  "flows": "The setup process triggers a custom install command that downloads remote code from a URL (source) and then executes it (sink), potentially executing malicious code at install time.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names; dynamic code download and execution during package installation; no verification or validation of the downloaded script; use of remote URL and immediate execution without checks.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation command class that, when invoked, downloads a Python script from a remote URL and executes it immediately. The URL points to an external source, which can host any code, potentially malicious. The obfuscated class and method names suggest an attempt to hide functionality. There are no integrity checks, signatures, or validation mechanisms. The setup configuration includes typical package metadata, but the custom install command's behavior introduces a significant security risk by executing remote code during package installation, which is a common supply chain attack vector.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing remote code during package installation, which could lead to remote code execution on the host system. This is a high-security risk. The obfuscation and lack of validation strongly suggest malicious intent.",
