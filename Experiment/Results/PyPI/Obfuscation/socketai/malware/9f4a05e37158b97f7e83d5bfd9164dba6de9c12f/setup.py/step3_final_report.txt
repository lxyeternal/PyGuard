{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom setup installation that downloads and executes a remote Python script during package installation, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Requests to 'https://transfer.sh/gDhbfk/qrcodes.py' via requests.get(), reading the URL response content.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'qrcodes.py' via subprocess.check_call(), leading to remote code execution.",
  "flows": "Code fetches remote script -> saves as 'qrcodes.py' -> executes script with sys.executable -> potential malicious payload runs.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names, immediate execution of downloaded code without validation, use of an untrusted external URL, no signature verification.",
  "analysis": "The code's behavior involves downloading and executing remote code during setup, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. Obfuscated identifiers suggest an attempt to conceal malicious intent. The external URL is untrusted, and no validation is performed on the downloaded script. This pattern indicates high malicious potential and security risk. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.8-1.0, obfuscated ~0.8-0.9, security risk ~0.9-1.0) are justified given the behavior. The code should be considered highly malicious, with a malware score of 1.0 and security risk of 1.0, due to the active remote code execution during installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior by downloading and executing external code during setup, representing a severe supply chain security threat. The high scores in the reports are appropriate and justified. It should be flagged as malicious and avoided.",
