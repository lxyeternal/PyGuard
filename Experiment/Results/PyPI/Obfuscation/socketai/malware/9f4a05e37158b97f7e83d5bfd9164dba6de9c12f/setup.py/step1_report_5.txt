{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to fetch a Python script from a remote URL and execute it during installation.",
  "sources": "The URL 'https://transfer.sh/gDhbfk/qrcodes.py' is a source where the code retrieves an external script.",
  "sinks": "The fetched script 'qrcodes.py' is executed using subprocess.check_call, which could run arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "The code downloads 'qrcodes.py' from the remote URL and immediately executes it, creating a source-to-sink flow from URL to script execution.",
  "anomalies": "The code fetches and executes code from an external, potentially untrusted source during installation. Variable and class names are obfuscated, which may be an attempt to hide malicious intent. No validation or sandboxing is applied to the fetched script.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, then defines a class with an obfuscated name inheriting from 'install'. Within this class, it fetches a Python script from a remote URL using 'requests.get' and saves it locally as 'qrcodes.py'. Immediately after, it executes this script via 'subprocess.check_call'. The setup configuration contains obfuscated keys and metadata. The presence of external code fetching and execution during installation is suspicious, especially given the obfuscated names and lack of validation, indicating potential malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code downloads and executes remote code during installation, which is a significant security risk and could be used for malicious purposes such as installing backdoors or executing arbitrary malicious code. The obfuscation and remote execution strongly suggest malicious intent.",
