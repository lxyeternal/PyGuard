{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, with a custom install command that downloads and executes an external Python script.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from an external URL ('https://transfer.sh/gDhbfk/qrcodes.py') via requests.get() during installation.",
  "sinks": "The downloaded script ('qrcodes.py') is written to disk and then immediately executed with subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, 'qrcodes.py']).",
  "flows": "Input source: URL request; flow: download the script -> save to 'qrcodes.py' -> execute script.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes dynamically downloading and executing code during package installation without validation, which is highly suspicious. Variable names are obfuscated, indicating possible obfuscation or an attempt to hide malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that overrides the default install method. During installation, it fetches a remote Python script from an external URL, saves it locally as 'qrcodes.py', and executes it immediately. The URL appears to be a third-party transfer service, not an official source. The code then proceeds with standard setup. The use of dynamic code fetching and execution, combined with obfuscated variable names, strongly suggests malicious intent or supply chain sabotage. The script is potentially malicious as it can run arbitrary code from an external source during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The package includes a malicious behavior: downloading and executing remote code during installation. This is a significant security risk, indicating potential supply chain attack or malware distribution. The obfuscation and external code execution should be considered malicious activity.",
