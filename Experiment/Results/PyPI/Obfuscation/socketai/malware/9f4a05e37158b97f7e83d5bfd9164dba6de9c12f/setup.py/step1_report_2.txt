{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package that, during installation, downloads and executes an external script from a remote URL.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the URL 'https://transfer.sh/gDhbfk/qrcodes.py' via requests.get() during the custom install command execution.",
  "sinks": "The downloaded content is written to a file 'qrcodes.py' and immediately executed with subprocess.check_call(), leading to potential remote code execution.",
  "flows": "Input from the remote URL flows into writing 'qrcodes.py', which is then executed as a script during installation.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual naming conventions for classes and functions, the dynamic download and execution of remote code during package installation, and obfuscated-looking variable and class names. Also, the use of a remote URL for code execution is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom install class that overrides the install method. During installation, it downloads a Python script from a remote URL and executes it immediately. This behavior is a classic sign of malicious activity, such as remote code execution, backdoors, or payload delivery. The package metadata appears legitimate, but the malicious behavior occurs during the installation process. There are no other suspicious functions or obfuscated code beyond the dynamic download and execution. The code’s purpose seems to be to silently execute remote code upon installation, which is highly suspicious and potentially malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by downloading and executing remote code during installation, which could lead to remote code execution and system compromise. This behavior indicates high malicious intent and should be considered extremely dangerous.",
