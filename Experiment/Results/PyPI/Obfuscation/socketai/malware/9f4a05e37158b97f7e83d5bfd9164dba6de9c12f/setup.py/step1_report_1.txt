{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up a Python package named 'qrcoding' with version '1.0.1' and certain metadata. During installation, it fetches an external script and executes it, likely to perform additional setup or malicious activity.",
  "sources": "The code reads a URL 'https://transfer.sh/gDhbfk/qrcodes.py' to download a Python script during installation.",
  "sinks": "The downloaded script ('qrcodes.py') is saved locally and immediately executed via subprocess.check_call, potentially executing malicious code.",
  "flows": "The code fetches the script from an external URL (source), saves it locally, and then executes it (sink), which may lead to arbitrary code execution.",
  "anomalies": "The function names and class names are obfuscated and nonsensical, indicating an attempt to conceal intent. The script downloads and executes code from an external source during setup, which is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools and extends the install command to include a custom step. This step downloads a script from a remote URL and executes it immediately, bypassing typical setup security measures. The obfuscated naming and remote code execution during installation are strong indicators of malicious intent or supply chain compromise.",
  "conclusion": "The package includes obfuscated code that fetches and executes a remote script during installation, posing a significant security risk. This behavior could allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on systems installing this package, indicating malicious or supply chain malicious activity.",
