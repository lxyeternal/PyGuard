  "purpose": "Execute an external Python script named 'my_script.py' when the module runs as the main program.",
  "sources": "os.system call executing 'python my_script.py'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of system command via os.system, which can run arbitrary commands.",
  "flows": "Main entry point triggers pZnRXeFOCovDkesoNWvCVDTKbemQTNor() -> os.system('python my_script.py').",
  "anomalies": "Use of a highly obfuscated function name; execution of an external script with a hardcoded command.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function with a non-descriptive name that calls os.system to run 'python my_script.py'. This function is invoked only if the script is run directly. The use of os.system with a fixed string indicates a potential for executing arbitrary scripts, which could be malicious if 'my_script.py' contains harmful code. The obfuscated function name adds suspicion, as it may be intended to hide malicious intent. There are no other inputs, no user interaction, and no data validation, which increases risk if 'my_script.py' is malicious. Overall, the code is simple but could facilitate malicious behavior by executing external code.",
  "conclusion": "The code executes an external script via a system call, which poses a security risk if 'my_script.py' is malicious. The obfuscated function name and lack of validation are suspicious. Overall, this code can be used maliciously to run arbitrary scripts, making it a potential security concern.",
