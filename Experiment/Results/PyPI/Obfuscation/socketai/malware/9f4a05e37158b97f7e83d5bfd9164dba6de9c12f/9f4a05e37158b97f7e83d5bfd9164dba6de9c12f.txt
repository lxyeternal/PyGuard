      "conclusion": "The code executes an external script via an obfuscated function, raising moderate security concerns primarily due to obfuscation and external execution without validation. No direct malicious payload is present, but the potential for malicious behavior exists if the external script is compromised. The current scores are appropriate, with malware low and security risk moderate, warranting cautious review of the external script."

      "conclusion": "The code acts as a trigger for executing an external script, with obfuscation raising suspicion. It is not inherently malicious but could facilitate malicious activity if 'my_script.py' is harmful. The security concern stems from external script execution and obfuscation, warranting cautious handling. The scores are appropriate; the malware score remains low, but the obfuscation and risk scores are justified as high/moderate."
