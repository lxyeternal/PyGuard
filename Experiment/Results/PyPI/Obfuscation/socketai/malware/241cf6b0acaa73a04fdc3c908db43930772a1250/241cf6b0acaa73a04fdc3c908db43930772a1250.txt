      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to obfuscated, silent PowerShell execution during setup. The high obfuscation and stealth tactics justify elevated malware and security risk scores. Further decoding of the PowerShell command is recommended to confirm malicious intent. The assessments and scores in the reports are consistent and appropriate given the evidence."
