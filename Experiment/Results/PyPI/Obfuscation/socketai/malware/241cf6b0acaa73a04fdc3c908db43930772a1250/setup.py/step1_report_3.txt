{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be a setup script for a Python package, but it includes obfuscated code intended to execute a PowerShell command silently.",
  "sources": "Reading the file system to check for the existence of 'tahg' and reading the environment for package setup metadata.",
  "sinks": "Execution of a PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen, which may perform malicious actions or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "If 'tahg' does not exist, the code executes a hidden PowerShell command, potentially leading to remote code execution or data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated PowerShell command encoded in Base64, executed with hidden window, and silently without error reporting; the command's content is hidden and suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with a standard setup import but then checks for the presence of a directory 'tahg'. If not found, it runs an encoded PowerShell command in a hidden process. The command is obfuscated, making it likely malicious or at least suspicious. The setup function is called normally but is wrapped in try-except with no error handling, which could hide failures. The presence of encoded PowerShell and silent execution is indicative of potential malicious intent, possibly for remote control, data collection, or other malicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains obfuscated malicious behavior likely intended to execute hidden PowerShell commands for potentially harmful purposes. The setup code itself appears legitimate, but the inclusion of hidden, encoded remote execution commands indicates malicious activity. The overall security risk is high due to the hidden, suspicious PowerShell execution.",
