  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code reading input data, environment variables, network connections, file operations, dynamic code evaluation.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows leading to data leaks, code execution, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Sources such as user input or environment variables to sinks like eval(), exec(), network transmission, or file writes.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation scores without clear malicious activity, suspicious dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or unusual import patterns.",
  "analysis": "Most reports correctly identify the scope and suspicious features. Minimal or empty code is appropriately scored with low malware and risk. Suspicious obfuscation in report 3 is justified, but malware suspicion should be slightly lowered if no concrete malicious activity is observed. Scores are generally consistent with descriptions. Slight adjustments include reducing malware from 0.2 to 0.15 in report 3, and setting risk to 0 in reports with no code (2 and 4). Obfuscation scores in report 3 remain high due to suspicion but could be moderated if evidence is weak. Overall, the assessments are aligned with the evidence, with minor score refinements recommended.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets are mostly benign or insufficient for malicious activity. Suspicion arises primarily from obfuscation in report 3, but no concrete malicious behavior is confirmed. Scores are mostly appropriate; minor adjustments improve consistency. No reports indicate confirmed malware, and risk levels are low across the board.",
