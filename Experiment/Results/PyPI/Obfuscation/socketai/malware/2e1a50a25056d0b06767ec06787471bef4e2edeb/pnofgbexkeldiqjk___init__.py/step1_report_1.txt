{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly clear due to lack of comments or documentation; it appears to be some form of script that imports modules and potentially processes data.",
  "sources": "The code reads input or data from imported modules and possibly from environment variables or external sources if present in unseen parts of the code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include data being sent over network connections, written to files, or used in system commands, but these are not explicitly visible in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flow paths are uncertain without seeing actual function calls or data handling; if present, input could flow into functions that process or transmit it.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious imports, or obfuscated code are evident in the visible snippet. The code appears straightforward but is incomplete for full assessment.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting mainly of import statements with no evident malicious constructs such as dynamic execution, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic. Without further content, no suspicious behavior can be conclusively identified. The lack of visible network operations, data leaks, or malicious system calls suggests low risk, but the incomplete nature limits full confidence.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears benign, but due to the limited scope, low confidence is assigned. No malware or obfuscation detected.",
  "confidence": 0.3,
  "obfuscated": 0,
