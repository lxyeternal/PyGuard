{
  "purpose": "Setup and package configuration with potential malicious code for remote retrieval and execution.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file, retrieving URL 'https://frvezdff.pythonanywhere.com/getrnr', environment variables 'APPDATA' and 'LOCALAPPDATA'.",
  "sinks": "Downloading and executing remote script ('gamer.bat') via subprocess and os.system, copying files to local directories.",
  "flows": "URL retrieval from remote server -> saving as 'gamer.bat' in APPDATA -> executing 'gamer.bat' -> copying 'gamer.bat' to LOCALAPPDATA -> executing 'gamer.bat' again.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names, hardcoded URL pointing to potentially malicious server, remote script download, and execution without validation or user consent. Multiple broad exception handlers suppress errors. Use of 'os.system' and 'subprocess' for executing external scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and sets up a package with seemingly benign metadata, but it also contains code that downloads a script from an external URL ('https://frvezdff.pythonanywhere.com/getrnr') and executes it via batch files. The environment variables 'APPDATA' and 'LOCALAPPDATA' are used to store and run the script, indicating persistence or stealth tactics. The use of 'subprocess' with 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' suppresses command window display. All these behaviors suggest an attempt to fetch, store, and run potentially malicious code covertly. The obfuscated variable names and broad exception handling are typical of malicious scripts aiming to hide their behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears designed to secretly download and execute remote code from an external server, indicating malicious intent with high confidence. It leverages environment variables for persistence and uses obfuscation techniques. The overall security risk is high due to remote code execution capabilities.",
