{
  "purpose": "The functions appear to be placeholders for operations involving cookies, username, and password, possibly related to authentication or session management.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'cookie' for the first function; 'username' and 'password' for the second function.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the functions do not perform any operations or data outputs.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or operations within the functions; parameters are not used or manipulated.",
  "anomalies": "Both functions are defined but contain no implementation or logic; no obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of function definitions with long, seemingly random function names and parameters but no implementation. This could be indicative of placeholders or intentionally obfuscated code, but in their current form, they do not perform any actions. No data is read, processed, or transmitted, and no malicious behavior or security issues are observable. The absence of implementation limits the ability to assess intent or potential risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be placeholder functions with no active logic or behavior. There is no evidence of malicious intent, data leakage, or security risks in their current form.",
