  "purpose": "Placeholder functions with obfuscated names, likely intended for handling cookies and credentials, but currently inactive.",
  "sources": "Function parameters: 'cookie', 'username', 'password' (potentially sensitive data inputs).",
  "sinks": "No active sinks or data flows; functions are empty.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs as functions contain no logic.",
  "anomalies": "Functions have obfuscated names and are empty; no implementation present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two empty functions with obfuscated names, accepting parameters that suggest handling of sensitive data. There are no data flows, sinks, or malicious activities. The obfuscation of function names raises suspicion but is not indicative of malicious intent given the lack of logic. Malware score is zero, consistent with no active malicious code. Obfuscation score is high (~0.75), justified by the naming. Security risk score is low (~0.1), reflecting the placeholder nature. Confidence in the benign assessment is moderate (~0.3-0.4), but the high obfuscation warrants cautious monitoring if code is expanded.",
  "conclusion": "The code is currently benign placeholder functions with obfuscated names, showing no active malicious behavior or security risks. The high obfuscation warrants attention if further logic is added, but as-is, there is no evidence of malicious activity.",
