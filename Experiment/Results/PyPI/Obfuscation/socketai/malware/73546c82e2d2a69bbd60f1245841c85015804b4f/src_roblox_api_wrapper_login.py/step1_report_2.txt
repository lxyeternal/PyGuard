  "purpose": "Placeholder functions with no implementation, possibly intended for handling cookies and login credentials.",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'cookie', 'username', 'password' (potential input sources).",
  "sinks": "No sinks observed as functions are empty; no data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs within the functions since they are empty and do not perform any operations.",
  "anomalies": "Functions have obfuscated names, which could be an attempt to hide their true purpose. No internal logic or implementation present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two functions with obfuscated names, both defined without any implementation or logic. No input processing, data transmission, or security-sensitive operations are present. The lack of implementation makes it impossible to determine intent, but the obfuscation raises suspicion of intent to hide malicious activity if expanded later. As it stands, there are no suspicious behaviors, but the structure suggests potential for malicious use if code is added later.",
  "conclusion": "The code is currently inactive with placeholder functions and obfuscated names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in its current form, but the obfuscated naming warrants caution if expanded. No immediate threats are identified.",
