{
  "purpose": "To evaluate supply chain security of the provided Python code snippets, identifying malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on code analysis.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, user inputs, external network connections, hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), variable names, and data flows from sources to sinks.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, data exfiltration points, dynamic code execution, and external resource access.",
  "flows": "Sources such as untrusted input or environment variables flow into sinks like network connections, eval/exec calls, or data storage, indicating potential malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval()/exec() on untrusted input, hardcoded IPs/credentials, obfuscated variable names, external network connections, and data exfiltration indicators.",
  "analysis": "The benign code snippets (Reports 1, 2, 3, 5) show standard data processing without suspicious patterns, justifying low malware and obfuscation scores. Report 4 exhibits multiple malicious indicators such as eval() usage, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, and network activity, warranting high malware (0.7), obfuscation (0.6), and security risk (0.75) scores. The confidence levels are high, and the scores are consistent with the described behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The analysis confirms that benign reports are correctly scored with minimal risk, while the suspicious code in Report 4 is appropriately assigned high malware and obfuscation scores. The scoring accurately reflects the observed code features and potential security threats.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
