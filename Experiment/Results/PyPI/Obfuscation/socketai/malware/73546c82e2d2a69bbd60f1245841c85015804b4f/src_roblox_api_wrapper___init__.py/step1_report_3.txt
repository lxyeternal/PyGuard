  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be a Python module that might perform data processing or utility functions based on its structure.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input variables, environment variables, and possibly external modules or files if present (not explicitly shown).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or environment variable modifications if such code exists elsewhere, but none are explicitly visible in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (such as function arguments or environment variables) through internal processing functions; no explicit flow to external sinks is evident in the visible code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are evident in the provided code snippet. No backdoors or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "A detailed examination of the code reveals straightforward logic with standard usage of Python features. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behaviors, or suspicious patterns such as dynamic execution, hidden backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code appears to be a typical utility or data processing script, relying on common libraries and standard coding practices.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks. The code appears benign, with no evidence of malware or security vulnerabilities within the scope of this review.",
