      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious intent, involving remote code retrieval, execution, obfuscation, and persistence tactics. The behavior is characteristic of malware, warranting maximum malware and security risk scores. The obfuscation is evident but not highly complex, meriting a high obfuscation score. Overall, the package should be considered malicious."
