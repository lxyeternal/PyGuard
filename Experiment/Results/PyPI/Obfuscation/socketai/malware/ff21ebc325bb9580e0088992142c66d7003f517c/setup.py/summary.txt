  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during setup, triggered conditionally and with silent error handling. The scores assigned are consistent with this behavior. Until the command is decoded, it should be treated as a high-severity security concern, indicative of potential supply chain compromise or malicious payload delivery."
