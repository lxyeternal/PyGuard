The malware score is low (around 0.1-0.2), and the security risk is also low (around 0.2-0.3)."

It should be treated as potentially malicious, warranting further analysis of the decoded payload to confirm intent."

There is no direct evidence of malicious activity, but the obfuscation and stream manipulation could be exploited. The low malware score is appropriate, and the moderate risk score reflects potential misuse. Further review of the broader context and imported modules is recommended."

The obfuscation is superficial and does not indicate malicious intent. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score should be set to 0. The obfuscation score is high due to the nonsensical naming and dynamic attribute setting, but this is consistent with obfuscation practices. Overall, the code is benign and does not pose a security threat in its current form."

Overall, the risk is low, but further review of the imported module is recommended to ensure it does not contain malicious code."
