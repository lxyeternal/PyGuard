  "conclusion": "The code functions as a utility for output stream handling with obfuscation that warrants caution. There is no direct evidence of malicious activity, but the obfuscation and stream manipulation could be exploited. The low malware score is appropriate, and the moderate risk score reflects potential misuse. Further review of the broader context and imported modules is recommended."
