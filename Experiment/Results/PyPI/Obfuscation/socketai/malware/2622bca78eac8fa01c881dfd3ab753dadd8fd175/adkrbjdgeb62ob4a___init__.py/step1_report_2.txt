  "flows": "Imports -> base64 decode -> compile -> exec",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding and dynamic execution via exec() and compile() with no obvious benign purpose; obfuscated import structure.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions from local modules, then proceeds to decode a base64 string which, when decoded, contains code that imports 'tempfile', 'urllib.request', and makes an HTTP request to a specific IP address. It then compiles and executes this code dynamically using exec(). This pattern is typical of obfuscated malicious scripts attempting to hide their true intent. The string 'TPTBBmEODargZCEbKaPGhabXyJABGKuC' appears to be a version identifier but does not mitigate the suspicious nature of the dynamic code execution. The use of 'exec' with decoded code from base64 is a significant red flag for malicious activity, such as retrieving and executing remote payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits obfuscated and suspicious behavior, notably decoding and executing dynamically generated code from base64, which is a common technique for malware delivery or malicious behavior. The import statements and version string do not appear benign given the context of dynamic code execution. This pattern suggests malicious intent, potentially to fetch and run malicious payloads at runtime.",
