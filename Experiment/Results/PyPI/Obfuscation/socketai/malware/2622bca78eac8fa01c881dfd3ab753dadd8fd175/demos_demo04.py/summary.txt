  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, primarily printing static, obfuscated strings. No evidence of malicious behavior is present. The obfuscation raises suspicion but is not definitive. Overall, the risk is low, but further review of the imported module is recommended to ensure it does not contain malicious code."
