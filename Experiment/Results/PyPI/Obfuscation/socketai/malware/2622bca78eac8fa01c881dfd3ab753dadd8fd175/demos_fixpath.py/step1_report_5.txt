  "purpose": "Modify the Python module search path to include the parent directory of the current file.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current file's directory via __file__ and constructs a path to its parent directory.",
  "sinks": "The code inserts the parent directory path into sys.path, affecting module import behavior.",
  "flows": "Source (__file__) -> path construction -> sys.path insertion",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code performs a common pattern of adjusting sys.path for relative imports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys and os.path functions, constructs the parent directory path of the current script, and prepends it to sys.path. This is a standard way to modify import paths to include modules from a sibling or parent directory. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or malicious code behavior is present. The code does not perform any network operations, data leaks, or execute untrusted code. The purpose appears to be setting up the module import environment, which is typical in package development or complex projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard pattern for managing module import paths in Python projects. It does not contain any malicious intent or security risks.",
