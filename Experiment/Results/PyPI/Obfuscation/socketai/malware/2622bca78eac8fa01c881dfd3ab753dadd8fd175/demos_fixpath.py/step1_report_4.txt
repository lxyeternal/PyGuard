  "purpose": "Adjusts the Python module search path to include the parent directory of the current script.",
  "sources": "Reading the special variable __file__ to determine current script location.",
  "sinks": "Modifying sys.path to influence module import behavior.",
  "flows": "Input (__file__) -> normpath/join -> sys.path.insert",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable name 'ZKumWPIdZePzGoOWZINQucOfeLCIfZuV'; no other suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a normalized path to the parent directory of the current script and prepends it to sys.path to influence module imports. The variable name appears obfuscated, but the operations are standard path manipulations without dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leakage. No hardcoded secrets, malicious behavior, or obfuscation beyond variable naming are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a common operation of adjusting the module search path for importing local modules. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
