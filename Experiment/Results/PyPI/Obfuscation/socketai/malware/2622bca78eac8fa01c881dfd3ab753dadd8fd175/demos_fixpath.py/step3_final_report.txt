  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable name 'ZKumWPIdZePzGoOWZINQucOfeLCIfZuV' but no malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard relative path setup for module imports. It uses __file__ to find the script's directory, computes its parent, and inserts it at the start of sys.path. No network activity, data leakage, or malicious payloads are evident. The obfuscated variable name is superficial and does not impact functionality. The code is a common pattern in Python projects for managing relative imports, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, implementing a typical relative import path adjustment. No malicious behavior or security risks are present. The obfuscation is superficial and not indicative of malicious activity.",
