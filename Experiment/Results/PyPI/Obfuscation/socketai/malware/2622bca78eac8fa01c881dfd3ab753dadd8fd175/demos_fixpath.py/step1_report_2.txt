  "purpose": "Adjusts the Python module search path by adding the parent directory of the current script.",
  "sources": "Reads the current script's file path (__file__) and constructs a new path based on it.",
  "sinks": "Modifies sys.path to include the parent directory of the current script.",
  "flows": "Source (__file__) -> normpath/join -> sys.path.insert",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic path manipulation; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious operations detected.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically computes the parent directory of the current script and inserts it at the beginning of sys.path, likely to facilitate local module imports. This is a common practice for relative imports or custom module loading. No malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful system modifications is evident. No obfuscated or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard path manipulation for module import purposes without any signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
