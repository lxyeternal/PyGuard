      "conclusion": "The code exhibits covert data exfiltration behavior via DNS queries during package setup, with obfuscated code and suspicious network activity. While no explicit payloads or backdoors are present, the pattern indicates high suspicion of malicious intent. The malware score should be high, and the security risk level is significant, warranting caution and further investigation."
