{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script with a custom install class that, on Windows systems, decrypts and executes a hardcoded payload during installation, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "OS check (os.name), import statements (requests, fernet), hardcoded encrypted string, decryption key, exec() call with decrypted code.",
  "sinks": "exec() executing decrypted code, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.",
  "flows": "OS check -> import modules -> decrypt payload -> execute decrypted code.",
  "anomalies": "Encrypted payload embedded in code, use of runtime decryption and exec(), obfuscated variable names, conditional execution only on Windows, import of network and cryptography modules in setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a conditional check for Windows OS, then imports requests and Fernet modules, decrypts a hardcoded encrypted string with a static key, and executes the decrypted code via exec(). The presence of encrypted payloads, obfuscated variable names, and runtime execution strongly suggest malicious behavior. The pattern aligns with common malware techniques such as stealth, obfuscation, and dynamic code execution. The high likelihood of malicious intent is supported by the use of runtime decryption and execution, which can facilitate arbitrary code execution or backdoors. The scores assigned in the reports (malware close to 1, obfuscation around 0.8-0.9, security risk near 1) are consistent with this analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior through runtime decryption and execution of an embedded payload, with obfuscation and conditional targeting of Windows systems. The high scores assigned are justified, indicating a high probability of malicious activity. The package should be considered highly suspicious or malicious, and further analysis of the decrypted payload is recommended for confirmation.",
