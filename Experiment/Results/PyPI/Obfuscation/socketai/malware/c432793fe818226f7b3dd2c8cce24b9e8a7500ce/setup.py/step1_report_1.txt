  "purpose": "Define a custom installation process that may execute malicious code during package installation.",
  "sources": "os.name check, execution of decrypted Fernet-encrypted code, import statements for requests and Fernet.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing decrypted code, possibly malicious payload.",
  "flows": "Detection of OS check -> conditional import of requests and Fernet -> decryption of embedded payload -> execution via exec() during install.",
  "anomalies": "Encrypted payload decrypted and executed during install; hardcoded encrypted string; unusual use of Fernet and requests within an install class; no legitimate reason for executing decrypted code here.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup script with a custom install class. Within the install class, if the OS is Windows, it imports requests and Fernet, then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted string and executes it via exec(). The encrypted data is embedded in the code, suggesting obfuscation. The use of exec() with decrypted code is highly suspicious, as it could run malicious payloads. The code appears designed to silently execute code during installation, which is a common tactic for malicious package behavior. The setup parameters and metadata appear legitimate but are likely crafted to hide malicious activity. The encrypted payload and exec() are the primary concerns indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a high likelihood of malicious behavior due to runtime decryption and execution of code during installation, specifically targeting Windows systems. This behavior is typical of malicious packages attempting to run hidden payloads during setup.",
